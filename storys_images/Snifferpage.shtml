              <p>(M/F: blackmail; illustrated) </p>
              <p> My co-blackmailers call me the sniffer. They say it with a lot of 
          respect because I do them a lot of good turns, just as they do me some. 
          What I am basically is a hacker, though not an especially skillful one. 
          What makes me important is because I work in a big company with a big 
          intranet to connect everybody's computers up. What nobody there has 
          ever suspected is that I've got some specially written packet sniffing 
          software installed in my PC and a second ethernet card on the network 
          set up in promiscuous mode. 
        <p> Promiscuous mode! Ha, I like that -- being promiscuous is what it's 
          all about. That and being very, very careful. The allies would have 
          rather lost a battle in the war than let the Germans know that their 
          Enigma codes had been broken. I work on the same principle. 
        <p> The trick is the background software which looks at all the data packages 
          and only pulls out the IP sources and destination addresses that I supply. 
          And all that I'm interested in are certain e-mail addresses. 
        <p> Like I said, I work in a big building for a big company, and there 
          are over three hundred people using e-mail every day. Not only on the 
          intranet, but also out into the internet as well. I've long since acquired 
          all sorts of details about a certain type of e-mail user. 
        <p> What sort? The female sort, particularly the ones who been married 
          for a good while and who outwardly look to be the most respectable women 
          around. I download as many of their e-mail messages as I can find each 
          day. Then, before I go home, I run them all through a little search 
          program I've written. All it does it seek out a few key words:<i> 'meeting'; 
          'what time'; 'usual place'; 'after work'; 'bar'; 'husband'; 'wife'; 
          'excuse'; 'love you'. </i>Those are just a few of my favourite text 
          recaptures. I also have quite a few crude words in the program as well. 
        <p> Yes, you've surely guessed it. I'm always on the lookout for those 
          naughty ladies having a bit of fun on the side with gentleman they are 
          not supposed to be having an intimate relationship with. 
        <p> Now you might think that in this technological age anybody with enough 
          brains to be allowed to sit behind a computer in an office would know 
          that e-mail and mobile phones are both about as private ways of communicating 
          as sending up smoke signals. Well, you might think that, but in most 
          cases you'd be totally wrong. Men and women alike seem blissfully unaware 
          of how total insecure telecommunications are at all levels. Still, I'm 
          not complaining, where would snoops like me be if the world wasn't chock 
          full of fools? 
        <p> For a while, back when I was a kid, I thought a lot about becoming 
          a priest. The attraction was the idea of being able to go into a confession 
          box and listen to everybody telling me all their darkest and dirtiest 
          secrets. I had to give up on that idea eventually but being an e-mail 
          eavesdropper is probably even more fun because those gals just let it 
          all hang out. <i> 'When a woman thinks, she must post'. </i>That's what 
          Shakespeare wrote, or at least it's what he'd write now if he could 
          see what I turn up. 
        <p> Generally I have at least a dozen on-going targets provoking my interest. 
          But I'm never in any great rush. I want to know something about each 
          of them, apart from what I routinely hack out of their personal records 
          files. Basically, I want to know why a woman is having an extra-marital 
          affair. Is it because she's totally sick of her married life or is it 
          because it she's just become so mind numbingly bored that she has to 
          have a little fling now and then to keep her self respect? 
        <p> It's not that I've got any interest at all in being a marriage guidance 
          counsellor. What I want are the targets which are vulnerable to pressure. 
          The women who still value their marriage, just as long as they can escape 
          from it now and then. 
        <p> I usually get an understanding pretty soon of where a girl is coming 
          from. The more concerned she is to keep everything secret, the more 
          she obviously thinks she has to lose. The more self excuses there are 
          in the posts to her lover, the better. A guilty conscience is pricking 
          her, though probably not as much as he is. 
        <p> OK, so by the time I've sorted through the target e-mail files I can 
          generally count on having four or five women at any one time which look 
          pretty good. I mean they look pretty good as far as their correspondence 
          goes. 
        <p> The next thing I want to know is what they look like. I stay as much 
          as possible in my own small office and socialise as little as possible 
          with as few people as possible. That's my nature, I'm just not very 
          good at meatworld interaction. Nobody worries about it because I'm a 
          well known computer nerd. So I have to go out and do a quick reality 
          check on each target before I can grade them for their sexiness. But 
          I don't even bother to look at them unless they come to work in their 
          own car. 
        <p> Almost always they do because the company offices are out of town 
          and driving is much the most convenient way of commuting to work. So 
          what goes at the top of the list is a good looking lady driving her 
          own car and having an affair she really wants to keep a secret. 
        <p> What I do next is keep a close watch on her e-mail to find out when 
          the next assignation is going to take place. That part is easy, it's 
          the where which isn't. Sometimes a place will be mentioned, a bar or 
          an hotel, but more often than not its just <i>'your place',</i> or <i> 
          'the usual place'.</i> 
        <p> Once upon a time the only way to solve that part of the puzzle would 
          have been to put on a trench coat and a trilby hat and trail the beauty 
          to her den of vice. What I do nowadays is to pull her auto licence number 
          off the company's personal records. Then, on the morning of the day 
          the meeting is due, I stop by the vehicle in the company car park and 
          slip a small magnetic box under the fender. Inside is a GPS receiver 
          and a data collection chip. The next day I collect the GPS, download 
          it and plot the co-ordinates on the local map. It takes me about two 
          minutes to determine exactly where the car was parked at the time of 
          the rendezvous. Then I put a fresh roll of film in my camera and wait 
          for the next time the happy couple arrange a date 
        <p> When I first started thinking about all this I had some pretty wild 
          ideas of stalking each target and photographing them kissing their boyfriends 
          wildly on the doorstep. Real private eye work, hey, and maybe putting 
          bugging devices on the apartment windows and all that stuff. But why 
          bother? You go to the area, find the auto and then take a photograph 
          of it, a long shot with some other cars in the scene.Then you go away 
          for half an hour, come back and find some of the other cars have left 
          and other ones have arrived. So you take another shot, and maybe another 
          one when the target's getting in her car and leaving. 
        <p> If it's parked out in the street, some sunshine is handy, so the shadows 
          show the passage of time. Maybe it starts out sunny and then starts 
          raining. Again, the shots prove where her car has been parked, and that 
          it was parked there for some time. And I'll usually go through the same 
          procedure two or three times with each target before I've got the dossier 
          I want. The place, how often she's been there, the time she spent there 
          on each visit, and the photos of the car in identifiable surroundings 
          and obviously parked up there a lot of times. 
        <p> To round things off though it's nice to know exactly who it is she's 
          seeing. Which is where my little gang of buddies come in. Sooner or 
          later I'll have one of them waiting in the area when she's organised 
          a meeting. Almost before she's parked up he'll be on her case and ready 
          to follow her to where she's going. It wouldn't do for me to try that, 
          naturally. I might be spotted and recognised from work. 
        <p> Once I've got the dossier together, I send it to the lady in question, 
          with the photos and the address she's been visiting so much and for 
          so long, and a suggestion that we have a talk about things. 
        <p> Of course I pass all this on by snail mail. The last thing I want 
          to do is to have any of these women realise that they were betrayed 
          by their own e-mail. All they're told in the letter is that they were 
          seen leaving their car in an areas where they don't live and the person 
          who spotted them was curious enough to find out what was happening. 
          As a committed Christian he's wondering whether he should pass on this 
          information to her husband. Having looked through the dossier, maybe 
          she'd like to meet him and discuss what should happen next. 
        <p> So what does happen next? Here's a woman who knows she's in deep shit, 
          who knows her secret is already known to somebody who knows her, and 
          she doesn't have much choice but to go to the meeting she's been told 
          to. I usually arrange it at a McDonalds, which is a tad reassuring for 
          her. After all, nothing dramatic could ever happen at a McDonalds. 
        <p> When she gets there she's met by my friend Chris. Chris is a smoothtalking, 
          hard looking guy with a shaven head who comes on with all the self confidence 
          of a born gangster. 
        <p> So Chris greets the target, sits down beside her, starts talking whilst 
          she's still trying to figure out what's going on. Sure, he says, he 
          knows about what she's been doing because he was told by somebody who 
          works at her company. The same guy who just happened to spot her sliding 
          off for a little taste of fun on the side and wrote her to come in today. 
          Whoever it was told Chris as a favor to him and now Chris wants to do 
          a deal with her. 
        <p> Of course this throws the target. She thought she was going to meet 
          somebody she knew, not a total stranger. She certainly didn't expect 
          anybody like Chris. So what sort of a deal is he talking about and what's 
          in it for him? 
        <p> What sort of deal? Chris laughs and just then another of his friends 
          joins him at the table, another husky guy, introduced as Ed. Well, says 
          Chris, this has happened before. The deep throat at her workplace has 
          already put the finger on another lady that was having a fling on the 
          side. And since she was was sinning already everybody figured a little 
          extra sin wouldn't make much difference. Even she decided that way eventually. 
          Does the name Maria Vincetti sound familiar? 
        <p> OK, that's the general way it works. Let me tell you about an actual 
          example that happened a couple of weeks ago. 
        <p> I'm in the McDonalds as well but way back, almost out of sight, and 
          the woman who's just walked in looking very nervous is called Sue Salterly. 
          Now this Sue is a target I've been tracking for a long time, a thirty 
          something year old blue eyed blonde with legs guaranted to get a second 
          look from every guy who sees them. 
        <p> At work she looks as innocent as a Sunday school teacher, let alone 
          the respectable married woman that she's supposed to be. Yet I know 
          she's having a steaming hot affair with a guy over on the other side 
          of town, chasing over to his pad at least twice a week to top up her 
          tank with some high octane gas after years of getting by on regular 
          unleaded. And I didn't say that, she said it herself in her own e-mail 
          to her boyfriend. 
        <p> But now she's worried, really worried, because it looks as if the 
          nice tidy pattern of her life is going to become really unravelled. 
          Shame and scandal and a big glass window looming over her career path 
          - a glass window smeared with dirt. She's staring at Chris and Ed, and 
          she hasn't got the slightest interest in the glasses wearing geek taking 
          an occasional peek over a computer magazine at the other end of the 
          restaurant. Hell, I could lay my anorak over a puddle for her to step 
          on and she wouldn't remember me from work. 
        <p> Still, we've got to the interesting bit now. Does she know Mrs Vincetti? 
          I know that's the point in the spiel Chris has reached and I can see 
          that Sue is nodding ... Sure, she knows Senior Office Manager Vincetti. 
          Everybody at the company is afraid of the bossy bitch. Chris grins and 
          lays down a big glossy pix as if he was Wild Bill playing an ace in 
          Dodge City. 
        <p> I see Sue's face suddenly tighten in surprise as she looks at it. 
          Ms Vincetti, on her hands and knees in a darkened room with a flashlight 
          shining on her from a few feet away. Ms Vincetti, as ever is, wearing 
          nothing but a silk scarf tied around her wrists, with her large tits 
          getting a double handed mauling from either side. Apart from the udder 
          pullers another athletic male body also looms against her from out of 
          the shadows, thrusting forward as he takes her from behind. The manager's 
          hair is a mess, her mouth is hanging open and despite her executive 
          position she looks as if she's getting quite a thrill out of her present 
          position. 
        <p> Which, incidentally, is quite true. When she got the treatment she 
          went into convulsions at the first touch. By the time her saddle had 
          been filled and emptied four or five times she was virtually off the 
          planet. But that was then, this is now. Ms Salterly has taken a few 
          seconds checking out the scene on the print and a few more looking up 
          at the guys and already she knows exactly what's in the deal for Chris 
          and Ed -- she is. She can also see at a glance that they're serious, 
          they've pulled this blackmail stunt before and they've obviously been 
          successful with it. Astonishingly successful, to get a strong willed 
          bitch like Maria Vincetti to go along with them. 
        <p> So while Sue is still staring at them with bulging eyes Chris is quietly 
          and conscisely explaining exactly where things stand. If Sue wants her 
          husband left in happy ignorance then she's going to have to put out 
          like Laura Vincetti has done -- but nobody is telling any stories in 
          the offices about Ms Vincetti, are they? And the reason for that is 
          because Chris and Ed are very, very discreet. Maria turned up when she 
          was told told to and did as she was told to, so Mr Vincetti never got 
          to hear about her original indiscretion and nobody at the company knows 
          anything about this little bit of fun. Chris taps the photograph again 
          to make his point. 
        <p> In the seven times we've played this scenario out we've had one outright 
          refusal, just one woman who threw the picture down and walked, defying 
          us to do our worse. I promptly sent her a letter asssuring her she was 
          quite safe and that nobody was going to tell on her secret. The last 
          thing I wanted was to have her feel she needed any help from anybody. 
          A month later the same woman saw Chris in the street by pure accident 
          and she virtually begged him to start blackmailing her again. Once she 
          stopped being nervous she was as willing a screw as any of the sluts 
          we've ever slung up by their heels. 
        <p> Just now though Ms Salterly is still playing at being embarrassed, 
          blushing and trying to give the photo back to Chris. But then yet another 
          young guy comes along and joins the group, another hunk. Chris introduces 
          him as Don. Just as sure as if I was at their table I know that Don 
          is asking her if she likes the snapshot of Maria. I see Sue twitch like 
          a hooked fish. She hasn't been involved in this scene for five minutes 
          and already there are three guys sitting around her who all know what's 
          going down and seem ready to share out the action. Her rather pretty 
          face is looking totally stunned and her bright blue eyes are now trying 
          to avoid all those male eyes staring at her jaunty little tits. Ms Salterly 
          looks to me like a young lady who has suddenly realised that three into 
          one will go and that she's going to be the one. Or maybe she's just 
          wondering to herself if the gang's all here yet. 
        <p> I see Chris lean forward and put another pix in front of her. Another 
          of the girls from the office -- it doesn't matter which one, they're 
          all on the same theme, some intimate hetrosexual activities by a multi-partnered 
          lady. Sue seems absolutely knocked out now -- not so much by what's 
          going on in the picture as by the revelation that behind the respectable 
          facade of the company she works for there seems to be all kinds of secret 
          vice going on. God, but I enjoy all this. Eventually I'm going to have 
          to organise some kind of a meeting place where I can vidotape the target's 
          faces as they get the good word from Chris and the gang. 
        <p> Chris waits until the first shock has subsided and then points out 
          to Sue that this girl also had the same problem that Ms Vincetti had 
          and solved it the same way. Would Sue prefer to go down the same path 
          herself, or would she rather her husband saw the dossier and the photos? 
        <p> Maybe this is the best bit of all, seeing the shaken expression on 
          Ms Salterly's previously snooty features as she tries to figure out 
          what to do. She's had her guilty little secret found out by somebody, 
          she still doesn't know who. Now she's sitting here in a hamburger joint 
          being shown photographs of supposedly respectable female co-workers 
          whoring like harem girls getting their yearly sheikup. It's also being 
          made clear to Ms Salterly that the guys responsible for taking these 
          photos now have another little project in mind. They've picked out another 
          lady to be hog tied and fulsomely worked up and over by one and all. 
          And guess who's just gotten her draft notice? 
        <p> She sits and stares at Chris now, her mouth agape as he explains the 
          rules. About how she has to go where and when she's told, in her sexiest 
          gear, on the clear understanding that when she gets there all the guys 
          can do whatever they like with her. She gasps and almost spills her 
          coke. I can feel the adrenalin pumping into my blood as I wonder if 
          the little blonde will finally give in and agree to become another of 
          Chris's gang-bang groupies? 
        <p> It's soon clear that she's not getting up and walking. One of the 
          guys gets another round of cokes and Ms Salterly is still sitting with 
          the guys when he comes back, sometimes looking out of the window, but 
          more often blushing and staring around the nearby tables to make sure 
          nobody else is hearing what's being said to her. I'll hear it soon enough 
          though because Chris is wearing a wire and he just loves teasing each 
          of the girls at this stage of the game. Usually by showing off two or 
          three pictures of ladies with their mouths full and asking if she thinks 
          she's got as good a technique as any of them? 
        <p> Ah, ah! Now Sue's stopped looking so embarrassed. She's not staring 
          out of the window now, not pretending to show some grace under pressure 
          but looking at the pictures with real interest and almost on the verge 
          of giggles as she shows a lot of interest in what some of the good old 
          girls can do when they try. Especially Senior Manager Vincetti. 
        <p> I'm sure the guys are telling Sue about old vacuum mouth Vincetti 
          and how she could probably swallow a python while it was still wriggling 
          if she was turned on enough. And they've got the snapshots to prove 
          it. Ms Salterly stares at the pictures now without any false embarrassment 
          and doesn't even realise she's moving around so much on her seat. Then 
          Chris really gets her attention as he gives her a piece of paper with 
          the address of the apartment she has to go to and the time she has to 
          be there. 
        <p> Sue picks up the note and then walks out without taking a second glance 
          back at Chris and the other studs. Me, I'm looking at those really sexy 
          legs underneath that tight skirt as I swirl around the last few pieces 
          of almost melted ice in the bottom of my coke container. I'm happy because 
          I know that the next time I see Sue Salterly's legs they'll be stretched 
          wide open and the set of nerve endings between them is all that she'll 
          be caring about by then. I'm happy because I've broken her code. Hers 
          and quite a few others. All that has to happen now is for the guys to 
          put her through her paces and bring me back the shots. 
        <p> Chris barely pauses by my table on the way out: "This time again next 
          week. Should have some nice video for you to admire, Jennifer." 
        <p> "Fine." 
        <p> The guys just grin at me and move on. They still can't get used to 
          the idea of it being a girl who organises these treats for them, especially 
          when I refuse to take part. Still, I don't care what they think and 
          I feel like a goddess when I look at some of the sluts in my company 
          and wonder what they'd say if they knew of the footage I have of them 
          performing on the wild side. And I'm especially looking forward to seeing 
          the tape of Sue Salterly's initiation. Ed always does a hell of a job 
          with the camera and there are extra mikes around the room to pick up 
          every sound 
        <p> When I get the tapes I'll pick out the best vidcaps and transcribe 
          the audio track for everything that was said. It's like lingering over 
          every morsel of a long, delicious meal ...

        <p> Chris: <i>"That'd be cool. Sue, could you maybe bare one shoulder

        <p> Chris: <i>"Mmmmm, yes, that's great. Keep hold of the rope, and that's 
          fine, hey, Ed?"</i> 
        <p> Ed: <i>"Hey, Chris, I guess I can see how come she's got a husband 
          and a boyfriend both happy to look after her. Lucky guys, I guess."</i> 
        <p> Don: <i>"Yeah, but it's our turn to get lucky today. That's right,

        <p> Ed: <i>"Look up, Sue. Look up at where the ropes are tied. Like maybe 
          you're thinking about what's going to happen with the ropes pretty soon."</i> 
        <p> Don: <i>"We can tell you if you're still not sure."</i> 
        <p> Chris: <i>"Don't take any notice of him, Sue, he's always cheeky. 
          You can trust me to look after you. All you've got to tell us is if 
          you've ever played around in front of a camera before."</i> 
        <p> Sue: <i>"No."</i> 
        <p> Chris: <i>"No? How about in front of spectators then? Ever been tied 
          up by a bunch of guys?"</i>

        <p> Don: (laughs) <i>"Don't worry about it, we've had a few shy girls 
          in here before, but they weren't shy about anything when they left."</i> 
        <p> Sue: <i>"Please, put the camera away, please."</i> 
        <p> Chris: <i>"Now, we already explained all that to you, Sue. The guy 
          who caught you having your little fling on the side wants to make sure 
          you've been made to atone for your sins, and we have to show him the 
          proof. He's one of those religious dudes who believes in an eye for 
          an eye and a tooth for a tooth. And maybe getting his rocks off on the 
          side as well. So the camera stays on."</i> 
        <p> Sue: <i>"But who is the son of a bitch?"</i> 
        <p> Chris: <i>"That's for us and him to know but not you, Sue. So forget 
          about him and cuddle up to me so I can take your mind off things."</i>

        <p> Don: <i>"Now that's a fine display of lap dancing. But I think it'd 
          be even better if she had her panties taken off before the next session."</i> 
        <p> Chris: <i>"OK, suppose I bend her over the end of the table? Would 
          one of you two gentlemen help her off with them and leave her butt naked 
          in front of the video? Or would that be too much of a chore?"</i> 
        <p> Don: <i>"No problem at all, Chris. Guess I'd be happy to help out."</i>

          hold onto for us until we're ready to use it where it'll be appreciated."</i> 
        <P> Ed: <i>"I'll have one as well. Hey, what do you think her old man 
          would say if he walked in here now and saw his little darling like this?"</i> 
        <p> Don: <i>"I'd tell the fucker to pull up a chair and after the preview's 
          over we'll get down to the real action. We should send him a few pics 
          of that if we really want to get his attention."</i> 
        <p> Sue: <i>"No, please. You said you wouldn't!"</i> 
        <p> Chris: <i>"Relax. There's no percentage for us in that, not as long

        <p> Sue: <i>"God, no!"</i> 
        <p> Don: <i>"Does that feel good, Chris?"</i> 
        <p> Chris: <i>"Feels fine, my man, just fine. But I wish I was the guy 
          at her office who's got her on a string. I'd put her over her own desk 
          and do this with her."</i>

          tension during the coffee breaks."</i>
