              <p> I was walking past the security checkpoint in my apartment block's 
          underground car park when I was stopped by the guard inside the cubicle. 
          In fact he'd come out the cubicle when he saw me approaching, obviously 
          wanting to say something. I knew most of the guards by name, but not 
          this one. He'd only been around in the last couple of weeks. Not at 
          all bad looking I'd thought, but that was all the notice I'd ever taken 
          of him. 
        <p> "Can you spare a minute, Ms Kubota?" 
        <p> "Sure. What's the problem?" 
        <p> "Not really a problem. Not yet, anyway. I just wanted to let you know 
          that I've got a copy of a tape from the security camera down here in 
          the car park. A tape from last Wednesday night in fact -- just after 
          midnight." 
        <p> He was grinning like a high school kid telling a dirty story but I 
          had no idea what the joke was. 
        <p> "What about it?" 
        <p> "Ah, the thing is, the tape shows you getting out of your car with 
          a male friend and giving him a very passionate kiss before you went 
          off hand in hand to the elevator." 
        <p> "What the hell has that got to do with you?" 
        <p> Now the smile was bigger than ever: "It's got nothing at all to do 
          with me. But Mr Wang might think it has a hell of a lot to do with him." 
        <p> This was nasty. If I was reading it right it could be very nasty. 
        <p> "Who's Mr Wang?" 
        <p> "You don't know Mr Wang, Ms Kubota? That's a surprise, considering 
          he usually spends a couple of evenings here each week, and every time 
          he comes here he stays in your apartment. Perhaps you never noticed 
          him, or perhaps you thought he was the cleaner. But it would be odd 
          that you don't know he owns the apartment you're living in. Why, I bet 
          you didn't even know that he was in Chicago on a business trip on Wednesday 
          night. I know it though, because I checked up on Thursday by phoning 
          his office." 
        <p> The guy looked so young that I thought I might be able to bluff things 
          out. 
        <p> "What's your name?" 
        <p> "Danny Collins. Very pleased to meet you, Ms Kubota." 
        <p> "Don't give me your crap. If I reported this conversation you'd be 
          out on the street tomorrow looking for a job." 
        <p> "I surely would. But if I showed a copy of the tape to Mr Wang maybe 
          he'd give me a job and you'd certainly be out on the street looking 
          for somewhere to live. Check, Ms Kubota?" 
        <p> Not check, but checkmate. If he did have a tape he claimed he did. 
          One thing was for sure, I certainly had been fool enough to kiss Ray 
          here in the car park on Wednesday night, and somebody must have seen 
          us. Since no one had been in sight it was probably true the only way 
          this little snot knew about it was because of the building surveillance 
          system. 
        <p> Which in turn meant that he probably did have a tape. And if Ti saw 
          it he was going to get upset -- not angry, just upset over a business 
          deal where he was getting short changed. And when Ti had a business 
          deal go sour on him he terminated it straight away. I'd last just as 
          long as it took me to pack my bags, and Ti would have no trouble at 
          all in finding another girl to help me carry them out as long as she 
          could move in afterwards to take my place. 
        <p> Maybe I could threaten to tell Mrs Wang? Or maybe not. Prominent Chinese 
          businessmen never break the law but they usually have a third cousin 
          six times removed living on the other side of the city who has a buddy 
          who knows a guy who's strong with the local triad. Some money would 
          move from a Singapore bank to a Hong Kong bank and one way or another 
          I'd be persuaded to shut up. No, threatening Ti was not a good idea. 
          Nor was trying to threaten this nasty little nosey parker -- all he 
          stood to lose was in the fight was his crummy guard's job: me, I'd go 
          instantly from high rise living to becoming low life. 
        <p> "I think we're going to have to talk about this," I said. 
        <p> "That's the way I see it too, Ms Kubota. My shift ends at eleven. 
          I'll come up then." 
        <p> "OK. But don't bring your gun or I might be tempted to show you how 
          much I don't want to see you." 
        <p> "My pistol's only a .38 but I've got a much bigger caliber weapon 
          than that -- and I've always got it ready and loaded with me." 
        <p> "The way you're behaving, Mr Collins, I wouldn't count on keeping 
          it forever." 
        <p> He grinned, totally unworried. I couldn't hurt him and he knew it. 
        <p> "See you tonight, Ms Kubota. Keep things warm for me." 
        <p> <a href="Security/Secimages/z338.jpg"> 
        <img align="left" WIDTH = "100" HEIGHT = "136" hspace="10"  border="0" src="Security/thumbs/z338_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Security/Secimages/z338.jpg"></a> 
        <p> The door bell sounded at eleven ten and when I opened it there was 
          no surprise at all about who was standing there, a big grin all over 
          his shit eating face. 
        <p> "Well, hello, Ms Kubota. Here I am coming off duty and there you are 
          dressed to go on duty. But surely you've got something a bit sexier 
          in the way of lingerie for Mr Wang's visits? Or do you reserve the frilly 
          knickers for the Wednesday night specials?" 
        <p> "Did anybody ever tell you your mouth is bigger than the Lincoln tunnel?" 
        <p> He was totally cool: "There are a lot of rude answers I could make 
          to that, Ms Kubota, but let's just say you're not making me happy the 
          way you would be if you were smart. How about inviting me into your 
          apartment while you've still got an apartment to invite anybody into?" 
        <p> He had me over a barrel and he knew it. 
        <p> "Alright, come in." I stepped aside and he strolled in as though he 
          owned the place himself. The guy had more front than the city public 
          library. 
        <p> "Not bad, not bad at all. And all paid for by pulling on Mr Wang's 
          yang. Nice work I guess, though I wouldn't fancy it myself. Mind you, 
          I think that on balance I'd prefer Mr Wang to the specimen you brought 
          home on Wednesday. Even a nymphomaniac should know where to join the 
          line." 
        <p> "I'm not a nymphomaniac -- or a blackmailer, either, come to think 
          of it." 
        <p> "If you say so. From what I've heard, if all the guys who've been 
          in here to screw you were put together in the elevator, it'd be way 
          too heavy to get off the ground floor. And the story is that none of 
          them ever came back. One ride on Kelly Kubota's subway and they never 
          returned. Weren't any of them good enough, or wouldn't any of them pay 
          to come back for a second turn?" 
        <p> "You! ... " I had to bite back the words I wanted to spit out. "Have 
          you got anything to say that's worth my time listening to?" 
        <p> He undid his neck tie, took it off and threw it over the back of a 
          chair, then unbuttoned his shirt. "I've got news for you, Kelly. You 
          don't have anymore time -- it all belongs to me now. Except for Mr Wang's, 
          maybe." 
        <p> "I don't think so. Ti Wang is an important man, but you're a nobody." 
        <p> Danny unclipped the big metal torch on his belt, walked over to me 
          and prodded me in the stomach with it. "Step backwards into your bedroom 
          and sit your big ass down on the bed, or I might loose my temper with 
          your big mouth." 
        <p> <a href="Security/Secimages/guepx.jpg"> 
        <img align="right" WIDTH = "100" HEIGHT = "75" hspace="10"  border="0" src="Security/thumbs/guepx_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Security/Secimages/guepx.jpg"></a> 
        <p> As soon as I was on my bed he sat down beside me and pushed the torch 
          up underneath my chin. 
        <p> "Do I get an apology for what you just said, or do I send a Fed-Ex 
          parcel with a video tape inside it around to your very important friend, 
          Mr Wang?" 
        <p> There was no place to go but down. 
        <p> "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that, Danny. It's just that you're 
          frightening me and I'm getting nervous. I didn't mean anything by it." 
        <p> "That's better - that's what I came to hear. So now we'll start again, 
          right?" 
        <p> "Right." 
        <p> The torch dropped from my chin, slipped along my throat, lower and 
          lower, until it reached the elastic band at the top of my night dress. 
          The weight of the warm metal rested on it, pulling down the material 
          and exposing the tops of my breasts. 
        <p> <a href="Security/Secimages/bffb.jpg"> 
        <img align="left" WIDTH = "100" HEIGHT = "75" hspace="10"  border="0" src="Security/thumbs/bffb_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Security/Secimages/bffb.jpg"></a> 
        <p> Danny snickered as he enjoyed the view: "That's a pretty good looking 
          set you've got there, Kelly. I thought they'd be a sticker on them somewhere 
          though -- <i>handle with care</i>, maybe. Or at least some autographs 
          and visitors' comments." 
        <p> "Aw, come on, Danny. I'm trying to be nice. Why do you have to make 
          things so difficult between us?" 
        <p> He looked up and grinned at me. "Maybe if you let me have a good clear 
          look at these beauties I'd shut up for a while." 
        <p> "OK. Why don't you lie down." 
        <p> He took off his jacket and shirt, then stretched out on the bed. I 
          sat down beside him. 
        <p> "Do you often pull strokes like this, Danny?" 
        <p> "What do you mean?" 
        <p> "I'm talking about blackmailing tenants with things you see on the 
          security cameras." 
        <p> <a href="Security/Secimages/en79.jpg"> 
        <img align="right" WIDTH = "100" HEIGHT = "75" hspace="10"  border="0" src="Security/thumbs/en79_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Security/Secimages/en79.jpg"></a> 
        <p> He smirked as he pulled down one of my nightdress straps. "If you 
          think you're being blackmailed, you should hear about some of the things 
          I've seen other people doing around here. They've got no brains at all, 
          some of them." 
        <p> "Like me, you mean?" 
        <p> "You're not stupid, you're just a slut." 
        <p> God, this creep pissed me. "Is that the best way you can think of 
          to get a girl to come onto you, Danny? By saying something like that?" 
        <p> "OK, my turn to say sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Now, let's 
          get this night dress all the way down." 
        <p> His hands pulled off my shoulder straps and dropped the night dress 
          around my waist. Now I had nothing on above my waist except my bra and 
          he looked at me carefully, his eyes shifting from side to side. 
        <p> <a href="Security/Secimages/22d9x.jpg"> 
        <img align="left" WIDTH = "100" HEIGHT = "75" hspace="10"  border="0" src="Security/thumbs/22d9x_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Security/Secimages/22d9x.jpg"></a> 
        <p> "Tell you what, Kelly, how about I call you a professional dealer 
          in market driven female companionship? Does that sound better?" 
        <p> "You seem like a kind of an unusual guy to be a security guard, Danny." 
        <p> "Ah, that's because I'm really a writer. I only do the security guard 
          work to make survival money. And because it gives me a chance sometimes 
          to get into a situation like this to suck people dry." 
        <p> My stomach churned over with bile: "So you are a blackmailer, after 
          all." 
        <p> He sat up, reached around behind my back and unhooked the bra. 
        <p> "Sure, I'm a blackmailer, but not for money. That's not a writer's 
          currency. I want to know about you, everything about you. Your life, 
          your lovers, your experiences, what you've learnt, what you've been 
          told -- most importantly, what you feel. That's what I mean by sucking 
          people dry. A good writer is a vampire: we swallow your life's blood 
          and spit out it as ink on pages." 
        <p> <a href="Security/Secimages/hs59x.jpg"> 
        <img align="right" WIDTH = "100" HEIGHT = "75" hspace="10"  border="0" src="Security/thumbs/hs59x_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Security/Secimages/hs59x.jpg"></a> 
        <p> "That's the reason you're taking my bra off, is it? So you can talk 
          to me?" 
        <p> "No, it's because I'm going to fuck you. After that we talk." 
        <p> "It sounds as if being a writer is a good job -- for a guy, anyway." 
        <p> Danny laughed: "There's no such thing as good and bad for us. That's 
          a real life thing -- we're only the reflections in a mirror. Writers 
          don't really exist: we're just figments of our own imagination." 
        <p> He was weird -- really weird. 
        <p> "So you don't believe you're real, right?" 
        <p> "Oh, we play our roles in the story. The difference between us and 
          everybody else is that we know it's only a story and we know when the 
          time has come to write <i>'The End'</i> on the bottom of the page. Then 
          we do a Hemingway, because one thing that can really spoil a good story 
          is leaving a burnt out character in it with nothing left to say." 
        <p> Like I said, weird. I unzipped his pants and opened them. 
        <p> "So what happened to this guy Hemingway?" 
        <p> "He shot himself." 
        <p> <a href="Security/Secimages/udd6x.jpg"> 
        <img align="left" WIDTH = "100" HEIGHT = "75" hspace="10"  border="0" src="Security/thumbs/udd6x_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Security/Secimages/udd6x.jpg"></a> 
        <p> I squeezed his big stiff cock between my fingers and rubbed it up 
          and down. Danny sighed with pleasure. 
        <p> "Are you quite sure this isn't really happening?" I asked him. 
        <p> "Well, I guess it feels as if it's happening. Do it again and I'll 
          try to make my mind up about it." 
        <p> "OK, concentrate very hard and see if you can spot the difference 
          between shooting yourself and having somebody else shoot you off." 
        <p> "You don't believe in metaphysics do you, Kelly? If I'm not sure I'm 
          really here, how do you know I'm here?" 
        <p> "Well, if you're not here, I hope to hell nobody is taping this because 
          I'd look very fucking stupid doing it on my own." 
        <p> "Yeah, I suppose. Tell you what, why don't you reassure both of by 
          us by giving my cock a little lick?" 
        <p> "I'd better do something, Danny. You're the most insecure security 
          man I've ever met." 
        <p> <a href="Security/Secimages/crowx.jpg"> 
        <img align="right" WIDTH = "100" HEIGHT = "75" hspace="10"  border="0" src="Security/thumbs/crowx_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Security/Secimages/crowx.jpg"></a> 
        <p> I bent over and dabbed the top of his cock with my tongue. If Danny 
          was telling the truth about not wanting any money things weren't so 
          bad at all. All I had to do was to let him screw me and talk to him 
          for a while. In fact he sounded like the sort of guy who had a real 
          problem finding anybody to listen to him. His hand ran along my leg 
          as he gave out a little groan of pleasure. 
        <p> "What do you think, Danny, am I here after all?" 
        <p> "If you're not, I'm having a real cool dream. How about hauling my 
          pants off for me?" 
        <p> "OK." 
        <p> I knelt down at the side of the bed, unlaced his shoes, took them 
          off and then his socks. Nice and slowly, of course. 
        <p> "If you want to write something about me, Danny, remember this part. 
          This is what guys pay for. The sex they can get at home, it's the male 
          master and obedient slave girl routine they really want." 
        <p> "So you get paid for doing what you're told?" 
        <p> "Don't we all?" 
        <p> I put one knee on top of the bed and began to slide his pants along 
          his legs. Danny's face was full of mischief: "Testing, testing, testing 
          -- suck my cock, slave girl." 
        <p> I did as he wanted, taking it deep into my mouth and working on it 
          with my lips: "Wheee ... " Danny sighed. Then I lifted my head up again 
          and resumed the job of taking off my pants. He didn't stop me again, 
          not even when I took time to drape them carefully across the back of 
          a chair. His eyes were fastened on me though as I slipped off my nightdress 
          and put it on the chair as well. Then I stepped slowly back to the bed 
          and snapped the waistband of my panties. 
        <p> "Do you want to help me out of these, Danny?" 
        <p> "No way. The master doesn't do any of the work. You sit at the end 
          of the bed and I'll watch you taking them off for me." 
        <p> <a href="Security/Secimages/fmy7x.jpg"> 
        <img align="left" WIDTH = "100" HEIGHT = "75" hspace="10"  border="0" src="Security/thumbs/fmy7x_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Security/Secimages/fmy7x.jpg"></a> 
        <p> I leaned back against the pillows with my knees up in front of me 
          and began to wriggle out of my panties. "Hey, Danny are there any other 
          women in this block you've persuaded into doing this for you?" 
        <p> His fingers gently stroked the length of his cock: "You wouldn't believe 
          the inspiration I've found in this building. More than I'll ever be 
          able to write down, I guess." 
        <p> "So all of us naughty girls are going to end up in a book?" 
        <p> "Screw writing a book, I want to make some real money. I'm writing 
          a film script." 
        <p> "Yeah -- well I guess this next scene won't get past the censor." 
        <p> Danny laughed: "What scene's that?" 
        <p> "The one where we switch roles and I suck you dry." 
        <p> "Maybe we can't film it but it certainly sounds like good background 
          experience." 
        <p> <a href="Security/Secimages/caw5x.jpg"> 
        <img align="right" WIDTH = "100" HEIGHT = "75" hspace="10"  border="0" src="Security/thumbs/caw5x_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Security/Secimages/caw5x.jpg"></a> 
        <p> I moved down the bed and sat cross legged in the middle of it. Danny 
          knelt down in front of me. For a thin guy he had a hell of a big boner, 
          with a smear of pre-come already seeping out of the slit. I licked my 
          fingers and slowly rubbed the mixture of saliva and spunk into the smooth 
          skin. 
        <p> "Is this the peace pipe I have to smoke, Danny?" 
        <p> "You don't have to make it smoke, honey. Just make it very warm -- 
          and wet." 
        <p> "And then you're going to fuck me with it?" 
        <p> "I guess it's the best thing I've got for the job." 
        <p> "You want to know something funny, Danny? When Ray was kissing me 
          in the car park I thought nobody was around. I really wanted him to 
          make me kneel down on the front seats and do me doggy style with my 
          skirt up and my panties down. It would have been a real thrill -- but 
          I guess it would have been a big one for you as well if we'd done it 
          then and there in front of the camera." 
        <p> "Don't worry, you haven't missed your chance. Only it'll be you with 
          bent over the chair in the security cubicle. Or maybe it'll be in the 
          locker room with a couple of the other guys watching. Start blowing 
          me while I think about it."

        <p> "Well, while you're thinking about it, just remember that I'm your 
          slave girl now. Anything you want me to do, I have to do it." 
        <p> He was thinking about it alright. He was twitching with excitement 
          even before I started giving him his blow job. It's just so easy to 
          turn a guy on if he's got some imagination. Grabbing them by the cock 
          is easy, grabbing their mind often isn't, not unless there's something 
          in there to work with already. 
        <p> "I'll find something for you to do, Kelly, count on it. I'll find 
          a way of putting your big fat ass out on the edge, even if I have to 
          screw you in the middle of Central Park." 
        <p> That was what I wanted to hear. I wanted him strutting his feathers 
          and the king of the world in his own mind. As long as I was getting 
          him hot and bothered at every session he wouldn't want to spoil the 
          deal by telling tales to Ti or hitting me for money. Of course that 
          wouldn't last for ever but right now I needed some time to try to think 
          a way through the situation, which was why I was really sucking up to 
          him. And in a way I'd bet he'd never been sucked before. 
        <p> The thing was, he was a weirdo, and weirdos are --- well, weird. From 
          what I'd heard him say so far, he might wake up one morning and decide 
          to take his laptop on a Greyhound to Hollywood or Hindustan, or anywhere, 
          and that would be the end of this problem. I could hope, anyway. 
        <p> "On your back, slut. It's time for your treat."

        <p> I stretched out on the bed and Danny hooked my left leg over his shoulder, 
          then began rubbing the head of his cock up and down my cunt lips. 
        <p> "This is what you want, isn't it, you cock sucking slut bitch!" 
        <p> He could say what he liked, I've already heard everything, but I pretended 
          to be upset and ashamed. Yet although I looked away from his face I 
          was lifting my hips up and rubbing back against his cock. 
        <p> "Danny, don't say those things." 
        <p> "Tell me you want my cock shoved up your cunt -- tell me!" 
        <p> "Oh sweet Jesus, Danny, of course I want it. It's the biggest one 
          I've ever felt. You're driving me mad doing this." 
        <p> "Look at me, then! Look at me, you little fat bitch and tell me you 
          want fucking!" 
        <p> "Alright -- alright!" 
        <p> I turned my head and looked into his glittering eyes: "Fuck me, please, 
          Danny, fuck me!" 
        <p> <a href="Security/Secimages/armyx.jpg"> 
        <img align="left" WIDTH = "100" HEIGHT = "75" hspace="10"  border="0" src="Security/thumbs/armyx_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Security/Secimages/armyx.jpg"></a> 
        <p> "OK, seeing as you're asking so nicely, here comes the first inch, 
          slut." 
        <p> There was no difficulty at all in appearing happy about having him 
          sliding into me. I enjoy a good fuck as much as the next six girls and 
          skinny guys with big cocks are my kind of meat. You can kind of slide 
          them in closer and deeper. 
        <p> "How do you like that, slut?" 
        <p> "God, God, it's wonderful," I moaned softly. 
        <p> I'd let Danny play the boss man for the first session and then show 
          him some of my tricks the second time around - after I'd finished being 
          so shy about having a stranger fuck me. 
        <p> Basically, keeping men happy is like running a dogs' home. They all 
          want to be wild animals but they all want to be patted on the head as 
          well, and most of them are more trouble than they're worth in a house. 
          Feed them, clean up after them and all you get is barked at. Still, 
          they do have their uses, if you happen to be in the mood. And Danny 
          had certainly gotten me into the mood to have him inside me. 
        <p> <a href="Security/Secimages/cfaxx.jpg">

        <p> "Fuck me, you bastard, fuck me!" I squealed as he kept ramming that 
          monster shaft of his in and out of my slit. 
        <p> "You like this, slut-fucker?" 
        <p> "Jesus, you must have another guy's share of cock as well as your 
          own! Oh, God!" 
        <p> Like I say, you have to keep patting them on the head. But this time 
          anyway I wasn't have to pretend about anything. Danny might be a sniveling 
          little weirdo but he sure had a lot of ability at screwing -- and a 
          cock to match. I was hanging onto the pillow and coming like Niagara 
          Falls. It beats a pill any time for giving a girl a relaxed night's 
          sleep. Good for the conscience as well: however much of a bitch you 
          might have been during the day, at least you know you've ended up making 
          one guy very happy. 
        <p> "You ready to take it all now, slut bitch?" 
        <p> "Give it to me, Danny! All the way, all the way! Please!" 
        <p> <a href="Security/Secimages/datax.jpg"> 
        <img align="left" WIDTH = "100" HEIGHT = "75" hspace="10"  border="0" src="Security/thumbs/datax_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Security/Secimages/datax.jpg"></a> 
        <p> I felt little bubbles of air blowing out of my mouth in satisfied 
          sobs as he plunged into me with the energy of a pile driver crew on 
          double yardage bonus. Mother earth was shaking and quivering all around 
          the drilling site, and then the earthquake started. 
        <p> I'm not shy about coming. Not shy at all. When Kelly creams herself 
          any -- or everybody -- else who happens to be in the same apartment 
          knows all about it. A few times I've been videotaped during the final 
          countdown, and every time the biggest embarrassment afterwards has been 
          having to listen to the noises I make. As one of my less endearing lovers 
          remarked, it usually sounds like a cow falling over a cliff. And as 
          I went ballistic this time Danny was still threshing away inside me 
          as if he was connected to a short circuit. 
        <p> "You slut bitch, this if for you!" 
        <p> <a href="Security/Secimages/clatx.jpg"> 
        <img align="right" WIDTH = "100" HEIGHT = "75" hspace="10"  border="0" src="Security/thumbs/clatx_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Security/Secimages/clatx.jpg"></a> 
        <p> One second he was there, inside me, a second later he wasn't and his 
          come was splashing across my belly in long sticky threads. Then he slumped 
          forward, his hands on either side of my shoulders as I ruffled his hair. 
        <p> "Hey, Danny, if you write as well as you fuck you should be working 
          up some contacts in LA. How about letting me take a look at your script?" 
        <p> "No problem. But I don't have any contacts out West -- not yet." 
        <p> My fingers gently ran along his jaw line: "If I went with you, maybe 
          I could find some. After you've made me a legal partner." 
        <p> "Yeah? What sort of legal partnership have you got in mind? 
        <p> I told him.
