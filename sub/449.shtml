              <p>By Duncan </p>
              <p>I have this dream that I am in my office. I was supposed to have 
                the day off, but as usual, I and the rest of my office was called 
                in. However, I have promised to take you to the symphony, so you 
                know that I'll have the problem fixed in time. I know how much 
                you love to feel the music thrumming through your body. I know 
                how listening to the Pops gets me all wound up.</p>
              <p>I am bent over my keyboard, when a sudden silence causes me to 
                look up. All eyes in the room beyond are turned toward the entrance, 
                which I can't see from my desk. Next, I hear slow measured taps 
                of heels on hardwood. A large grin spreads across my face as I 
                check my watch. Yep, it's time! I hear the taps getting louder 
                until your standing in front of my open office door. My eyes run 
                approvingly over your figure as I get up to greet you.</p>
              <p>You lean against the doorjamb in your new dress. It is a full 
                length form-filling white sequined gown. The bodice is heart shaped 
                and rides low upon your breasts, leaving my co-workers with no 
                doubt about the wealth of treasure hidden underneath. Around your 
                throat is a jeweled collar with sparkling straps that appear to 
                be holding your dress up. Your hair is piled sensuously atop your 
                head in a sleek twist.</p>
              <p>&quot;Hello Lover,&quot; you purr.</p>
              <p>I walk around my desk and you turn slightly to follow me with 
                your eyes. The movement directs my attention to your legs and 
                I notice for the first time that the dress is slit up to the hips 
                on both sides, exposing your long legs and three-inch heels to 
                my admiring gaze. As I near you, you bring forward the garment 
                bag dangling from one manicured finger. Reaching for it, I slide 
                my other hand around your body to pull you close for a kiss. Your 
                arms eagerly encircle me and you lean into me. I raise my eyebrow 
                when my hand encounters nothing but the bare skin of your back. 
                Hooking the garment bag over the door, I turn you around let out 
                a low wolf-whistle. It is quite obvious that the jeweled collar 
                IS the only thing holding the dress up. There is no back at all! 
                The dress meets low on the curve of your bottom, and a quick stroke 
                of my finger assures you that there is no room for pesky underwear 
                underneath.</p>
              <p>The men of my office move closer, obviously angling for an introduction, 
                but you ignore them. I am the object of your adoration! I pull 
                you into my office, lowering the blinds and shutting the door 
                behind us. I allow my curious hands to slide up your stocking-clad 
                thighs and cup your naked ass through the slits on the sides of 
                the gown.</p>
              <p>&quot;Oh baby!&quot; I groan, &quot;We'll never make it to the 
                symphony now!&quot;</p>
              <p>You chuckle low in your throat. &quot;Yes, we will, Duncan. You 
                promised!&quot;</p>
              <p>I sign, letting my hands drop from your firm flesh, and reach 
                for the garment bag.</p>
              <p>The tux was a present from you. It is tailor-made and fits like 
                a glove. Within minutes I look like I just stepped off the pages 
                of GQ. You slink over to me (a dress like this requires that you 
                slink, not walk) and kiss me passionately. My teasing fingers 
                trace the line of the dress and you step back. As I open the door 
                to the office, you slip your arm through mine. Just as you suspect, 
                my co-workers are not far from the door-no doubt listening for 
                something juicy. For a moment, you are tempted to oblige them, 
                until you see the stampede of women coming our way! You tighten 
                your possessive hold on my arm.</p>
              <p>My female co-workers have seen me dressed in a variety of ways, 
                but never like this. That tux does things to my form that should 
                be illegal in all fifty states! Where we could have ignored my 
                fellow males, the addition of ladies clamoring for my attention 
                brings out my gentlemanly instincts. You're caught trying to make 
                polite small talk with women who can't take their eyes off me 
                long enough to look at you! Smiling tightly, you slide your arm 
                around my back and lean closer. You are trying not to look like 
                the jealous witch we both secretly know you are.</p>
              <p>I make the introductions and you try not to glare at the pretty 
                Christy I have lunch with occasionally her eyes laugh at you and 
                I knowingly kiss your ear. You remind me of our tickets and we 
                leave both conscious of the longing eyes following us.</p>
              <p>The symphony was an electrifying experience. In our private box, 
                no one noticed you stroking my delicious hard-on through my slacks. 
                Hopefully, they were equally oblivious that my encircling arm 
                ends with my hand under your bodice, caressing your hard nipples. 
                We enjoy the music, but we enjoy the rising anticipation and each 
                other more!</p>
              <p>We must have broken several land speed records getting home! 
                We didn't even make it into the bedroom! We are in the dining 
                room when I finally figure out the single clasp of the jeweled 
                collar and watch with appreciation as the gown slithers down your 
                humming body. My jacket and studs fly across the room and your 
                eager hands are struggling with my zipper. I laugh and push your 
                fumbling hands away. I deftly undo them and they pool down around 
                my ankles. You quickly drop down on your knees in front of me 
                and pull off my shoes. I kick them free of my remaining clothes.</p>
              <p>I, as usual, have other plans. I am too excited for a mere suck-off. 
                I want to feel your pulsating passage clinching around me. I pull 
                on your hair until you stand up. Regretfully, you let my long, 
                hot, hard, extremely think staff slide out of your mouth. I turn 
                you around and push. Off balance on your high heels, you fall 
                over the dinner table. I step behind you and, with no further 
                ado, slam onto you. Your breast rubs against the unyielding table.</p>
              <p>&quot;Duncan!&quot; You scream &quot;Duncan! DUNCAN! OH MY GOD!&quot;</p>
              <p>You arch your back and lift your hips against my hands, taking 
                me deeper into you with each massive thrust. You grab the sides 
                of the table and push back hard against me until you can feel 
                my mighty tool touch your hungry womb! I lean forward nipping 
                at the sexy skin of your back that has been teasing me all night. 
                You explode around me, screaming! You cum and cum and cum!!!!</p>
              <p>I keep pounding into you over and over again. WILL I NEVER CUM?!!? 
                In. Out. Harder. Deeper. Longer than ever before. I thrust into 
                you like I'm never going to stop! You cum again. Finally, you 
                feel me jerk out of rhythm and you know I am ready. You push hard 
                against me and I lift you clear off your feet! My own back is 
                arched with tension and you feel me hit your womb like a jackhammer! 
                I groan heavily.</p>
              <p>&quot;MY SWEET LOVE!!&quot; I cry.</p>
              <p>You are so turned on that just the sound of my horse voice calling 
                out to you sends you over one last, almost painful time. I collapse 
                over your back, squashing you against the table. We are both breathing 
                too hard to care.</p>
              <p>&quot;God Duncan! I'm going to make you take me to the symphony 
                more often!&quot;</p>
              <p>I laugh weakly and slowly stand up. You try to follow my example, 
                but your legs are shaking too hard to hold your weight. I laugh 
                harder this time and sweep you up in my arms. Once there you find 
                I am almost as spent as you are. I stagger into the bedroom and 
                dump you unceremoniously onto the bed. You bounce and roll across 
                the sheet, barely stopped from going over the edge by the dip 
                of the mattress as I fall in after you. You have just enough energy 
                to kick off your heels before rolling over to my side and pillowing 
                your breast against my ribs. You kiss my nipples as you slip into 
                dreamland.</p>
