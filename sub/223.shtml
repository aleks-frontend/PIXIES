We just had to meet and touch eachother soon. I got my plane ticket, and was going to spend 3 weeks with my love. I couldn't wait...<br> So nervous the night before I couldn't sleep. Making sure everything was packed and ready, I waited for the clock to read 9am so I could leave for the airport. The flight was on time, and I was getting more nervous as the plane was driving up to the hanger.<br> Taking a deep breath, I stood up and grabbed my carry on bag and jacket. <br> Letting most of the others off first, I slowly walked up the long hallway. As I go through the door, our eyes meet and time stands still. A smile comes over both of our faces and we slowly walk towards eachother. Hi beautiful, he says to me, making me blush..putting his hand along side of my face and softly kissing my lips. The electricity between us was unbelievable. It was like 1000 volts rushed through my body, my legs got week and I started shaking. He noticed and put his arms around me to keep me from falling... Holding me so tight, he whispered in my ear, are you ok?? I couldn't speak, I slowly nodded yes and softly moaned, mmmmmmmmmm, squeezing him a little tighter...<br> He took the bag out of my hand and pulled back enough to look into my eyes... we stared at eachother for a long time, just smiling, then he said lets get your suitcase and get out of here. Keeping his arm around my waste we slowly walk to baggage claim...<br> I couldn't believe I was there, that we were finally together. I could touch him, feel his arms around me. I was in heaven, and I knew I was never going to let him go.<br> We got my suitcase and headed for the car. He opened the trunk and put the bags in, then opened my door for me. But before I would sit inside, he gently pulled me to him, kissing me so deeply it took my breath away. I started shaking all over again. He ran his hands down my back and on my ass, pulling me closer, squeezing my cheeks. I could feel him throbbing, and it sent charges through my body. We slowly started grinding on eachother and breathing harder, turning us both on even more. Just then someone drove by us and yelled &quot;Get a room.&quot;. We both jumped and giggled a little. I turned to sit in the car and he bent over and kissed me softly, then closed the door. Walking around to get in himself, I could see him walking a little funny in the mirror and I smiled to myself...<br> The hotel wasn't far, as Dave shut the car off he looked at me, touching my face, whispered, I love you Vikki, I am so happy you are here with me. Then we kissed, letting our tongues play with eachother, setting us both off again... slowly pulling away from a very long kiss, I opened my eyes and whispered lets go inside...<br> He opened my door for me and took my hand to help me up... We walked hand in hand to the room and he asked me to wait a minute as he opened the door and put the bags just inside, then turned and gently picked me up, kissing me again and carried me into the room. Gently putting me down on the bed.<br> Dave slowly sat down next to me, still kissing me deeply and both of us running our hands all over eachother. Our breathing was getting harder and faster, as we slowly pulled away from kissing. Looking into eachothers eyes, we tried to catch our breath....<br> Looking at eachother for a long time, I started to get up and he asked me where I was going, I smiled and said I will be right back. Touching the side of his face. I grabbed my bag and moved it to the stand in the closet and opened it up. Looking for the birthday present that I had gotten for him. I found it and pulled it out, without showing him and walked into the bathroom closing the door behind me. I slowly took off my close and put on this velvet short nighty, royal blue, Dave's favorite color, checking in the mirror to see how it looked. I was pleased, and I knew he would be too. I slowly opened the door and walked out, by the expression on Dave's face I knew he loved it. His bottom lip hit the floor and his eyes almost popped out. I never saw anyone jump up so fast and kneel before me. OOh baby, was all he could say. Grabbing my hands and kissing them. I whispered, Happy Birthday my love.<br> Dave slowly ran his hands across the material, and softly moaned, mmmmmmmm very nice... He stood up and pulled me close to him, kissing my face and neck. He slowly moved me back over to the bed and sat me down. He took off his shirt and slipped his shoes off, then we both reached for his belt at the same time, looking at eachother and smiling. He moved his hand away and let me do it.<br> I unbuckled and unzipped his pants and let them fall to his ankles, he stepped out of them and grabbed my hands before I could grab his underwear. I looked up and him and he slowly laid me down climbing on top of me. Kissing me softly on the lips then down my chest through the mesh scrolled top that barley covered them...<br> My nipples grew harder and poked through the material, as he gently grabbed then with his teeth.. making me moan and arch my back..Ooooooooh David. slowly working his way down my belly, he kept moving my nighty up with his teeth, untill it was above my belly button. kissing it and slowly licking all around it, sending shivers down my spine.. hearing me breathing hard and feeling me shake under him was turning him on so much, also the sight of my pussy clean shaven was almost more than he could take.. He bent my legs up and buried his face in my pussy. Licking me all over. Spreading my lips with his fingers, he started to fuck me with his tongue, OOOooooooh yesssssssssss I moaned and spread my legs farther apart. His finger started to rub my clit as his tongue kept going in and out of my pussy, OOooooooh Dave, Ooh baby, my whole body shaking wildly and my pussy grabbing his tongue, I grabbed a hold of his hair with both hands and bucked against his face, cumming all down his chin. As he tried to lick and suck up all my love juices. I slowly let go of his hair... trying to catch my breath, I gently pulled his hair again to get him to come up to me. I couldn't speak. One long last lick and he slowly kissed his way back up to me and kissed me deeply, letting me taste myself on his tongue... We lay there holding eachother for while, then I slowly got up on my knees and gently pushed Dave down on his back... I kissed my way down his neck and chest. licking and sucking on each nipple, hearing him breath harder and softly moan my name, Ooh Vikki... running my tongue down his belly as I slowly wiggle down his body, also pulling his underwear down at the same time... I run my nails down his chest and watch him shiver, then slowly run my tongue around the base of his cock. licking his balls and gently sucking them into my mouth. Dave reaches down and grabs my hair, moving me to were he wants me, I let go of his balls and take long slow licks up and down the shaft. OOOOOooooooh Vikki yesssssssss he moans... Then I lick around the head and slowly close my lips on it... gently squeezing and licking, as Dave slowly guides my head up and down his shaft. moving his hips up as he pushes my head down. Squeezing the base of his cock, with my lips, every time I go down.<br> Soon he is on the edge, I can hear him breathing very hard.<br> Then I hear him whisper, I want to cum in your pussy... He slowly pulls me off his cock and I wiggle up his body. Putting my legs on each side of his hips, he grabs his cock and starts rubbing it up and down my slit, getting it all wet. Then slowly pushes the head inside. OOOOOooooohDavid, I almost scream, It has been a very long time for me and he is so big. stretching my pussy to its limits. He slowly grabs my hips and pushes them down. Pushing his cock deeper inside me. Both of us moaning. OOOooooh baby..<br> All the way inside me, I stop for a minute to get use to his size. I can feel him throbbing inside me, my pussy twitching around him, he whispers, I can't hold much longer baby... I sit up and grind down on his cock. OOOoooooh yessssssssssssss. sending us both over the edge. OOOooooooh Vikki, OOooH Dave.. I collapse on his chest, both of us trying to catch our breaths. Hearts pounding, holding eachother so tight, whisper, I love you. and we fall asleep in eachothers arms... </p> <p><br> Any comments send to Vzmyst@hotmail.com<b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> </font> </b></p> <!-- #EndEditable --></td>
