                          <td colspan="2" width="100%"> <!-- #BeginEditable "story" --> <p>I had been thinking about him all day...it had been years since I had seen him. Suddenly, there it was....out of nowhere....a package on the doorstep. And the phone call....his voice was deep and resonant, just like I had remembered....it send delicious little shivers up my spine. &quot;Wear what is in the box, and nothing more&quot;, he had said. I protested weakly....&quot;But....a blindfold? ....How will I see your face?&quot;, I asked. &quot;Just do it&quot;, came his short reply, and he hung up the phone. I stood there staring at the receiver for a moment.........then, realizing he would be arriving in an hour, I dashed off to the shower. I wanted everything to be perfect. <br> Exactly one hour later I found myself stumbling to answer the door...cursing the blindfold and wishing I knew my floorplan better. &quot;Come with me miss&quot;, said a polite voice.....his driver, of course. He led me down the stairs and into the back of a waiting car. I sat there fidgeting with the hem of my dress...fear intermingling with excitement. I wasn't wearing much....the box had contained only three items....a little black slip of a dress, a pair of black heels, and the blindfold. It was December for goodness sake. The car came to a halt about ten minutes later and I inhaled sharply as the cold night air danced over my body. I could feel it between my legs, making me shiver even more. It was him.....I knew the smell of his skin...it was burned into my memory. I opened my mouth to speak and found his thumb pressing against my full lips. &quot;Shhhhhhh! No words...no sound&quot;...was all he had said. His lips replaced his thumb...urgent and demanding....bruising my lips. His teeth ground against them as he pressed harder. I felt something cold touch my bare shoulder as he cut the straps of my little dress, exposing my breasts. He pinched each nipple until it was swollen and erect. I could hear him move away and his voice was deep and serious when he instructed me to pull up my dress for him. My fingers shook as I obeyed him....something about that voice told me that he was not playing with me. &quot;Spread your legs for me.....wide&quot;. I ran my hands seductively down my thighs and parted my knees fully. I traced backwards with my fingernails, fully intent on exposing myself to him. He seemed to know what I had in mind and grabbed my hand....he sucked slowly on my fingers and then let my hand drop. &quot;I want to touch you, too&quot;, he had said with a laugh..&quot;But you haven't earned it&quot;. He quickly wound his arms behind my back and tied them together at the wrists. I whimpered and he pulled the restraints even tighter. I bit my lip and remained silent. I sensed that it was not a good time for disobedience. Roughly, he shoved my knees further apart and slid his hands up my thighs...his thumbs meeting just above my throbbing clit. I was desperate for him to touch me...to feel his fingers slide into my soft pussy. Then I could feel his hot breath as he moved his face over me...not touching....just teasing...the warm tingle of desire became an inferno when I realized how close his mouth was to my clit. I arched my back and lifted my hips, hoping to get closer. Bad idea, of course......he threw me over his knees and slapped me hard.....twice. I could feel his fingers burning into the delicate skin of my backside. Tears stung the corners of my eyes as he shoved me back into my seat. The car rolled to a stop. Again the cold rush of night air on my skin...making my nipples grow harder. I couldn't stop shaking as the chill swept over my wet pussy. I heard another person get in...now I was becoming really frightened.... <br> This is a limo...I thought, as our new occupant sat down across from me. My mind was racing as soft fingertips started tracing patterns all over me....a woman. He knew I had always been curious, and he had always threatened to make it a reality. Now, my reality was kneading my breasts with her hands and I was in heaven. I carefully stifled a moan as her tongue sought out mine in my eager mouth. I let hers slip in and out a few times and then caught it up and began to suck it hard, like it was a cock. She pulled away and I felt her mouth close over one nipple. I could barely stand the excitement...warm fluid was dripping out of my pussy now...running down my legs and onto the seat. She let her hand move down my stomach and I could feel her fingernails touch my pubic hair. I didn't breath for a moment...waiting to feel her fingers inside of me.<br> I was disappointed when he pulled us apart. I wasn't ready for our fllirtation to end. He wrapped his arms around me and pulled me onto his lap...my back to him. I could feel his huge cock touching my soaking wet pussy and I knew I must be dripping all over it. He began to stroke it back and forth....getting is slippery wet and laughing every time it touched my clit and I jumped. I could feel the lips of my pussy separate to accomodate his throbbing dick and I was desperately wanting him to fuck me. &quot;Tell her what to do&quot;, he commanded. What did THAT mean? Tell her what? I hesitated and he delivered another hard slap to my bottom. My voice betrayed me and cracked when I spoke. &quot;I..want you to taste me&quot;...I managed. SLAP!...Again those fingers burning my skin. I choked back a yell that was surfacing and told the woman to get on her knees and lick and suck us both while we fucked. To make my point, I pulled her close by her hair...shoving her face against my slippery pussy and grinding it against her face.<br> My reward for pleasing him........he rammed his fat cock inside of me as hard as he could without warning. I screamed as I felt white hot pain spreading through my belly and down my legs. He grabbed a handful of hair and yanked my head back onto his shoulder. He bit my swollen lower lip...my face...my neck...I could feel his teeth sinking painfully into my shoulder and I could taste blood as I bit back a second scream. My body was throbbing all over, but I would have begged him not to stop. Then his lips...soft and reassuring...kissing me...whispering soft words...almost an apology. My breath came in ragged gasps as sweat trailed down my neck and between my tits. He rubbed it into my skin...pausing to pinch my nipples until they were purple. Then he began to fuck me....slowly shoving the length of his cock into my well lubricated cunt. I could feel the lips of my pussy parting as he buried every inch of his erection deep inside of me...rubbing against his shaft...making it wetter...hotter. It started to feel insanely good...the friction was incredible..but I was silent. I knew the rules of the game now.<br> When she began to use her mouth on us, I thought I would faint. I could feel my eyes roll as my head started to swim. It was ecstasy...there had never been a feeling like this. Her tongue ran frantic circles all over my pussy and up and down his shaft as he continued to fuck me. The sensations started to mingle and I couldn't keep track of them....soft lips and tongue...rock hard penetration....the feeling of his teeth lingering on my skin. He began to move faster, gripping my hips with his powerful hands and letting his fingernails dig into my skin. I rocked my hips against his pelvis...trying to get closer...trying to swallow him up. The faster his throbbing cock jammed into me, the faster her mouth worked...rivulets of pleasure raced throughout my body...burning pathways down my legs and up through my torso. He seemed to forget himself and groaned. I smiled to myself. I could feel tremors coming from a long way off. His cock felt impossibly swollen and huge. It kept getting wetter and hotter as he plunged it in and out of my slippery pussy. His breathing was rapid and his grip on me tightened painfully. &quot;Fuck me harder!&quot; my mind screamed, but I didn't dare voice it....he was reaching a dangerous level of excitement and I didn't know what he would do to me. I bucked wildly as the woman kneeling before me sucked my clit in between her eager lips. I allowed myself a deep sigh as her mouth tightened around it. Behind me, he yanked my hair again and kissed me when my head reached his shoulder....my body was in pain all over...different sensations were everywhere. I couldn't resist.....I bit his lip...wanting to cause him pain. He growled...a sound that emerged from deep within his chest as he bit me back. A tear slipped down my cheek as I struggled not to cry out. The woman began to suck harder on my clit and reached down to cup him in her hand....squeezing him firmly. The tremors that seemed so far away were now wracking my body..the heat spread from my clit in wave upon wave of pleasure. My pussy started to spasm and I gasped as I came....it seemed to go on forever...making my clit jump and sending rivers of cum down his stroking cock.<br> The woman moved down and started to lick his balls...first one and then the other. He groaned as she took one of them in her mouth. He was shoving his cock into me to the hilt as she sucked on him intently. I could feel him getting bigger....I thought he would burst. While the woman worked her lips she fingered herself and I found myself longing to taste her on my lips...to pleasure her. His fingers bruised my skin as he fucked me like a madman. &quot;Harder!&quot; I demanded...not caring if I would be punished......He slapped me again and again....I shoved back against him roughly...meeting him halfway...wanting to hurt him. I could feel him tense up then...the muscles bulging in his forearms and sweat dripping down his chest as he climaxed...I could feel a hot rush as his cum slicked the walls of my already glistening pussy. He moaned as he worked it all out of his cock. I tightened my muscles and heard him moan again. Finally...he slowed to a stop and rested his forehead on my back....breathing deeply. <br> After a few moments, he gently moved me off of his lap and untied my hands....kissing each wrist tenderly. Then he turned me around and kissed my eyes, my chin..my lips. His kisses were soft and sensual on my swollen and bruised lips. His mouth closed over one nipple and then the other...stroking with his tongue. I turned and kissed our forgotten third party full on the mouth...tangling my tongue with hers....whispering thank you. The car stopped and she got out...I had never seen her face.<br> We pulled up in front of my apartment and he led me inside. Then..finally, the blindfold came off. I blinked as my eyes adjusted to the light. &quot;Oh....it IS you&quot;, I said, and he laughed. He kissed me once more and looked straight into my eyes. A gesture that said it was goodbye....for now. </p> <p></p> <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> </font></b></p> <!-- #EndEditable --></td>
