                          <td colspan="2" width="100%"> <!-- #BeginEditable "story" --> <p> It is Breakfast Time and Television Screens throughout the country are tuned to Arouse Yourself on the Cable Television Station Harlot TV, just one of the many Sex TV Stations available. Harlot TV is a Three X classified station, which means that it is considered responsible enough to broadcast Hard Core Porn, but hasn't yet got a Four X classification allowing it to go to the very edge of Sex Broadcasting. For years, Harlot TV has struggled to attain this status ? broadcasting serious Sex Documentaries, serious Sex Discussion programs and commisioning drama programs where sex, although the obvious raison d'&ecirc;tre, is supported by reasonable story?lines and scripted dialogue. <br> In the Arouse Yourself studio, there are three naked people. One is Frank, the show's host, and another is one of today's guests, a top magazine model Samantha. Frank has his prick firmly up Samantha's cunt (not her arse, as this is Breakfast Television and rules have to obeyed) and the Television cameras are alternating between shots of the penetration and Samantha's ecstatic facial expressions (which are probably as much faked as on the cover of the magazines in which Samantha appears). The hostess of the show, Anna, has put on a bath?robe and is wiping her cunt dry with a tissue. A few items ago, she had had sex with another guest on a Sexual Exercises Item. She is seven months pregnant and part of the theme of her continued appearance is that sex is still compatible with pregnancy. <br> The third naked person is Emma. She is not having sex, has not had sex today and has no intention of doing so. In fact Emma has only once in her life had sex and she enjoyed it so little she hasn't done so since. However, Emma is a Strict Naturist, as well as a Strict Vegetarian and a Strict Tee?Totaller. She works as a Research Assistant for Arouse Yourself which involves finding guests for the program, assessing the amount of sexual activity they are willing to undertake (which varies by choice and fee ? the more sex the bigger the fee) and drawing up a schedule of questions and chat?up lines for the presenters. <br> The reason she works on Harlot TV is not because she is a great supporter of pornographic television. Indeed, she finds the theme of sex rather monotonous with its limited range of permutations constantly paraded on the screen. The reason is that there are not very many employers who are willing to employ a Strict Naturist ? one who wears clothes for the smallest possible period of time. In fact, the stricter a Naturist one is the less time one wears clothes and the fewer clothes one owns. Emma owns only one item of clothing ? a bikini bottom she wears to work in the Summer. The others she borrows from her flat?mates. She wouldn't own the bikini either if she wasn't frightened of germs. She washes the bikini bottom every day after wearing it. <br> It isn't Summer now, but a quite cool day in Spring but Emma came to work wearing only a coat she borrowed from her flat?mate, Charlotte, which comes half?way down her thighs. It was very early in the morning when Emma arrived and there weren't that many people about, so she was able to discard even this coat when she got a seat on the underground train until she got near enough to the City Centre. Nudism is still illegal in most places, although toplessness was rarely frowned on except at particular places like the Opera or the work?place. It was a relief when Emma got to work and was able to hang the coat up. It was an old coat that made her look a bit like a tramp, but Emma made a point of never evaluating clothes except on the basis of how much flesh they covered up. <br> She wasn't the strictest Naturist imaginable. She occasionally trimmed her thick mousey?brown hair, which only grew to half?way down her back, and she regularly washed it. She also took care to wear something on her feet ? but strictly of a utilitarian nature. Because it was Spring, these were currently little flat?soled booties with fur lining as Emma didn't wear socks. However, she never wore make?up and she never shaved any of the hair on her body, particularly not around her cunt which had a rich thick body of hair slightly darker than the hair on her head. <br> After the program finished, there was the usual discussion on how the program went and then there would normally have been the briefing where staff would discuss which items would be scheduled for future presentation. Unexpectedly however, Emma was summoned to the Managing Director's office. What could this mean? Emma wondered. Perhaps this was another employer, like her last, Sun TV, a holiday TV station, who were tightening up on the licence they allowed their staff. <br> The Managing Director was a small man with a penchant for cigars, which Emma found thoroughly disgusting but she restrained the temptation to comment. His office resembled the office of most Managing Directors except for the scattered pictures of Harlot TV presenters in different degrees of undress. <br> &quot;This is going to be a very confidential meeting between just you and me, Emma,&quot; the Managing Director announced. &quot;The main point is that I'm taking you off Arouse Yourself.&quot; <br> This hit Emma as the least welcome news she could imagine. She'd enjoyed working for the program and had got the distinct impression that the rest of the program staff got on with her and had a high regard for her abilities. Sure, there had been difficulties at the beginning with all the male staff trying to seduce her on the misapprehension she was like those other Naturists who equated freedom from the tyranny of clothes as the freedom to fuck whoever you wanted all the time. <br> &quot;Is that because of my Naturist views?&quot; Emma ventured to ask. <br> &quot;No, not at all!&quot; reassured the Managing Director. &quot;Some 20% of my staff are Naturists of one kind or another ? most being men of course. No, the only odd thing is that you're in the minority of Naturists here who aren't presenters or stand?ins! I'm taking you off because I want to give you a more responsible job.&quot; <br> &quot;Thank you, sir. That's a great relief.&quot; <br> &quot;As you know, Harlot TV has wanted to get Four X rating for a long time. You must know how limiting it is for us when we have to skirt round such things as under?age sex, sado?masochism, bestiality, and so on. It takes great skill to work within the limits that are bound for us as a Three X station. Well, and this is highly confidential, we will be getting Four X status soon. The Minister for the Arts and Entertainment has personally assured me that the quality of our programming is now of a high enough and responsible level for us to get that extra X. This will do wonders for our prestige, increase our audience figures, boost advertising revenue and improve the value of the Company's shares!&quot; <br> &quot;That's wonderful news!&quot; exclaimed Emma. Perhaps she was going to get more pay. But she wouldn't do any sex and certainly not on television. <br> &quot;You are a very presentable and responsible young lady, Emma. I've heard very good reports about you from all at Arouse Yourself. Perhaps at some future stage we might find a job for you as a presenter on a program ? not one I hasten to add involving sex, as I gather that's not to your taste, but on Naturist issues. No, I want you to do some confidential research for me.&quot; <br> &quot;Research?&quot; <br> &quot;Yes. A job requiring discretion and dedication but most of all secrecy. Which is why you are perfect. Not even staff of Harlot TV, let alone our competitors must know of the fact that we will be getting that extra X. It could ruin everything!&quot; <br> The Managing Director then went on to explain that the Research would be to scour around for material from the video companies, foreign countries or wherever that would be suitable for Four X program scheduling policy, so that when the extra X was officially awarded all would be in place for rapid insatllation. She would not need to come to the office except to use office facilities when necessary, her expenses would be automatically paid by the company and her official role was General Programming Research Assistant. </p> <p></p> <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> </font></b></p> <!-- #EndEditable --></td>
