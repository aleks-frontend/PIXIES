              <p>After your flight had left i checked on the arrival time of Miles 
                again....to make sure it had not been delayed...and then chose 
                a small quiet restaurant to have coffee and to eat breakfast...my 
                head was spinning from the assignment you had given me to teach 
                him to be a Master...and i was still smarting a bit from my last 
                failure....but i knew i had to put that out of my mind and just 
                concentrate on the next task at hand...so i was thankful for the 
                few hours i had until his arrival to plan this all out....not 
                knowing exactly what he knew or didn't know...it seemed like a 
                huge task to undertake....but i had no intentions of failing you 
                again.... </p>
              <p>I was still lost deep in thought as i made my way to his arrival gate....mentally 
          checking things off that we would cover ...when the announcement was 
          made that his flight had landed...it didn't take me long to spot him...he 
          was just as you had described him...tall, slender, muscular...a beautiful 
          tone to his skin and very handsome...i grinned to myself a little as 
          my eyes wandered over him...and i could already feel the stirrings in 
          my body as he approached me....he knew what i would be wearing so he 
          came straight to me ...his voice soft...but with a steadiness that belied 
          his shyness....his eyes were clear and kind...and he had a smile that 
          would melt the toughest of submissives...</p>
        <p>I had decided to let him drive on the way back to the house...the first 
          tiny step in giving him control...so when we got to the car i took his 
          bags and put them in the trunk and then turned to him and handed the 
          keys...i could see the surprise on his face and i just smiled at him 
          as i gave him directions to your house...even the look on his face when 
          i took his bags startled him a bit...and i knew that he was not used 
          to a woman doing for him...but i could tell that he enjoyed it ....i 
          slid into the seat next to him and the banter between us was light and 
          easy on the way home...i could tell that he was attracted to me as well 
          and was thankful because that would make my job all that much easier....</p>
        <p>I once again took his bags from the car...and saw the amused look on 
          his face as we walked to the door...i handed him the house keys and 
          waited until he went in before i slipped in behind him...i set the bags 
          down by the hall and then turned to face him once again...he was just 
          standing there..not quite sure what he was supposed to do next..so i 
          quickly walked over to him and took his coat...hung it in the hall closet 
          and then motioned him to sit in the chair next to yours...a chair very 
          similar to yours...without the adaptations that you had made for our 
          convenience...i knew from what you had told me that he was a wine drinker 
          as well...so when i saw him get comfortable i went and got him a glass 
          of red wine...we chatted briefly about what his expectations were from 
          this encounter...and when he finished his wine i led him to the computer 
          room and gave him some sites to look at...specifically www.castlerealm.com.....and 
          then with a reassuring smile i left him explaining that i would be back 
          after i got him settled into the guest room...his immediate response 
          was ...&quot;oh no...let me do that&quot;...i just smiled at him and 
          laughed softly....&quot;first thing you're going to have to realize 
          is that a submissive NEEDS to do these things.....it's what she lives 
          for..to serve men...and we have much ground to cover in just a short 
          time...so you look over the information while i do this for you&quot;...and 
          before he could say anything else i vanished out of the room and left 
          him to peruse the website...</p>
        <p>I turned on the CD player before picking up his bags and put on some 
          soft music...and then quickly went about arranging his belongings in 
          the drawers....hanging up the clothing he had in his zipped bags...arranging 
          his toiletries in the bathroom off of his room...and just making sure 
          that all was perfection for him...when everything was put away i went 
          to get him ...showing him where his room was and leaving the drawers 
          open and the closet open for his inspection....i quietly stood off to 
          the side of the room as he looked everything over telling him that if 
          there was anything not the way he wanted it to let me know and it would 
          be changed to his satisfaction...i could sense the uneasiness in him 
          about doing that...and once again i reassured him that being a Dominant 
          meant training a submissive to his specific wants and needs...he smiled 
          that unarming smile at me and i could feel my heart melt a little...and 
          as he stopped in front of the closet i could see that he was not entirely 
          pleased...he turned to me and with a soft voice...almost shyly...he 
          stated that he liked his shirts hung the opposite way on the hanger....i 
          smiled at him and told him not a problem and then quickly changed them 
          all around...i could still feel the uneasiness in him...but i was hoping 
          that by the time you got back that some of that would be gone....as 
          he nodded with approval at everything else i closed the drawers and 
          the closet door and left the lamp on that was on the nightstand .....</p>
        <p>I could tell that he was waiting for me to leave the room first....and 
          i gently nudged him out the door explaining that the Dominant always 
          takes the lead....and the submissive will follow behind him...i could 
          only imagine the things that were going thru his mind...but he was taking 
          to his training well so far...and as i walked back into the living room 
          i could see that he had printed a bunch of stuff off of castle realm....as 
          he went to sit back in his chair....i pulled the cushion over from the 
          foot of yours...which i had noticed him eyeing when we first came into 
          the room.....and i knelt quietly at his feet.....not in the traditional 
          nadu...with my thighs spread...as i always kneel for you....but i knelt 
          in tower...with my knees pressed modestly together and my posture perfect....i 
          lowered my eyes to him and asked him for permission to speak...and once 
          again i could feel the discomfort in him as he said yes...</p>
        <p>My voice rang soft and clear in the room as i lifted my eyes to him 
          and began to talk....</p>
        <p>&quot;I realize that much of what i am doing is totally foreign to 
          you...it's not the way of the &quot;modern&quot; woman to act like this...in 
          fact...it's totally opposite of what &quot;society&quot; and the &quot;woman's 
          movement&quot; have laid down as ground rules for women in society today...we 
          are raised now in this society to be independent...equal to a man...to 
          share the duties of a household...to believe that we are equal to men 
          in all ways....except for the physical strength...and yet there are 
          some of us out here that do not fit into that mold...some women realize 
          at a very early age that they are &quot;different&quot;...that something 
          in all of this doesn't quite ring true for them...they are criticized 
          for their giving nature....for their sensitivity...for their need....and 
          yes...it is true need in a submissive...to totally give to a man....some 
          are lucky and stumble on information early on that they can identify 
          with ....and they find out that they are not so strange after all...that 
          what they are are submissives...and they study and they learn...and 
          they grow confident in their submissive nature...but most of us don't 
          have access to that information early on...so we struggle thru failed 
          marriages...or are in marriages that don't satisfy our true needs...always 
          wondering what is missing...but eventually...even we find the information 
          that we are looking for....because it's a driving need within us that 
          MUST be fulfilled...and now with the internet explosion....that information 
          is more readily available to women...&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Don't think for one minute that a submissive is a doormat...or 
          is weak.....because i think that submissives are stronger than most 
          women who aren't in this lifestyle...i don't say that as a put down..to 
          each his own..or her own in this case....although there are male submissives 
          as well which we'll cover at another time if you would like to know 
          about that...i would venture to say that most people that a submissive 
          interacts with every day probably has no idea that she is even a sub...just 
          because a woman &quot;allows&quot; a Dominant ...and the key word here 
          is allows...to have control of her...has no reflection on how she acts 
          in the outside world away from the safety and security of her Dominant...a 
          submissive may hold a powerful position in the corporate world...or 
          may just be a waitress...because society frowns on this lifestyle...thinking 
          we are in it for the &quot;pain&quot;..or the humiliation...or the many 
          other misconceptions which surround this lifestyle....which is actually 
          another whole part of this lifestyle...and not related at all to what 
          my idea of D/s (Dominance/submission) is...we for the most part choose 
          not to reveal this side of us...&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Submission from weakness on the part of a woman? What Dom really 
          wants that? Oh sure...maybe for a scene...for a one night fling...but 
          to cultivate into a long term loving relationship? i personally feel 
          sorry for these women....and i think they don't truly understand the 
          beauty of who they are and what they can become under the hand of a 
          strong Dominant...the same goes for a doormat...even though the relationship 
          is very similar in many respects to &quot;normal&quot; ones....there 
          is an underlying vast difference ...and this is the area where most 
          people who don't understand this don't get it...and unfortunately...probably 
          never will...but this is not for everyone....so what's the difference 
          here?....it is the needs of the submissive.....and also it is the needs 
          of the Dominant...it is her need to give up her power to him...to feel 
          so safe that she is comfortable doing this....to trust so blindly that 
          she knows her Dominant will not make a decision that will harm her in 
          any way...it's about obedience...obeying even when you don't want to...when 
          you feel that you can't...when you're struggling with everything in 
          you to do as your Dom wants you to do......it's about not hiding anything 
          from your Dominant...sounds easy huh? but just think about that statement 
          for a moment....we are conditioned to not reveal our deepest darkest 
          secrets and fears....and finally it's about surrender...when you have 
          found the Dom that you know will care for you, protect you, and guide 
          you to and thru the deepest desires of your heart&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Are their natural Doms and subs? of course they are...but even 
          at that...you still need to study...to find out what is right for you...just 
          as subs grow in their submissiveness....a Dom will grow in his dominance 
          as well...and that strength ...and the quiet power....is what will draw 
          a sub to you.....just remember one thing...a Dom is not a Dom to one 
          unless she &quot;willingly&quot; gives him that power...it's not something 
          that can be taken...or forced......submission has been called a gift....and 
          while that term is highly exploited right now in the scene...it is in 
          fact a gift...you only have as much power as the submissive will give 
          you....do submissives have rights? of course they do...and most have 
          limits as well...it is a subs responsibility to tell you her limits...and 
          as there are things that come up that she herself may not even be aware 
          of...there is a need for a safeword as well...the safeword will let 
          you know that this is a place she doesn't want to go to...or something 
          that she doesn't want to do...and a responsible Dom will honor that...and 
          cease the activity immediately when that word is spoken....&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;And what rights does he have in all of this? He has the right 
          to 100% total obedience....he has the right to use her in anyway he 
          sees fit within the pre defined limits...he has the right to total loyalty 
          ...he has the right to correct her....he has the right to push her limits...and 
          he has the right to take control of her body..mind and soul.....&quot;</p>
        <p>I realized i had been talking for a long time now...and i could see 
          him taking in every bit of this information....and then he gently reached 
          over and cupped my chin...lifting my eyes to meet his....and he asked 
          a profound question to one so new to this...&quot;and the submissive....what 
          emotions run thru her when she has found the Dom that can do all these 
          things for her?&quot;....a slow smile spread across my face....and at 
          that instant i knew without a doubt that he was going to be a wonderful 
          Dominant to some very lucky sub...my eyes never leaving his as once 
          again i began to speak...&quot;the feeling of being owned...being possessed 
          by the man that you love more than life itself...is overwhelming at 
          times...it encompasses your whole being...your every thought is of him...everything 
          you do you do for him...your happiness rests squarely on the fact whether 
          or not he is happy.....the tiniest disappointment in him you take to 
          heart...the slightest bit of praise will send your heart soaring...there 
          is a freedom in submission unlike any other..it is the freedom to become 
          the woman you've always wanted to be..it is the freedom to love like 
          never before...a love with no boundaries..because you know in your heart 
          that is what your Dom expects from you...and you do it willingly...you 
          do it because you have no choice but to do it...&quot;....i could feel 
          the tears welling up in my eyes...thinking of you and how far we have 
          come since you placed your collar on me....i lowered my eyes but i knew 
          he had seen the misting in my eyes...my voice almost shaking as i continued..&quot;it 
          is every submissives dream to find a Dom like this....one that will 
          free her totally....one that will push and nudge at her barriers...and 
          one that will love her and accept her just the way she is..with all 
          her flaws and all her insecurities..&quot; He just smiled at me...knowing 
          i was totally overcome with emotion and he kiddingly retorted...&quot;So 
          what does a Dom have to do for food around here?&quot;...at that i burst 
          into laughter and looking at the clock and realizing how late it was...i 
          quickly replied...&quot;ummmmm....i know a good pizza place that delivers&quot;....</p>
        <p>We spent the rest of the evening covering a multitude of questions 
          he had....and then finally when we both were almost falling asleep...i 
          excused myself .....turning at the hallway on the way to the bedroom 
          and with a sly little grin....&quot;Oh yeah...tomorrow we go over toys 
          and then a session with me at Masters orders&quot;....seeing the stunned 
          look on his face before i turned and headed to the room...chuckling 
          softly as i thought how much fun this was going to be....</p>
        <p><br>
          I was thankfull that unlike you your cousin was a late sleeper...as 
          the only time i got that luxury was when you were out of town...<br>
          I still woke up before he did though...and was sitting at the kitchen 
          table drinking my coffee thinking about you....missing you....and all 
          that your cousin and i had covered last night....i have to admit my 
          pussy was more than a little wet thinking about scening with him...so 
          when he entered the kitchen i was a little startled to see him staring 
          at my hard nipples jutting out from underneath my silky nightgown....i 
          gave him a teasing little smile and gestured for him to sit down ....and 
          i noticed his cock hard and almost standing straight out in front of 
          him...even though he tried to hide it.......a soft little silent whimper 
          escaped from me and it was all i could do to not touch myself as i slid 
          out of the chair and went to get him coffee...i could feel his eyes 
          burning into me as he followed the soft sway of my hips...the nightgown 
          i had wasn't sheer...but i knew the outline of my hips and the shape 
          of my ass was clearly visible to him...those eyes sent a little chill 
          thru me and i felt a small drop of pussy juice trickle down my leg....</p>
        <p>Over our coffee and breakfast the discussion naturally turned to the 
          varied toys , whips, floggers, crops, vibes, plugs, clamps, and everything 
          else used in BDSM play...i knew his head had to be reeling from so much 
          information so fast....but his questions were always well thought out....and 
          i could sense that he was absorbing this like a sponge...and what he 
          didn't remember right away...i knew was stored somewhere in his mind 
          that he could call upon it if he had to....</p>
        <p>I finally stretched...my breasts rising softly under the soft material....and 
          told him i had some errands i needed to do for you ...to make himself 
          at home ...and that i would be back very shortly...and still those eyes 
          were penetrating me...devouring me...stripping me of me clothing...i 
          shivered a bit and scurried down the hall to the bedroom....jumping 
          into the shower and throwing on a pair of jeans..a low cut sweater and 
          a tailored denim jacket...quickly tying my tennis shoes and then asking 
          him for the car keys...his eyes once again sweeping over me...deliberately...thouroghly...noting 
          his approval of what i was wearing even though he didn't say a word....he 
          tossed the keys at me and i reached out and caught them deftly with 
          my right hand...blowing a little kiss to him as i walked out the door...</p>
        <p>I had been gone for about 3 hours....and when i got back he was sitting 
          in the chair next to yours...a stack of papers next to him...so i knew 
          he had been at the computer again printing out more information....he 
          was drinking coffee still and i sensed something in him that wasn't 
          there when i left....a new confidence maybe? ...the way he just raised 
          his head from what he was reading and barely glanced at me when i entered....his 
          voice now unwavering as he calmly stated that as soon as i put everything 
          away i was to come to his side again....i grinned a little and wondered 
          at this transformation...but quickly set about putting away groceries 
          ...hanging your clothes from the dry cleaner...and doing all the other 
          little things that needed to be done...i hung up my jacket and then 
          quietly walked back to his chair....once again drifting to my knees...looking 
          up at him questioningly....</p>
        <p>&quot;Lee called while you were gone&quot;....and immediately a look 
          of dissapointment crossed my face that i had missed an opportunity to 
          talk to you....but as the conversation went on...it became clear that 
          you had called when you knew i would be out...specifically to talk to 
          Miles.......his voice was much like yours....warm and reassuring...but 
          i knew a bomb was about to be dropped....and i was right...&quot;Lee 
          tells me that you failed an assignment he had given you....and that 
          we are to correct that today when we scene&quot;...my eyes flew up to 
          him...knowing that he was telling the truth because i had never mentioned 
          that to him...&quot;Yes...if that's what Master wishes...that's what 
          we will do&quot;...&quot;now go change for me and put on something you 
          think i'll like&quot;..again i was taken aback by the calm authority 
          in his voice...and of course i immediately responded to his command....</p>
        <p>As i walked back to the bedroom thinking about what to put on ..i also 
          wondered what was said during that phone call...what you had said that 
          had made such a drastic difference in his demeanor...i chose a pair 
          of crotchless hose...and a long sweater that came to my mid thigh...i 
          wore no bra and my breasts bounced lightly as i walked back into the 
          room...immediately slipping to a kneel at his feet...only this time 
          in nadu...with my thighs spread wide...my sex glistening softly in the 
          light of the day...i knew he could smell my heat because it had been 
          awhile since you had allowed me to cum....and i wondered if he was going 
          to give me that luxury or if you had instructed him not to...</p>
        <p>He calmly looked me over...and if he was excited at all ...he gave 
          no indication of it now..i glanced down at his cock and it was semi 
          hard...but that's not uncommon for a 23 year old man...the clingy sweater 
          hung to the shape of my breasts and my nipples were hard and extended 
          as i knelt before him...he could see the smooth contour of my taut stomach 
          and the swell of my hips ...and of course my dripping pussy was totally 
          exposed to him now...he grinned down at me...very nice angel..now take 
          off the sweater for me...i glanced up at him for a moment and then lifted 
          the soft clingy fabric over my head...shaking my hair back into place 
          as i dropped the sweater to my side...and when i looked up again he 
          had a pair of nipple clamps in his hands...i almost gasped out loud 
          as his long strong fingers tugged and pinched at my nipples....and then 
          biting my bottom lip hard as he attached the clamps...a chain between 
          them as his middle finger gave a slight little tug...he could see the 
          reaction in me and i knew this spurred him on more...</p>
        <p>His long lank frame moved gracefully out of the chair....and then my 
          eyes widened as he shoved the chair across the room...in front of the 
          full length bay windows ....and then he looked back at me as he pulled 
          the curtains back and let the blinds up...i know a horrified look must 
          have crossed my face...and it was at that moment that the teacher in 
          me died....and a new Dom was born...thankfully where the house was located 
          there were no children in the area...but the neighborhood was pretty 
          active on the week ends with comings and goings...i was still kneeling 
          on the cushion and as he sat down in his chair in front of the window 
          he instructed me to go get a paddle and a crop....and to bring my cushion 
          to place next to his chair when i was done retrieving the items he had 
          asked for....as soon as i stood up...one of the neighbors was coming 
          out of his door...i had to turn to go get the items asked for...and 
          i knew he had seen me standing there ...naked...my cunt exposed...i 
          saw the hesitation in his step and i blushed furiously....and as i quickly 
          turned around.....my round firm ass now exposed...i swear i could feel 
          the neighbors eyes on me all the way to the room...as i entered the 
          room i leaned against the doorway...my hands visibly shaking...tears 
          stinging at my eyes as i knew this was just the beginning...and wondering 
          how many others would see....</p>
        <p>I finally gathered my composure again and got the paddle and the crop...my 
          eyes darting nervously as i came back into the living room.....bending 
          over and reaching for the cushion...my full breasts dangling with the 
          nipple clamps still attached...i quietly handed him the items and then 
          sunk back to my knees...my thighs once again spread wide...and at that 
          instant he brought the crop down and hit a light stinging blow to the 
          tender skin...spread them wider for me angel...i gasped at the unexpected 
          blow and nudged my thighs even wider apart....i looked up at him and 
          he nodded his approval....smiling at me as he said...&quot;much better 
          angel..much better&quot;....i just knelt there like that for what seemed 
          an eternity before he spoke again...each time a car would go by he'd 
          tug at the chain on my nipples..and that flash of embarassement would 
          run thru me....wondering if they had seen...wondering if it was a man 
          or woman in the car...or both...he could see my uneasiness...and made 
          me kneel there for quite a long time like that...on display to the whole 
          neighborhood....to anyone that looked into the windows...which was hard 
          not to do as they ran from floor to ceiling...and then his voice almost 
          startled me ....&quot;Lee tells me your quite the little cocksucker 
          angel..&quot;...and at that moment he reached into his pants and freed 
          his enormous cock...my eyes widened as they were just rivited to it...and 
          he laughed as he said...&quot;hmmmmm....my cousin was right....you are 
          a little cock slut&quot;....i just lowered my eyes..knowing that the 
          people passing couldn't hear what was said...but in my mind at that 
          moment they could...and then to my horror he moved his chair directly 
          in front of the window and motioned me to follow...</p>
        <p>His cock was standing straight up ...thick and rigid....as he grabbed 
          me by the hair and pulled me to him...pressing my lips against the cockhead 
          and forcing them open with his insistant pressure at the back of my 
          head...my mouth opened automatically....lips pressing tightly around 
          the cockhead and sucking on it softly....tongue lapping eagerly over 
          the rim as i heard laughter coming from the street....wondering if they 
          were laughing at me or at just some passing joke between them...i froze 
          for a second and he sensed that and his hands went reassuringly to my 
          head again...pushing me deeper onto his engorged cock....but my cheeks 
          i knew were flushed from embaressement...</p>
        <p>I had no idea how long he was going to subject me to this...and of 
          course he wouldn't tell me...i only knew that if my sexual perfermance 
          was anything less that what i did with you you would punish me....and 
          i didn't need or want that when you got back...so i took a deep breath..and 
          tried my best to block out the outside world...his hands steadily guided 
          his cock in and out of my mouth.....and it wasn't long before i was 
          devouring it hungrily....licking and tasting him...holding his cock 
          deep in my throat until i was gasping for air and then running my tongue 
          up the length....looking up into his eyes as my tongue flicked under 
          the head ....but every once in awhile looking out of the corner of my 
          eye and seeing someone else pass by...i just cringed inside but continued 
          to lap and lick at his cock...i knew that he was close to cumming as 
          his cock was now jerking in my mouth...and his moans were getting louder...which 
          of course does nothing but spur me on even more...i took him deep into 
          my throat one last time and then he jerked his cock from my mouth and 
          sprayed his cum all over my face and hair...his scent so different from 
          yours was my only thought at that moment...and then i carefully and 
          methodically cleaned his cock ....the cum still dripping from my face....his 
          smile melting me again ....and then to my utter surprise he told me 
          to stand up and close the curtains and the blinds...cum dripping off 
          my face...nipple clamps on....and crotchless hose on...again that little 
          cringe deep within me but fearing your punishment more than the looks 
          i would get...i rose quickly from his feet...i know i stood there for 
          a full 2 minutes wrestling with the blinds...totally exposed to everyone 
          passing by...tears stinging at my eyes as i closed the blinds and then 
          the curtains...returning to kneel at his feet when i was finished...he 
          gently stroked my hair and tilted my face up to his...i couldn't keep 
          the tears from flowing any longer as he gently told me to go shower 
          and freshen up....that we were done for the day ....and the rest of 
          the night would be spent relaxing....</p>
        <p>Miles and i had spent the rest of the previous evening just chit chatting....his 
          questions now more demanding...more insightful in nature...after i had 
          showered and changed back into my jeans we had decided to go out to 
          eat...we chose a Mexican restaruant not far from the house......and 
          i had a couple of margaritas and he had a few beers as we just sat there 
          and ate and talked for hours...i knew the margaritas would just eventually 
          make me hornier....but at this point i needed some relief from the tension 
          that was building in me...as we were talking there was one little waitress 
          that kept coming around ....constantly checking on us..and i didn't 
          really think anything of it until i noticed the sparks flying between 
          her and Miles....and then i began to observe a little more closely....her 
          eyes were always lowered as she spoke to him..and she catered to his 
          every whim and need...because she was good at what she did...she never 
          failed to make sure i was taken care of as well...but when she spoke 
          to me she would look me in the eye and her smile was warm and genuine...my 
          instincts told me she was a submissive...and when Miles had left the 
          table to go to the mens room she approached me and shyly asked if Miles 
          was my man...i told her no....that he was my Masters cousin....waiting 
          to see what kind of reaction that solicited from her...her head jerked 
          up and she smiled wide....and him? referring to Miles...is he a Dom 
          as well?...i grinned at her...&quot;He's just now finding his dominance...but 
          he will be a wonderful Dom &quot;...once again she smiled at me....her 
          voice soft and almost lilting ...&quot;and i am just now finding my 
          submissive side&quot;....i knew immediately i would take this young 
          gentle sub under my wing....we quickly exchanged phone numbers and addresses...and 
          she didn't live that far from us...just a few blocks down...i asked 
          her when her next day off was....and she told me tomorrow...i couldn't 
          believe how this was all falling into place...i invited her to dinner 
          the next night...and she eagerly accepted....but i told her to not mention 
          this to Miles...that it would be a surprise for him when she showed 
          up...i winked at her as Miles lingered a bit to talk to her some more 
          as we were getting ready to leave..and i made myself scarce to give 
          them some private time...</p>
        <p>I was pretty mellow from the drinks by the time we finally got home 
          and decided to go to bed..i turned to Miles and thanked him once again 
          for allowing me to serve him earlier that day and kissed his cheek tenderly...before 
          going to the bedroom i stepped into his and pulled back his covers..made 
          sure there were clean towels in his bathroom...and turned the lamp on 
          next to his bed....</p>
        <p>As i was getting ready for bed i heard Miles turn on the TV..and my 
          drifted back to our session...his innate strength amazed me...his gentle 
          but firm hand...so much like yours...amazed me even more for one so 
          young...and his understanding that i could not submit to him....but 
          only bottom for him...totally blew my mind...he knew that my submission 
          was to you..and he knew how total and complete that submission was...as 
          my head rested in my pillow...i reached for yours and breathed deeply...the 
          scent of your cologne still lingering on the pillowcase....and my heart 
          just ached for you....but you would be home in the morning...i clutched 
          your pillow tightly to me....my body on fire and needing release...a 
          small little groan escaping from me as i rolled over and drifted off 
          to sleep...</p>
        <p>Thanking the powers that be that time goes by so fast when you're sleeping...a 
          smile crossing my lips as i woke the next morning..still clutching the 
          pillow next to me ..my body still burning to cum...but the uppermost 
          thing in my mind was you coming home.....the emotions running rampant 
          thru me..did i live up to all that you had set out for me to do? a little 
          nervous but the elation of seeing you again and being in your arms once 
          more overriding every thing else at this moment...i knew that even if 
          you felt you had to punish me...you would embrace me and kiss me when 
          you first saw me...and oh how i ached for your touch again...</p>
        <p>I slipped into the kitchen and turned on the coffee pot....and then 
          tapped on Miles door...opening it a bit and peeking in as i softly told 
          him it was time to get up and we had to leave in an hour...grinning 
          as he rolled over and his massive morning hard on poked up from the 
          covers...but not even that could excite me right now..my mind was focused 
          on you ..quickly showering and then putting on your favorite outfit...my 
          black leather skirt...fitting tightly around my hips but flaring out 
          around the hem...a low cut scoop neckline red sweater...black hose and 
          black heels...no panties on as i grinned wickedly..and then hurridly 
          drinking a cup of coffee and taking one with me.....Miles already ready 
          to go ....slipping into the passenger side of the car ..the drive seeming 
          endless to the airport...</p>
        <p>I could barely contain myself as we waited at your gate....and as soon 
          as i saw you i ran to you and just held you close..kissing you all over 
          your face and then finally brushing against your lips...whispering how 
          much i had missed you as your arms came around me and slid down to cup 
          my asscheeks.....pressing my heat into you as i softly whimpered into 
          your mouth....not caring what the people around us thought...a white 
          woman openly almost raping a black man in the middle of the airport...your 
          breath hot against my cheek as your whispered.....you little slut...you 
          didn't wear panties today....i laughed outloud and just kissed you again...and 
          then you took my hand and walked over to Miles....shaking his hand and 
          then embracing him ...i took your bag and followed behind the both of 
          you....my heart soaring at just the nearness of you again as the two 
          of you walked and talked...</p>
        <p>I slid into the back seat of the car as you slipped behind the wheel...positioning 
          myself so that whenever you looked into the rear view mirror you would 
          catch a glimpse of my smooth shaven soaking pussy...quitely listening 
          to the both of you talk on the drive home....and then grabbing your 
          bag as you pulled into the driveway...quickly opening the door for you 
          and holding it open...then slipping in behind the both of you....</p>
        <p>The both of you heading to your chairs as i made more coffee and brought 
          out a light breakfast of toast and fruit...then noticing that you had 
          slid the cushion between the both of you...i drifted silently to my 
          knees....aching to be at your feet...but knowing there was a couple 
          of more things to be done before you allowed that ....</p>
        <p>And then the strong gentle voice of Miles drifting to me.....&quot;angel...you 
          know what to get for me&quot;...i smiled up at him ...rising immediatly 
          and getting the paddle and the crop....and as i was handing them to 
          him he pulled me over his lap....pulling up my skirt and i heard his 
          soft chuckle with the discovery that i was not wearing any panties...i 
          saw him lay the paddle and crop to the side ....and both of his hands 
          started to slowly caress my ass cheeks...spreading them apart as his 
          finger teased along the opening...pressing up against my tight little 
          hole and then pinching each cheek hard..a soft little gasp as i began 
          to squirm on his lap...i knew my wetness was dripping onto his pants...and 
          i could tell that was even turning him on more....and then a soft blow 
          of the paddle...warming my skin with a nice little glow..and then another 
          soft blow on the other cheek..his hands caressing after each blow and 
          his fingers sliding down to my cunt lips...and then each blow getting 
          a little harder.....the redness rising on my ass....and the heat spreading 
          down to my pussy lips...i knew i was soaking wet now...and he turned 
          me over on his lap...spreading my legs wide....the juices coating my 
          thighs...and he just grinned....and then he reached for the crop...running 
          the handle over my tits.....across my nipples...and then bending down 
          to suck one into his mouth as the crop landed on my cunt....i moaned 
          and arched up into him....his teeth biting down hard on my tit now...and 
          his voice soft but firm...you can't come slut...and then another powerful 
          blow on my cunt...my body was shaking and my hands were balled into 
          fists...i didn't know how much more my body could take before betraying 
          me in spite of my best efforts not to cum...and then Miles suddenly 
          grabbed me around the waist....lifting me with him as he bent me over 
          his chair....i could hear him undo his zipper and then with no warning 
          he rammed that huge cock deep into my ass...my screams filled the rooms 
          as i gripped the arm of the chair tightly...my legs were trembling and 
          i was fighting desperately not to cum...my ass cheeks burning and aching....my 
          pussy throbbing from the crop and his assulting fingers....and now his 
          cock powerfully driving in and out of my ass...my head started to spin 
          and i knew i was close to the point of no return....but i looked over 
          at you ...my anchor...and i regained control of my body...if only for 
          an instant...and it was at that instant that i felt his cock throbbing 
          in my tight ass....and then he pulled out of me and with a loud groan 
          shot his cum all over my ass...i immediately thanked him for using me...for 
          cumming on me....and then i dropped to my knees and cleaned the cum 
          from his cock and balls...he softly stroked my cheek and told me how 
          pleasing i was to him and he could see now why his cousin was so proud 
          of me...i smiled up at him and thanked him for his praise and then he 
          dismissed me to go get cleaned up...i looked over at you and couldn't 
          read your expression at all..my heart sank as i went to the bathroom 
          and cleaned up and changed clothes again...it was now late afternoon 
          and time for me to get the dinner ready for our guest tonight..</p>
        <p>You came into the kitchen and talked to me while i was preparing the 
          meal...and i told you about the guest we were having....the final test..his 
          ability to seduce a sub and make them his...you nodded your approval 
          of my plan and then went to get a shower and a nap...both of you napping 
          as i went about making dinner and getting everything ready for tonight....placing 
          a cushion by each chair now....and setting the dining room table...gently 
          waking both of you up and serving you something to drink..and then the 
          soft tap on the door..i had noticed the curious look on Miles face when 
          he saw two cushions in the living room...i turned around and winked 
          at you as i asked Miles to please get the door...and there she was...her 
          name was jackie..and the electricity between them was umistakeable....</p>
        <p>After Miles had regained his composure a bit..something that she would 
          never notice...but we both did as we exchanged knowing glances...i quickly 
          went over to her and gave her a quick hug...taking her coat and hanging 
          it in the hall closet...and then turning and introducing her to you...i 
          whispered in her ear and told you both to go make yourself comfortable 
          in the living room...and jackie and i both carried out steaming plates 
          of food to the dining room table....she was so attentive to all of Miles 
          needs....and i watched carefully as she continued to refill his drink...to 
          hand him whatever he asked for..her tone always soft and respectful...after 
          dinner once again she joined me in clearing the table and rinsing the 
          dishes and stacking them in the dishwasher...when we got back to the 
          living room both of you were listening to music ....smoking cigars and 
          drinking a glass of wine....i quietly slid to my knees on the cushion 
          beside you....and jackie following my lead did the same next to Miles...the 
          look of amazement on his face that she was a submissive warmed my heart..i 
          watched as he quietly slipped a collar around her neck and then leashed 
          her...the talk between them intimate and low as we also began to talk...it 
          was a beautiful evening...i layed my head on your thigh and you ran 
          your fingers thru my hair...and then Miles rose from his chair..jackie 
          crawling behind him to his room...the look on her face one i knew so 
          well...the look of only wanting to please...of wanting to give of herself 
          totally...i nodded at her as she passed us and gave her a little wink....and 
          then i looked up at you...welcome home my Master....</p>
        <p>I grinned up at you as jackie was crawling behind Miles to his room...knowing 
          this was his first sub...and i was pretty sure this was her first real 
          experience with a Dom...but they seemed so perfect for each other..both 
          tall...slim...her flaming red hair...long and cascading down to her 
          shapely little ass...her eyes a soft clear blue...and his striking good 
          looks...a perfect couple ...i could sense the sexual tension between 
          them and the way she looked up at him so adoringly it was obvious she 
          was quite taken with him...</p>
        <p>I turned around in your arms and kissed you tenderly...and then reached 
          for your hand and led you to the bedroom...our lovemaking savage and 
          hungry that night....your cock invading every part of my body ....and 
          then finally collapsing into your arms...tears streaming from my eyes 
          as once again you had taken me deeper into my submission to you.....you 
          whispered softly that tomorrow we would test Miles....and i would critique 
          jackie...knowing she had another day off so that wouldn't be a problem...checking 
          off in my mind the extra toiletries we kept in the bathroom for unexpected 
          overnight guests ...and thankful that jackie and i were about the same 
          size and my clothes would fit her...and then drifting off to sleep in 
          your arms...turning in the middle of the night sometime as we always 
          do ...my arms draped over your waist with my hand wrapped around your 
          cock....</p>
        <p>We had been up for quite some time when jackie came out of the bedroom...she 
          looked tired but sated...that look on her face of a woman well used 
          as i motioned to her to join me in the kitchen.....you were practicing 
          your trumpet so i knew it wouldn't be long before Miles woke up as well...jackie 
          and i talking softly...telling her that i would like to see how well 
          she had done in submitting to Miles since she was such a brand new submissive...not 
          mentioning that you would be evaluating Miles at the same time....she 
          smiled shyly at me ...thanking me for my help and i just hugged her.....i 
          ran to the bedroom and gathered up a new hairbrush....toothbrush...and 
          everything she would need for her morning routine..choosing a pair of 
          red lace panties and matching bra...a loose flowing dress that would 
          hug her curves enticingly ...and then took them all out to her...telling 
          her there was a bathroom off of Miles room...which i'm sure she already 
          knew anyway...</p>
        <p>Miles was just sitting down at the kitchen table as she came back to 
          the bedroom...her skin with that soft glow that only belongs to a 20 
          year old..scrubbed free of makeup now..and her hair was hanging wet 
          down her back...but she was stunning .....even before Miles could ask 
          she had the coffee pot in her hand was pouring it into his cup..and 
          then slipped next to him at the table....drinking her own coffee...and 
          i left them to talk....knowing there was much they had to discuss....and 
          feeling that connection between them...i smiled softly to myself..and 
          quietly slipped behind you to kiss the back of your neck..</p>
        <p>The day was pretty much pretty chore free for the both of us...and 
          for Miles and jackie too...we had already planned on getting chinese 
          delivered later tonight....so it was just a lazy day...thankful you 
          had the day off today as i needed the closeness of you after you were 
          gone..my fingers running over my collar again and tracing over the small 
          stone...my heart leaping once again in the fact that i was yours...</p>
        <p>And then you rose from your chair...putting away your trumpet and walking 
          over to your chair in the living room....glancing up at me ...immediately 
          bringing you a glass of wine and your gold cigarette case and lighter...then 
          drifting to my knees in front of you...smiling up at you as you hooked 
          the chain to my collar and whispering thank you....and then you motioned 
          Miles and jackie in.....Miles stretching out his long legs as he leaned 
          over to you....the both of you whispering quietly to each other and 
          then Miles nodding ...jackie already kneeling at his feet....but the 
          both of you were talking so quietly that we couldn't hear what you were 
          saying...i nodded my approval at jackie...and smiled reassuringly at 
          her....i saw her look with envy at the collar and i reached over and 
          softly squeezed her hand....knowing she had no idea how hard i had worked 
          for this collar from you....</p>
        <p>We exchanged glances between us as the both of you rose from your chairs......and 
          then both of you carrying long six foot black boards back into the living 
          room...bending down and placing the wood screw in the center creating 
          an X...and then placing the slanted boards into the platform that Miles 
          had brought in...the ankle and wrist restraints bolted into the painted 
          black wood.....hooks down the back of the boards for chains and ropes...i 
          scooted closer to jackie and explained that that was a St. Andrews Cross...and 
          then told her that you would be evaluating Miles as well as me evaluating 
          you..she looked at me nervously..her eyes darting around the room ...to 
          the St. Andrews....to Miles and then back to me..i squeezed her hand 
          softly and whispered...honey...if Miles does this right you won't even 
          know Master Lee and i are in the room....</p>
        <p>And then Miles looked over at her...his voice soft but firm...it's 
          time sweet one...i knew you were terrified...but i watched in amazement 
          as you rose gracefully and walked towards him...your eyes full of trust 
          as you approached him and silently drifted to your knees...spreading 
          your thighs wide as you had seen me do.......you had given me permission 
          to get off of my knees and unhooked the leash....and i sat on the floor 
          between your legs....leaning back against your chair..my hand running 
          idly up your calf...</p>
        <p>You dimmed the lights in the room and there were candles lit everywhere...a 
          circle of candles around placed around the St. Andrews...the light flickering 
          softly over the two of them...and then Miles reached down and gently 
          caressed her cheek....i could almost see the shivers going thru her 
          from his touch...and a smile spread across my face..he gazed into her 
          eyes for a long time before finally telling her to strip...she rose 
          immediately...her eyes never leaving his as she slowly started unbuttoning 
          the dress...letting the dress fall around her ankles and then daintily 
          stepping out of it....her eyes now lowered as she was aware of our precense...Miles 
          sensing her discomfort immediately......and gently stroking down her 
          back..leaning over and whispering reassuring words to her and completely 
          putting her at ease again......she lifted her eyes to him and smiled 
          at him....and then he told her to take off the bra..she did so quickly 
          ...and then Miles reached his strong fingers into that fiery red hair.....lifting 
          her gently but firmly to her feet..and then backing her onto the St. 
          Andrews...his eyes roaming over her as she stood there...i caught the 
          look in her eye and nodded to her reassuringly...and then his hands 
          gently stroked her body...touching every inch of her...not sexually...but 
          i knew that every touch was burning into her soul...both of his hands 
          caressing her right arm..extending her arm without her even knowing 
          it as he snapped the restraint on her right wrist....his finger sliding 
          under her panties and then both hands sliding up her left arm.....securing 
          the left wrist quickly and firmly....i could tell he was talking to 
          her and reassuring her the whole time..and i was so proud of both of 
          them at this moment...and then he leaned forward...flicking his tongue 
          over her breasts...circling the nipple and tugging at them...his hands 
          sliding down her sides ....her eyes now closed as we could hear her 
          softly whimper..then his tongue slipping between the cleavage of her 
          firm full breasts..trailing down her stomach and circling around her 
          clit...his tongue not quite touching it as his hands reached down and 
          he expertly restrained the right ankle...her eyes flew open for a second 
          but at that exact moment his mouth closed around her clit and i could 
          hear the deep moan escaping from her as he restrained her left ankle....and 
          then he stepped back....smiling at her and telling her how beautiful 
          she looked restrained for him ....</p>
        <p>He asked her what her limits were....and i was so proud of her as she 
          calmly stated them to him...and they then established a safeword between 
          them...he nodded quietly and slowly walked around her...from the back 
          of the St. Andrews he took a soft suede whip and a crop...showing them 
          to her and explaining them to her ...she agreed to both and then the 
          soft strands of the whip began teasing her nipples......brushing over 
          her softly....i could see her shiver...and then he leaned forward and 
          bit hard into the right nipple and then the left..we could see the wetness 
          shining on her thighs now ....and his cock stiffening in his pants...he 
          stepped back again and grinned at her .....and then slowly started taking 
          off his clothes....kicking them out of the circle and then standing 
          in front of her....stroking that huge cock and taunting her with his 
          voice..is this what you want slut...her answer almost a moan as she 
          whispered yes...and then he stepped closer to her...pressing his cock 
          against her stomach...i didn't hear you slut....is this big black cock 
          what you want...the need in her voice unmistakeable as she cryed out 
          to him....yes...ohhhhhh god yes....he grinned at her and leaned forward 
          to kiss her ...his tongue raping her mouth....claiming her lips as his 
          and i watched her body convulse from his touch...knowing she wasn't 
          accustomed to the lashes of even the soft suede whip he gently flicked 
          it over her breasts...just enough for a tiny little sting and she gasped 
          softly....and then he layed the whip to the side...i could see the relief 
          in her eyes.....but then he reached for the crop....looking up into 
          her eyes as he shoved the handle into her cunt...his voice taunting....and 
          this slut? do you wish this was my cock in you....i could see her hips 
          rocking on the crop handle ...and the muscles tensing in her body..her 
          legs were shaking hard in the restraints as he shoved the handle farther 
          into her..and then her moan of release...the instant she started cumming 
          he took the crop handle out of her cunt and tapped it lightly but firmly 
          over her clit....we could see her cum spurting from her even at a distance...and 
          then he walked over to her...releasing her from her bindings and holding 
          her closely to him...we could barely hear his comforting words of reassurance 
          before he shoved her on her knees and thrust his cock into her mouth...she 
          immediately began to suck on it...his hands wrapping in her hair and 
          guiding him up and down his cock...the little choking sounds as he trust 
          it farther down her throat......and then his loud moan as his cum jetted 
          into her mouth....taking it out of her mouth and spraying it over her 
          tits and stomach...running the cockhead over her lips as the last drops 
          sprang from him....he then dropped to his knees and held her tightly...stroking 
          her hair and whispering to her...</p>
        <p>We let them alone for a little bit...i turned around and saw that your 
          cock was stiff and i just looked up and grinned at you...winking as 
          i whispered....maybe you'll let me take care of that for you later Master...and 
          then turning around again....both of them dressing now and holding hands 
          as they came back to where we were...Miles sat in his chair again and 
          i got up from between your legs...motioning to jackie to come with me 
          as we moved a little off to the side...i hugged her tightly and told 
          her she had done wonderfully for her first time on the St. Andrews...but 
          that when Miles...or any Dom that she was with asked her to do something...to 
          acknowledge the request with a yes Sir if not collared to him.....and 
          a yes Master if that was her Master...i talked gently to her....reassuring 
          her continually....and then told her that when she looked to me for 
          reassurance she should have looked to him....that he is the one with 
          the power over her...and he is where he gets her strength...she nodded 
          softly...and then i mentioned about learning how to control her gag 
          reflex...and that would take time but she would eventually learn it...that 
          it was a matter of relaxing your throat muscles in such a way that you 
          could swallow any cock no matter how big it was...and finally i told 
          her about thanking the Dom for allowing her to cum...even if she wasn't 
          under any orders not to...but all in all she did wonderfully and that 
          these are things that are learned over time and after many scenes..i 
          put my arm around her as we walked back to you..the two of you now finished 
          talking as well.....and we both took our places at your feet...where 
          we both belonged...me at the feet of my Master and her at the feet of 
          her new Dom.</p>
