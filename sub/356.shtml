        <p> This story started about 1973 and I thought ended in 74 ,little did 
          I realize how wrong that was to be.<br>
          let me begin in '73 I went to a technical high school in a major city 
          and was not an &quot;A&quot; student by any stretch of imagination . 
          Few friends and less than that in potential lovers . Shy and not outgoing 
          in any way . but during school that changed I started to get more into 
          the jock shape and less nerdy looking , I was discovering a new found 
          sexual attraction of girls that was new to me , sure I'd seen magazines 
          and pictures of naked women , and had active fantasies about them . 
          But never the nerve to act , she approached me and knew more about me 
          than I thought anyone would , she knew my friends where I used to live 
          ,things I liked and disliked . she was average height and well built 
          girl , whom I got to know better and soon we were more together than 
          apart it seemed , I was 17 she was 15 and we were getting to be very 
          good friends , and even more ,there were times she hinted we should 
          get even closer and I thought that would be great . at some point we 
          started talking about maybe thinking about dating and steadies , all 
          the world seemed ours and I was deeply in love with her , although I 
          was never sure how serious she was . <br>
          well all such romances at that age are likely doomed to disappear as 
          lovers chase their dreams separate ways . but it hurt that day I'll 
          never forget Tuesday morning as school year was coming to a close in 
          about 2 months , I would act fast and ask her for a date that weekend 
          coming , but that would never happen , and the reason was she came to 
          school late , buzzed high as a kite on drugs , and she came to me and 
          dropped the biggest bombshell I'd ever had dropped on me . <br>
          &quot;Hi babe &quot; she slurred the words &quot;I've had the most wonderful 
          weekend ,......... Pam sue and me went camping....... with 3 boys from 
          the university .......or.....should I say men .........and I won't be 
          your girl........cause........ I fucked all 3 boys all weekend long 
          ........and I hope I'm pregnant &lt;HA-HA-HA&gt;<br>
          with that she turned and staggered away . Well needless to say it was 
          after being sent home and additional 3 day suspension . the following 
          Monday was back to business as usual around school until the lab course 
          came up I was not real happy about having her in all classed after that 
          which was only 3 but after the whole morning to think about it ... &quot;2 
          months or less only 3 classes a day I can live it down we can get through 
          the year&quot; I thought it would work. Well first class and it was 
          awkward for me , she went on flirting like normal , I ignored her for 
          Monday and Tuesday , but Wednesday was the day she came and demanded 
          to know why I was not interested in her flirting all of a sudden . and 
          she was mad . &quot;I thought we were going to be steadies , now you 
          wont even talk to me .why? . I thought for a moment and finally said 
          to her &quot; when you love someone as much as I loved you , I may not 
          have showed it in a way you recognized , but I did love you a lot more 
          than I can tell you . You only get one chance to rip out my heart and 
          you have succeeded and nobody else will get that chance again , so good-bye 
          , it was nice to have shared that with you&quot; I turned and walked 
          away as tears clouded my eyes .<br>
          last weeks of school dragged slowly as I had notes and messages delivered 
          to me by her friends ,were read and discarded and so it ended .</p>
        <p>Now today damn 27 years later you always think about your first love 
          and never really forget her I suppose , but I have moved on married 
          for 5 years now and a family .I was excited as I was hired for a position 
          on long haul transport . I was hired and been doing training about a 
          week when I was called into dispatch . Big mike sat in the chair , &quot;got 
          a run for you sorry for the short notice widowmakers coming by in an 
          hour and her usual co drivers down with the flu . your if you want it 
          &quot;<br>
          &quot;wont step on toes will I ?&quot; I grinned <br>
          &quot;come with me&quot; he stood and walked to the lounge door <br>
          &quot;Widowmakers stopping by for a codriver any takers&quot; mike bellowed 
          <br>
          dead quiet , not a sound &quot; guess the new guys it&quot; he said 
          <br>
          &quot;widowmaker likes fresh meat:&quot; came a quip form the back<br>
          &quot; hang onto your wallet and yer balls&quot; came another <br>
          &quot;$200.00 says he don't make it back&quot; came a third <br>
          mike smiled and turned to me and said &quot;shes not that bad&quot;<br>
          &quot;here she comes&quot; said a voice, The rig pulled in and turned 
          in the yard all black and dark tinted windows <br>
          &quot;heres your papers, good luck&quot; mike was grinning <br>
          I started out for the truck and got to her door the window cracked open 
          &quot;I'm your help today&quot; I yelled <br>
          the window closed I went to the passenger door opened and climbed in 
          <br>
          as I fastened in for the ride she still looked out the window away from 
          me <br>
          &quot; bunch of shitless cowards&quot; she barked &quot;at least they 
          sent me a man&quot; she turned and smiled a very big smile . Those eyes 
          ,that face &quot; if you can put up with me for a week I'd like it ,Larry&quot;<br>
          &quot;well they are taking bets it wont be more than a day, Lori. but 
          I think we can go better than a day &quot; I grinned <br>
          we embraced and kissed deeply .she shoved it in gear as we started off 
          and I think I saw a tear in those eyes , I knew there where some in 
          mine .</p>
