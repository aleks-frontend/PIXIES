                          <td colspan="2" width="100%"> <!-- #BeginEditable "story" --> <p>That afternoon, David realized that although they had been feeding their passions, the had not yet fed themselves. He sneaked up behind Dee, who was standing on the deck of the cabin enjoying the view of the Mexican scenery. She was so totally immersed in the beauty of the sky that she never noticed David was standing there watching her. He watched her for a few moments, noticing how she would tilt her head from side to side, often shrugging her shoulders, reaching up to rub the right side as though it was bothering her. David thought to himself, hmm....I will have to take care of that for her later. He walked up behind her, wrapping his arms around her, asking her &quot;Darlin, would you care to go out to get something to eat tonight?&quot; She turned to him and said &quot;Dear, that is a lovely thought, but if you don't mind, could we just stay in tonight?&quot; &quot;I enjoy our time alone so much!&quot; With a content and pleased looked he gazed into her twinkling hazel green eyes, and said &quot;Darlin, for you, anything!&quot; He gave her a quick kiss as he smacked her lightly on the ass, turned around, and swiftly disapeared into the cabin.<br> Wondering exactly what he was up to, she followed him into the cabin to find him in the kitchen, already busy with getting a meal for them! She stood there, watching his manly frame find his way knowingly around the kitchen. Her gaze fell upon the strong handsome features of his face. He caught her stareing at him, and she felt the blush rise to her cheeks. He stopped long enough to give her a kiss on the cheek, and said &quot;Now Dee, you just go relax, and I'll have something ready in a few minutes.&quot; <br> Gladly she obliged, and went into the living room, and plopped down in the beautiful Aztec pring love seat. She tilted her head back resting it against the sofa, and relaxed there waiting for David. She smelled the aroma of the fresh fruit, and before she could open her eyes, she felt the brush of a strawberrie against her lips as she looked up to see David laughing. She smiled and ate the strawberrie. David said &quot;come on hon, let's eat.&quot; <br> They went out on the deck into the beautiful moonlit evening to enjoy their meal. They talked quietly as they ate, and David noticed that Dee didn't touch the strawberries. Perhaps she didn't like strawberries, he thought to himself. He wondered!!<br> Dee said &quot;thanks for the lovely meal hon&quot; and just as quickly got up and disapeared into the cabin, telling him she would be right back. He sauntered over to the oversized lounge chair and settled in. Much to his suprise, D (that was her nickname to him) came back with a dish of whipped cream in her hand!! He thought....hmmmm......maybe secretaries aren't so boring after all!! She said to him &quot;You are not the only one full of suprises&quot; as she gathered the berries up along with the cream, and moved to sit by his side. <br> David watched as she dipped a berrie into the cream, and deliberately licked the berrie in a teasingly sort of way. She gazed at him intently as her tongue worked around the berrie. He was enjoying this so much! She rubbed the berrie acrossed his lips, popped it in her mouth, and ate it as she straddled him on the chair and licked the cream from his lips.<br> His hands moved over her as she kissed him deeply, tracing his sillouhette in the soft moonlight. Reaching behind her, he unzipped her dress, and slipped it over her head, to find that she had nothing on underneath it.<br> His lips found their way down her body, where they came to rest upon her firm and hard nipples, suckling them as she tilted her head back in the moonlight. Pushing him back, she pulled his shirt over his head, and kissed her way down his bronzed chest. Unbuttoning his pants she found his hardness there, and took it in her mouth. She heard David softly moan &quot;Oh D, your lips feel like silk on my throbbing cock. His fingers entwined in her hair, as he gently guided her head up and down on his shaft. He watched as D's mouth worked it's magic, her tongue licking it from the tip to the bottom of his balls, and back up. She suddenly moved down on it and David moaned &quot;oh gawd D.&quot; He could feel the cum wanting to explode, but not yet he thought. He pulled D up to him, kissing her neck as he smelled the jasmine in her long strawberry blonde hair. He picked her up, and carried her to the bed, laying her on her belly. He began to massage that sore shouler, for he hadn't forgotten about it. D said, &quot;Hon you spoil me so much!&quot;<br> David rolled her over, kissing her thighs, and he spread her legs as his mouth found the wetness that tasted like pure honey to him. D moaned as he entered his fingers into her while he used long, slow licks across her clit. D could feel the warmth begining to flow inside her as she pulled his blonde hair, stopping him, asking him to make her cum like he did earlier that day, for no man had ever made her have and orgasm that way before. David teased her saying, &quot;oh baby, did you like that?&quot; D replied by taking his cock and guiding it inside of her as she moaned out in pleasure.<br> David moved gently inside of her, wanting her to feel pleasure, because he knew that she had suffered so much pain in her past. He kissed her softly, reassuring her to relax, that he would not hurt her. She said, &quot;I know that David.&quot; He pumped in and out of her as her hips moved to meet him, so she could feel all of him in her. They rocked together, building to more intensity, until they both climaxed together and fell exhausted in each others arms.<br> David held her close as she lay on his chest, softly kissing his neck. He told her &quot;D, you are safe here with me.&quot; She smiled at him with her eyes and said, &quot;I know that babe. Tonight I sleep in the arms of an angel.&quot;<br> <br> one intense lady<br> craz_1_99@yahoo.com</p> <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> </font></b></p> <!-- #EndEditable --></td>
