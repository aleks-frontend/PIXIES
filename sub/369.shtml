        <p> When Michael finally looked at his watch it was 20:45. He knew that 
          he should call his wife but he also knew that he wouldn't be able to 
          tell her what time he would be home and he just could not stomach another 
          hysterical row. Carol needed to realise that he had an agenda. He wanted 
          to be a partner in this legal firm within 2 years and to do that he 
          figured he needed to be working the 70-75 hours he generally worked 
          every week. Of course, a workload like this meant sacrifices and their 
          sex life had been an early casualty. At first she seemed to be able 
          to cope but these last few months she had seemed increasingly more neurotic 
          and paranoid. Michael knew she was prone to acting neurotically but 
          he put this down to her first marriage, which had failed miserably. 
          Why, he did not know, she had never fully disclosed the ins and outs. 
          All he knew was that she had been treated badly.<br>
          But it had all came to a head this weekend when Carol had accused him 
          of having an affair with his secretary, Amanda. He supposed she had 
          a right to be suspicious. Amanda often stayed late with him at the office. 
          She was quite a bit younger then his wife and although Carol was a fine 
          looking woman, some would say a classical beauty, Amanda was vibrant, 
          full of energy and oozed sex appeal. She shared Michael's love of working 
          out and the two of them would often go for a lunch time work out together 
          at a gym near the office. Michael needed to train. It was his one way 
          of releasing his excess adrenalin. However, this was something he knew 
          Carol didn't understand and he constantly had to reassure her that he 
          did not go to the gym just to ogle at women in leotards. He found it 
          highly convenient to go with Amanda but, of course, this just caused 
          more rows.<br>
          His train of though was interrupted as Amanda entered his office and 
          placed some case papers on his desk. Even though he was tired the sight 
          of her firm yet rounded figure in her fitted suit was able to stir some 
          excitement in him. He quickly banished these thoughts from his mind.<br>
          &quot;You should really get off home, Amanda,&quot; he said letting 
          out a long sigh &quot;you don't want to be a sad old git like me.&quot;<br>
          Amanda flashed a smile that Michael just knew had broken a dozen hearts.<br>
          &quot;Oh I'm ok. I've no plans for tonight.&quot;<br>
          &quot;Yes but all work and no play&#133;. Well you know what I mean.&quot;<br>
          &quot;Hmm, that works both ways, you know.&quot;<br>
          Michael sighed again and rubbed the bridge of his nose &quot;Yes I know.&quot;<br>
          &quot;I'll tell you what,&quot; Amanda had now perched on the corner 
          of his desk and was leaning forward offering him an embarrassingly good 
          view of her cleavage &quot;why don't we both stop what we're doing,&quot; 
          she paused, maybe too long &quot;and pop across the road for a drink.&quot;<br>
          Michael had jumped to conclusions and flushed bright red, he was also 
          off guard.<br>
          &quot;Ahem, ok&quot; he managed to croak out. </p>
        <p>Before he had time to change his mind Amanda had thrown him his jacket 
          and virtually dragged him to the nearest pub.<br>
          They were onto their third drink when he finally started to relax. The 
          conversation had inevitably turned to Michael's marriage troubles.<br>
          &quot;She doesn't seem to realise that I'm doing all this work for us. 
          It'll only be for another couple of years and we'll be on easy street 
          but all I get is hassle. &quot;Why are you working so late?&quot; &quot;You're 
          not working this weekend again?&quot; blah blah.&quot; Michael affected 
          a nasal whine to emphasis his wife's remonstrations.<br>
          &quot;Well, Michael there's a fine line to be drawn. Women need some 
          attention.&quot;<br>
          Michael hadn't even heard Amanda. He took a large gulp of beer and swallowed.<br>
          &quot;She thinks we're having an affair. In fact she's convinced.&quot;<br>
          &quot;Oh really?&quot;<br>
          &quot;I pleaded my innocence,&quot; Michael said raising his eyebrows 
          &quot;and I think she finally believed me.&quot; <br>
          Amanda looked at her watch and flashed him another heart stopping smile 
          &quot;Well, I think we'd better finish these drinks and go back to the 
          office.&quot;</p>
        <p>They might have only had three drinks but they had been drunk quickly 
          and both were feeling a little tipsy as they returned to the office 
          building. As they entered the corridor leading to his office Michael 
          thought he recognised a faint perfume that was lingering in the air. 
          He sniffed, but now all he got was Amanda's scent and he dismissed it. 
          They strolled up the corridor toward his office.<br>
          &quot;You still seeing&#133; what's his name? Phil?&quot; he enquired 
          making small talk.<br>
          &quot;No, I think we out grew each other.&quot; Amanda replied<br>
          &quot;That's strange,&quot; Michael was ignoring her &quot;I thought 
          I'd left my office light on.&quot;<br>
          &quot;Cleaner's probably turned it off.&quot;<br>
          &quot;Hmm yeah, sorry what were you saying about Phil?&quot; Michael 
          opened his door letting them both in. The perfume he had almost recognised 
          was much stronger now but before he could place it the door was shut 
          behind them and he heard the key turn. Someone must have been waiting 
          behind the door.<br>
          &quot;Who's there?&quot; Michael's voice cracked.<br>
          The office was illuminated as the light switch was thrown.<br>
          &quot;Well, well, how cosy.&quot;<br>
          &quot;Jesus, Carol what the fuck are you doing here?&quot;<br>
          Carol ignored her husband's question.<br>
          &quot;You two been having fun?&quot; the inquiry was loaded with sarcasm.<br>
          &quot;We've been over the pub for a drink,&quot; Michael had regained 
          enough composure to notice Carol's appearance &quot;Why are you all 
          dressed up? And what are you doing here, Carol?&quot;<br>
          Carol was, indeed, dressed up in a fitted suit, that Michael hadn't 
          seen before and looked suspiciously expensive, with a white silk blouse. 
          Her hair and make up were immaculate and probably the work of a professional. 
          Michael was already thinking about next month's credit card bill. Carol, 
          however, was still ignoring her husband's inquiries. She moved away 
          from the door towards the chair behind Michael's desk. Michael caught 
          her arm as she passed.<br>
          &quot;Carol what's&#133;.&quot; his question was stopped dead by Carol's 
          icy glare.<br>
          &quot;Take you hand off me now.&quot;<br>
          Michael retracted his arm and decided to ask no more questions. There 
          was a heavy, tense atmosphere in the office that was making him extremely 
          uncomfortable.<br>
          Allowed to go on her way, Carol sash hayed , almost, to the chair and 
          sat. She crossed her legs seductively and despite his tension Michael 
          noticed her skirt ride up slightly and that she was wearing stockings.<br>
          &quot;So, what was it to be? A little drink to get you in the mood, 
          before coming back here to fuck over this desk?&quot; to emphasise her 
          question Carol put her hand on the desk as if to test it for stability.<br>
          Michael was grinning now. He couldn't help it, he always did when he 
          was nervous.<br>
          &quot;Darling, whatever you think is going on, well, it's not.&quot;<br>
          &quot;Do you think this is fucking funny?&quot; Carol's voice had risen 
          a couple of octaves<br>
          &quot;No, no. Look, let's just get you home where we can talk, eh?&quot; 
          Michael looked deep into his wife's eyes and held them,<br>
          &quot;Er, I think I'd better go.&quot; Amanda spoke for the first time.<br>
          Carol broke away from Michaels gaze &quot;You're not going anywhere, 
          sweetheart.&quot; She sneered.<br>
          &quot;Sorry, domestics just aren't my scene.&quot;<br>
          Amanda moved to the door and turned the knob. She stood with her back 
          to them.<br>
          &quot;Can you unlock the door please Carol?&quot;<br>
          &quot;Like I said you're not going anywhere.&quot;<br>
          &quot;Look Carol just unlock the door and let Amanda go. Then we can 
          sort this all out.&quot; Michael's hands were out in an imploring gesture.<br>
          &quot;Fuck off Michael. It's gone beyond sorting out.&quot;<br>
          &quot;This is ridiculous,&quot; Michael was losing patience. He started 
          towards the door.<br>
          &quot;I have a spare key anyway.&quot; He said more to Amanda then Carol.<br>
          There was a rustling of material behind him.<br>
          &quot;Stop what you're doing.&quot;<br>
          He ignored her and was reaching into his pocket for the spare key.<br>
          &quot;I said stop.&quot; This was followed by the sharp metallic click 
          that Michael recognised from so many films and TV shows. He turned slowly 
          and found himself staring down the barrel of a cocked snub nosed revolver. 
          His mouth gaped.<br>
          &quot;Yes it's a gun, Michael, yes it's real and yes it will kill you.&quot;<br>
          There was an audible intake of breath behind him as Amanda turned and 
          surveyed the situation. She stuck her fist in her mouth to stifle a 
          scream.<br>
          &quot;What are you going to do?&quot; Michael said. He could feel Amanda 
          trying to cling onto his side and he moved away.<br>
          Carol was looking up to her left as if in contemplation<br>
          &quot;Well, I thought I'd let you 2 love birds fuck for one last time 
          before shooting you both in the face.&quot;<br>
          Michael's knees sagged. In her present state of mind his wife was capable 
          of anything. He knew he had to use all the skills learnt in his profession 
          to get himself out of this. He opened his mouth&#133; and nothing came 
          out.<br>
          &quot;Scared are we? Can't speak? Good. I didn't want to have to listen 
          to your bullshit anyway. Now let me have a good look at what's getting 
          you hard these days.&quot;<br>
          Michael instinctively moved away from Amanda who had somehow managed 
          to hide herself behind him. She was left on her own staring at her feet. 
          Carol looked Amanda up and down in an exaggerated leer.<br>
          &quot;Hhmm, sexy little bitch, looks like a good body too. But you'll 
          have to strip off so I can get a better look.&quot;<br>
          Amanda's head snapped up &quot;Wha..&quot;<br>
          &quot;I said STRIP!&quot; Carol jabbed the gun toward her for emphasis.<br>
          Amanda looked from the gun to Michael. Michael shrugged feebly.<br>
          &quot;I'm waiting.&quot; Carol said impatiently.<br>
          Amanda slowly unbuttoned her jacket and stopped.<br>
          &quot;Come on I haven't got all day.&quot;<br>
          Amanda removed her coat and dropped it to the floor.<br>
          &quot;Now the blouse.&quot;<br>
          Michael could see that Amanda was on the brink of tears but she unbuttoned 
          her blouse and removed it anyway.<br>
          &quot;And the skirt.&quot;<br>
          She reached behind her, undid her skirt and smoothed it down over her 
          hips. She was resplendent before Carol in bra, panties and hold ups.<br>
          &quot;Very nice. &quot; this time Carol's admiration was genuine. &quot;Why 
          don't you help her take her bra off, Michael?&quot;<br>
          Michael was still transfixed by the gun pointing at him.<br>
          &quot;I said, why don't you help her take her bra off, Michael?&quot; 
          <br>
          Michael was jolted out of his trance.<br>
          &quot;Please Carol..&quot;<br>
          &quot;Do it Michael. You know you want to.&quot;<br>
          Reluctantly Michael moved behind Amanda and fumbled clumsily at her 
          bra.<br>
          &quot;Having a spot of bother?&quot; Carol asked sarcastically &quot;That's 
          very much unlike you.&quot;<br>
          Finally Michael undid the clasp. He moved the straps off of Amanda's 
          shoulders and she shrugged her large breasts free.<br>
          &quot;Great tits. I can see why you like her Michael. Wouldn't you like 
          to be sucking on her nipples right now?&quot; Carol stood and walked 
          around the desk the gun still trained on the couple. She perched on 
          the edge of the desk. &quot;I'm not gonna tell you to do it twice.&quot; 
          She levelled the gun at his head. He quickly bent forward until his 
          lips brushed against Amanda's left nipple. It was hard and erect. Poor 
          cow must be scared stiff thought Michael as he allowed the nipple to 
          enter his mouth. Despite his predicament he felt his cock stiffen. <br>
          &quot;That's it suck it hard Michael.&quot;<br>
          Michael felt Amanda's breath quicken as he fulfilled his wife's order.<br>
          &quot;Now the other one.&quot;<br>
          He moved over to her right nipple and sucked it into his mouth.<br>
          &quot;Does that feel nice, Amanda? Do you like my husband sucking your 
          nipples?&quot;<br>
          Amanda groaned. This time Michael could not tell if it was from fear 
          or pleasure.<br>
          &quot;Is your cock getting hard, Michael? Take off your clothes and 
          let me see.&quot;<br>
          &quot;Carol please.&quot;<br>
          &quot;Stop fucking me around and get a move on.&quot;<br>
          Michael clumsily took his clothes off until he was stood in just his 
          boxers. They failed to conceal the hard on he now had.<br>
          &quot;C'mon off with the shorts, let me see that cock.&quot;<br>
          He rolled his shorts off over his erection with no little effort.<br>
          &quot;My, my we are nice and big. It's been a long time since I've seen 
          that used for anything but pissing.&quot; Carol leaned forward and flicked 
          the head of Michael's cock with an elegantly painted fingernail. The 
          whole shaft quivered.<br>
          &quot;I bet you love sucking on this big cock don't you Amanda? I want 
          you to show me how you love it. Get on your knees.&quot;<br>
          Amanda promptly knelt so that Michael's cock was swaying inches from 
          her face.<br>
          &quot;Now suck it, bitch.&quot;<br>
          Amanda pursed her lips and took the head of his cock into her mouth 
          sucking gently.<br>
          &quot;Now lick it up and down.&quot;<br>
          She trailed her tongue along the length of his cock from the head to 
          his balls. Michael groaned and closed his eyes.<br>
          &quot;Now suck him hard.&quot;<br>
          Amanda resumed sucking him this time more vigorously. Small moans escaped 
          from her mouth. Carol's hand instinctively moved to her own breast and 
          she felt the nipple stiffen under the silk of her blouse.<br>
          &quot;I bet you want to taste her sweet pussy, don't you Michael?&quot;<br>
          Michael let out a soft mumble. Carol leaned forward and grabbed a clump 
          of Amanda's hair. She forced her mouth further down the length of his 
          cock then brought her face close to the other woman's.<br>
          &quot;Take your knickers off and lie down.&quot;<br>
          Amanda almost reluctantly let go of Michael's cock and obeyed. She lay, 
          with her knees bent before Carol, who placed a hand on each knee and 
          spread them wide.<br>
          &quot;I can see your pussy is nice and wet, spread it open, let me see 
          your clit.&quot;<br>
          Carol turned to Michael.<br>
          &quot;I wanna see you eat her pussy, Michael, and suck her clit.&quot;<br>
          Michael knelt between Amanda's legs and looked at his wife who indicated 
          for him to proceed with the gun. He lent forward his mouth touching 
          Amanda's pussy. She indeed was wet, very wet and very sweet. Despite 
          his trepidations he commenced eagerly licking along her pussy lips.<br>
          &quot;Spread yourself wider.&quot; Carol voice was thick with desire.<br>
          Amanda pulled her lips wider making her erect clit stick out to almost 
          a centimetre. Michael encircled it and started sucking greedily. Carol 
          grabbed the back of his head and pushed his face further into Amanda's 
          pussy.<br>
          &quot;That's it eat her pussy.&quot;<br>
          Carol put the gun on the floor and unbuttoned her own blouse. Her hand 
          found her nipple and pinched it until it was hard. She quickly picked 
          the gun back up when Michael raised his head from between Amanda's legs.<br>
          &quot;You're gonna fuck her now Michael.&quot; Carol stood and walked 
          behind the desk retrieving the chair and wheeling it back out to the 
          front of the desk. She sat in the chair with the gun in her lap.<br>
          &quot;I want you on all fours Amanda, in front of me and I want you, 
          Michael, to fuck her hard from behind.&quot;<br>
          They promptly arranged themselves into position. Michael nudged the 
          head of his cock into Amanda's cunt. It was hot and soaking and almost 
          seemed to suck the rest of him in. They both let out audible sighs as 
          his cock slid all the way in.<br>
          &quot;Does that feel good?&quot; it was unclear whose Carol's question 
          was directed at. She'd put the gun back on the desk and was now spreading 
          her own legs. She hitched her skirt up and Michael could see that although 
          see had stockings on she had neglected to put on panties. He could also 
          see that she was wet as her middle finger snaked down through her trim 
          bush. She sighed as she found her clit and tapped it lightly with her 
          finger then making circular motions. Her finger continued on its journey 
          and delved deeper inside her pussy. She then brought the finger to her 
          mouth, sucking and licking the wetness off, relishing her own taste.<br>
          Her eyes locked onto Michael's. <br>
          &quot;Do you like fucking Amanda's pussy?&quot; she had resumed playing 
          with her own as she asked the question.<br>
          &quot;Yes.&quot; Managed Michael.<br>
          &quot;Can you see how wet my pussy is?&quot; Carol now had two fingers 
          inside her and was vigorously frigging herself.<br>
          &quot;Oh yes.&quot;<br>
          &quot;Wouldn't you like to see your wife get eaten out by your secretary?&quot;<br>
          &quot;Oh God yes.&quot;<br>
          Amanda seemed to baulk at the suggestion and Carol reached for the gun.<br>
          &quot;You're gonna eat me bitch and do it well.&quot; She rested one 
          hand on the gun and beckoned Amanda with the other. The couple shuffled 
          forward a few feet until Amanda's head was between Carol's legs. Carol 
          grabbed the back of her head, pulling her face into her sopping pussy.<br>
          &quot;Lick my clit.&quot; Commanded Carol.<br>
          Amanda's tongue reached out, flicking the top of Carol's clitoris, before 
          her whole mouth encircled it and sucked it in. Carol drew in breath 
          sharply.<br>
          &quot;Ohh that's good, you know what you're doing. Fuck her harder Michael. 
          The harder you fuck her the better she'll lick me.&quot;<br>
          Michael responded by increasing his speed. His cock felt on the brink 
          of bursting and he struggled to keep control, wanting the spectacle 
          to go on for as long as possible. Amanda's moans and gasps were now 
          muffled as her face was pushed further into Carol's wetness. Her tongue 
          probed deep inside Carol's cunt. <br>
          &quot;That's it fuck me with your tongue.&quot; Carol's head was now 
          lolling back in ecstasy, her eyes closed, &quot;Suck all my juices,&quot; 
          her head snapped forward and she grabbed Amanda's head with both hands, 
          grinding her pussy into it.<br>
          &quot;Oh God yes, that's it, I'm gonna cum all over your face.&quot; 
          Carol bucked and writhed as she showered Amanda with her spendings. 
          Her frenzy subsided. But only slightly.<br>
          &quot;I need your cock inside me now, Michael.&quot;<br>
          Michael felt Amanda pull away from him and move aside. He walked forwards 
          on his knees until his cock was this time at the lips of his wife's 
          pussy. He slid straight in and he felt the walls of her cunt spasm around 
          him. Amanda bent her head forward taking one of Carol's nipples in her 
          mouth, her hand found the other woman's clit and strummed it in time 
          to Michael's thrusts.<br>
          &quot;I can't take much more,&quot; stammered Michael, &quot;I'm gonna 
          cum.&quot; <br>
          With that Carol put her hands on his chest and pushed him back upright, 
          his cock reluctantly leaving her warm pussy. His disappointment turned 
          to delight as Carol slid off the chair and sank to her knees in front 
          of him taking his quivering member in her mouth. Amanda joined her on 
          her knees and grasped Michael's cock at the base, wanking it into the 
          older woman's mouth. Michael's knees buckled as he felt the first wave 
          of orgasm. His cock shuddered and almost exploded inside his wife's 
          mouth. He saw both her cheeks bulge and her eye's at the shock of so 
          much spunk. Carol drained every last drop before releasing his spent 
          dick and clamping her mouth over Amanda's. The two women entwined tongues 
          and exchanged his fluids. <br>
          The three of them seemed to collapse at once into a satisfied heap. 
        </p>
        <p>It was Carol that broke the post-coital slumber. She jumped up quickly 
          and Michael feared the worse but she put the gun into her bag, gathered 
          up her clothes and hurriedly let herself out of the office. Michael 
          crawled across the floor and poked his head out of the door just in 
          time to see his wife disappearing into the Ladies at the end of the 
          corridor.<br>
          He turned and flopped back down, his back resting against the door. 
          He let out a long breath of air.<br>
          &quot;Jesus,&quot; he said to the ceiling &quot;I told you she was convinced 
          we were having an affair.&quot; He could feel Amanda watching him.<br>
          &quot;Listen, Michael although that was an experience, it's not something 
          I want to repeat. I think it would be best if I resign.&quot;<br>
          &quot;No, no,&quot; Michael shook his head, &quot;there's no need, besides 
          didn't you like me fucking you? Wouldn't you like me to fuck you again?&quot;<br>
          Amanda snorted, &quot;I don't think so. You really don't realise what 
          you've got, do you?&quot;<br>
          Michael looked dumbfounded.<br>
          Amanda sighed &quot;I'm gonna go and talk to Carol and try and convince 
          her that there's nothing between us.&quot;<br>
          She grabbed her clothes and walked to the door. Michael stood to let 
          her out but caught her arm.<br>
          &quot;Will you be ok? She's still got that gun.&quot;<br>
          &quot;Oh I think so.&quot;</p>
        <p>Carol was re-doing her make up when the door of the Ladies opened and 
          Amanda walked in. The younger girl strode straight up to Carol, took 
          her face in her hands and kissed her long and deep. They finally broke 
          away from each other.<br>
          &quot;Fuck, that was some scene Carol. Sometimes I think you're too 
          wild even for me.&quot;<br>
          &quot;Fun though wasn't it?&quot; said Carol wistfully &quot;did you 
          see his face when he saw the gun? A picture.&quot; <br>
          &quot;I know, I had to put my fist in my mouth to stop myself laughing. 
          He really thought you were gonna shoot him. That is a bloody realistic 
          toy.&quot;<br>
          Carol produced the gun from her bag and made mock shooting noises. They 
          both giggled. Amanda finally spoke &quot;You know he actually does want 
          me as a bit on the side.&quot;<br>
          &quot;I figured that, that's why I know he's not worth it. Have you 
          resigned?&quot;<br>
          &quot;I have the letter in my bag, I'll leave it on his desk before 
          we go. You're definitely going to leave him?&quot;<br>
          Carol nodded, &quot;I wanted to give him one last thrill before going. 
          It hasn't been all bad you know.&quot;<br>
          &quot;I know, but anyone else would have just give him a normal shag 
          for old time's sake, but not you Carol.&quot;<br>
          Carol laughed and grabbed Amanda in her arms.<br>
          &quot;But that's what you love about me isn't it?&quot;. </p>
