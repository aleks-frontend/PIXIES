I don't really judge a man by how handsome he is, but by how much fun it would be to rock his world. I think about the guy with the suit and tie and how I could convince him to spank me, and I think about the rough looking biker and how I could make him beg me to take off my panties. I even look at the women and think about how they would react if I walked up to them and said &quot;I would love to lick your pussy.&quot;<br> Sometimes I take the fantasy even further when I wear my favorite yellow skirt without any panties. Fox example, I once walked into a shoe store and nearly killed the clerk who was helping me try on shoes. You would think he never saw a perfectly shaven pussy before. He looked young, so maybe he never did. I went home that day and used my thickest dildo thinking about how he was going to be thinking about me and playing with himself. Kind of like a star cross orgasm you know?<br> But once, I actually decided to go out and sleep with a total stranger. I didn't tell my husband, I didn't even tell my closest girlfriends. I woke up the other morning, took a nice long bath (making sure to shave extra close) and after my hair was done, I dressed to kill. No I didn't put on a really short skirt, or tight jeans. Instead I opted for a nicely conservative gray skirt and blazer. I looked like a CEO for a fortune 500 company, except I'm pretty sure that they wear panties to work.<br> I found a small Deli near a large group of office buildings and waited for my 'lunch' to arrive. I didn't take too long, maybe 15 minutes, before I spotted the man I was going ravage walking in the front do. He was 30-something, dressed in business casual, and alone. I think what got me so excited about him was his 'average-American-guy' look. I also loved the way her carried himself. Very confident, but not cocky, and he moved like a dancer stepping lightly into the building.<br> As he was giving his order to the waitress he caught me staring at him. Normally I am painfully shy, but that day I was not about to back out of my plan because I was too afraid to make eye contact.<br> Instead of turning away and acting like a little schoolgirl, I just smiled and mouthed the word &quot;Hello&quot; to him. He stood up and came over to my table and asked if he could join me for lunch. I didn't even finish saying &quot;of course&quot; before he was making himself comfortable across the table from me.<br> We exchanged names and some small talk about where he worked and then he asked me what I did for a living. I thought about making up a lie, but caught myself and told him that I run an adult web site. He didn't even blink at my response before telling me how cool he thought that was. Was this guy unshakable? I wanted to put him to the test right then and there so I asked him if he would like his own private show, on the house.<br> That worked. He nearly choked on his Pepsi. When I stopped laughing at this I told him I was serious and that he should take the afternoon off from work. Two seconds later he was on the phone and plopping down money for a lunch that hadn't even been delivered to his table yet. You want to talk about feeling special? This guy was changing his entire schedule for me.<br> I got in my car and followed him back to his place, the whole time wondering if I was taking this too far and if I should just turn left somewhere and get lost. But I'm the kind of girl who will stick to something once my mind is made up. And I decided I was going to fuck that guy. What was his name again anyway? Bill, Bob, something with a B?<br> Whatever his name was he lived about 20 minutes away from the Deli and in an average suburban house. We pulled around back, to avoid the neighbors watchful eyes (I'm guessing) and came in through the garage entrance. Just looking around the house I knew he was married because everything was picked up, and men don't usually hang curtains on every window. What I didn't know was that his wife was home waiting for us.<br> The first thing out of her mouth was, &quot;Do you always try to fuck married men?&quot;<br> Oh shit.<br> Then she smiled and got in my face, lips touching, and said, &quot;Well, if you are going to fuck THIS married man, you are going to have to go through me first. Literally.&quot;<br> I instantly dropped to my knees in front of her, smiling, eyes closed and face up. How quickly the tables had turned on me. I thought I was going to have this stud all to myself, and he pulls this on me?<br> Groovy. I could handle that!<br> She shoved my face into her still-clothed crotch, and I began working my mouth like there was a pussy there. Licking and sucking, breathing my hot breath through the fabric of her jeans, I kept my hands down at my sides felt her husband pull them behind me and handcuff my wrists together. I didn't think I was in any danger but I was still scared. I guess it showed in my performance, because my head was pulled back by my hair and his wife looked at me, almost lovingly and said, &quot;You are going to be treated very well, don't worry. It's just that Ben likes to tie people up, and I'm too claustrophobic to let him. You wanted to be his fantasy girl right?&quot;<br> Ben! That's what his name was. Of course I wanted to be his fantasy girl, but more then that I wanted him to be my fantasy man. Then again, women are always a big part of my fantasy as well. I nodded my head yes, and Ben's wife took two steps back and began to undress in front of me. She looked about 32, with short brown hair, and glasses. Her breasts were small, very perky, and topped with the extremely hard nipples perfect for sucking. She turned around for me when she took off her jeans and I could tell she worked out every day because her ass was perfect. Not to big, not too small, and perfectly round, I have don't have doubts that you could bounce a quarter off her ass.<br> Ben must have been getting undressed too because the next time I noticed him he was setting in a chair fully erect and watching his wife dominate me. His cock was about 6 inches long, and very thick and ended with an even thicker head that I hoped I would eventually get to suck.<br> My attention was drawn forward again towards his wife when she pressed my face into her crotchless panties and ordered me to suck her pussy. I leaned into it and gladly busied my tongue and mouth with the task of bringing her to orgasm. I could feel her hands on the back of my head directing my face to lick her where she wanted and when she wanted. She would pull me into and out of her croctch almost as if she were fucking my face. I was having a hard time catching my breath but knew that it didn't matter. She had to cum before I would get another chance to rest. I felt her pussy get wetter and wetter with every lick, and heard her breath louder each time I sucked her clit in between my lips. She didn't make a sound until my oral pleasuring finally brought her to her first orgasm and she let out a very loud, low moan that must have lasted a full minute.<br> Ben walked over and asked his wife, (Tony) if I passed, to which she breathlessly nodded her head and pushed my over on my back. The handcuffs started to dig into my skin a little bit, but I was doing ok, and ready for whatever was going to happen next.<br> Ben kneeled down between my legs, spreading my dress up high on my theighs <br> and began to rub his cock on my clit, like he was fingering me with it. I knew I was already wet, but this made me so moist I could actually feel it drip down between my legs. Tony asked me if I was ready to be fucked by her husband and I actually heard myself should yes. I didn't say it, I shouted it. I was ready, and I wanted him in me.<br> I had my first orgasm that night when Ben shoved the entire length of his cock into me all at once.<br> I began to flop on the floor helplessly as the orgasm tore through ever fiber of my body and my pussy clenched down on Ben's cock. He waited until my orgasam started to stop and began to pound me, hard and slow. Take his cock out very slowly until the head was just barely touching my pussy lips and them slamming the whole thing in, slapping his balls against my ass.<br> As I was starting to get back into the groove of things Tony climbed on top of my face and told me to make her cum again. Talk about lucky! I had a thick cocked man in my pussy and a hot woman on my face using me for their pleasure. I felt Tony reach down my top and start pinching my nipples and kneading my tits. Ben must have got a similar idea because I felt bigger hand reach up under my shirt and cup my breasts.<br> Ben began to grunt with every stroke and Tony was really grinding herself into my face hard -when I felt, without any warning Ben empty his balls into me with his deepest stroke of the night. Then I heard Tony's low moan again, only this time it turned into a high pitched shriek at the end of her orgasm, which sent me way over the edge for my own second orgasm. I didn't even feel the handcuffs cut into my skin as my entire body convulsed.<br> When Tony got off of my face, Ben leaned over and kissed me on the lips, cleaning his wife's juices from them. Helping me stand up he told me that he hoped I had a good time. I couldn't even answer I was so winded, but he knew my answer was yes.<br> After the handcuffs were removed, Ben walked me to the door and told me to come back whenever I wanted. I never did go back. I don't think it could have ever been that good again because I didn't expect his wife to be home, and I didn't expect to lose control of a situation that I had started. I still go out looking for that more random fucks, but Ben and Tony, I'll never forget those two.<br> kathleen@hotmail.com / www.kathleenpics.com</p> <p></p> <b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> </font></b><!-- #EndEditable --><br>
