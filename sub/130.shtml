                          <td colspan="2" width="100%"> <!-- #BeginEditable "story" --> <p> I see this ad in the paper SKYSEX !!! It says: We will fly you all around your city, Bed and drinks included, for two hours $250.oo Gee my baby would love that! Sex in the sky? So I call the number and book us in, for tonight at 7:00 pm.The guy on the phone says. We also have other daytime flights. We take you out to a remote area with a landing field below. You and your woman jump out with nothing but and hardon and parachutes! We've seen some women giving head on the way down and when the guy cums as we were circling them and the sun was just right. Wow his cum in the sky looked liked spider webs... Also in awhile we'd land and pick you up, all your clothes still in the plane. Lots of people do it?</p> <p> Ahh no thanks, maybe someday. We'll just take this fly around the city thing. &quot;Okay.&quot; the man replies. That afternoon you come home and we hug and kiss at just inside the door. it's always good to see you, Your a little shy but always very sexy to me. I tell you about what I have planed. You smile and say. &quot;Great! But I wanna take a shower first.&quot; I tell you I already did. You were saying I smelled so clean but I wish I could have been here for that shower you took! Smiling, as you go off for the bathroom, are hands holding as long as possible as you walk away. You come out looking very nice, as you give me a flash of your body, smiling. As this image of hot pink underwear sticks in my brain as your closing the black dress up, I notice it has 50 buttons going all the way up the front! &quot;Diane we only get two hours up in the sky!&quot; I told her.</p> <p> I See you bending over letting me see your great cleavage and that super smile, Saying not to worry Dave, you pull a zipper all the way up, telling me the buttons are only decorasion Dave. She's so good! I'm always fooled by her. So we go out and get in the truck, I tell her I heard about this new Chinese restaurant , and we need to eat before we go flying, So we get to the restaurant and walking in, it's a really large room with water everywhere and maybe thirty islands with different sized tables in the middle of the islands and bamboo trees everywhere and curved redwood bridges with Chinese styled handrails connecting all the islands together, Very cool looking place.</p> <p> We sit down and you ask me to order for you, so I order white steamed rice covered with steak and shrimp and sweet and sour sauce over it, two plates of that and they have fresh oysters covered with a light batter and deep fried. They come with their own dipping sauce as the oysters are on long sticks, I love oysters! And a pot of hot tea, with those neat little Chinese cups.</p> <p> We hold hands and eat and talk about each of our days we had had. After filling our tummies, we get fortune cookies as we keep trading our cookies not knowing who picked what cookie, as we finally settle on one of the two cookies we received. The cookies both have the same message! (You will experience something wonderful soon.) Those Chinese are so smart. I really do like them though, and their food! We get back in the truck for our trek to the airport.</p> <p> Your sitting right next to me and I lean over and unzip your dress part way down just to see if you are really wearing a hot pink bra, I thought I saw. And it is! It even unhooks in the front. I give you a nice long kiss before we leave the parking lot. Dark now and I turn on the lights and the overhead lights on the roof of truck after driving 15 miles we get to the airport, the man had told me where to drive to once there, we pull up to a blue and white striped twin engine plane.</p> <p> The trucks lights shinning on it, we see a door come down and open, a man in a tux comes out waving to us. I kill the lights and we climb out, I take your hand as you step down. The truck has steps on it's sides but still a long step down, and your in that tight black dress. The man comes to greet us, asking us if we were Dave and Diane? &quot;Yes sir.&quot; I reply, as you just smile at the man. We walk up in the plane as the man is telling us all about the plane and all they have to offer us. &quot;I am Gebbes and if you need anything just hit the button above the bed, I'll be right here, as I stay behind that door with the pilot. If your naked don't worry... I've seen it all. He replied.</p> <p> Yeah right! I'm thinking he would love to see Diane naked, he's not fooling me. In the middle on the plane there are two chairs facing each other with a small table in the middle and directly across is the same, with a picture window on each side, like we could switch sides to see out depending on the view down below. And at the back of the plane there's this really nice looking bed with black satin sheets and pillow cases, some kind of black and white fir bedspread.<br> I ask Gebbes. &quot;What kind of fir is that?&quot; He says, it's rabbit pelts sir.. Very nice I reply. As Diane sits on the bed to check it's firmness, and her fingers running through the rabbit fir. Gebbes tells me he's prepared the champagne on ice, that I had ordered the pink bubblely stuff. He says he'll come back here after we get in the air and open it and pour for us. &quot;Sounds good.&quot; I replied.</p> <p> Then the pilot comes out and says we're ready for take off, I'm Brandy your pilot and I hope you enjoy this flight, winking at Diane... The pilots a good looking tall Blonde with a captains suit and Short curly hair with black ribbons tied in her hair as they hang down farther than her hair, very cute look and really red lipstick very shinny. I'm wondering wow she ever learned to fly. They would flunked her just so she'd have to take the whole course again. <br> She's wondering if she'll ever get thru the golfing course she has been taking as her instructor is always standing behind her helping her with her swing, and every time she feels more, than she needs to improve her game. Anyway she and Gebbes go in the front cabin closing the door. I ask you what you think so far? As you sit down in one of the white and black spotted leather chairs buckling the seat belt, Saying. &quot;I like this. I would do anything for you hon your wonderful.&quot; I smile back at your face buckling up also, the engines are starting up.</p> <p> I take your hands in mine, We kiss as we get to sit pretty close facing one another. The table between us is teak wood with rounded corners and sides very nice. We feel the plane start rolling, slowly working it's way to the runway... And zoom the plane is air born in know time. We're looking out the window at the city lights. Brandy lays the plane in a long slow turn. To give us a really nice view... Then Gebbes comes out not saying anything as he pops the top on that bottle pouring us long tall glasses of champagne, He says enjoy the flight when you hear a soft beeping sound by the bed it means we'll be landing in 10 minutes, for your convenience and we'll be in the air for one hour and 50 minutes from now so do enjoy, as he leaves closing the cabin door.</p> <p> We watch the view and drink that bubblely and slowly dance our way to the bed as there is soft music comming from somewhere? We make the best love we ever have, as Brandy slow rocked the plane almost as if she were helping us make love, she was great! And having you in those black satin sheets eating you out at 20,000 feet was wonderful...</p> <p> <br> By Dave Evans: Comments to <a href="mailto:evansinno@zianet.com">evansinno@zianet.com</a></p> <!-- #EndEditable --></td>
