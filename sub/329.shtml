              <p>CHAPTER FIVE </p>
              <p>
              <p> Black high heels, not too high but narrow and sharp, curved 
                and held Esclava's feet. The sheer and light blue stockings slid 
                smoothly up her legs, coyly ending somewhere above the tight curves 
                of her dress, apparently made from stretch fabric, black and full, 
                hiding and exposing her shape at one and the same time. Her blouse, 
                in contrast, was loose and flowed around her torso like some shinny 
                blue liquid or oil, blown by the wind of her movement. The sense 
                of fullness swelling of the silk hinted at the soft curve of her 
                breasts. Several of its top buttons were open, revealing her cleavage 
                and sometimes her bra, depending on how she moved. 
              <p> But her face was coated with garish colors. Painted like a whore, 
                or even the parody of a whore, a whore with no sense but plenty 
                of enthusiasm. It was the sort of make-up that left men with a 
                startled recollection of disturbed emotions and desires while 
                women would tend to smirk. Thick and wide eyeshadow, lips painted 
                red and wide.
              <p> I'd asked her to fetch me a drink and admired the promise of 
                her movements. &quot;It's the final night of your initiation, 
                and I for one hope that you can do all of what will be asked of 
                you.. If you can, then I'll have you stay the night with me, and 
                we'll see what tomorrow brings.&quot;
              <p> She lifted the hem of her skirt, and cupped her front with her 
                right hand. &quot;Please, Sir, I'll do whatever you like. Not 
                just because I want to please you, to show you the love that I 
                have for you, but because I am yours. Yours to do with as you 
                please. What you want, I want. What you say, I'll do.&quot;
              <p> &quot;Even if I told you to walk naked into a restaurant? To 
                eat a full meal with a roomful of strangers watching you while 
                I took photos? Even if I let a roomful of total strangers touch 
                you however they want? The women too? &quot;
              <p> &quot;Even then.&quot;
              <p> &quot;Well, we shall see, won't we? But I must say, this is 
                an auspicious beginning. You look lovely. Too lovely to cook this 
                evening, my Esclava, so we are indeed going out to dinner. Yes, 
                I want to show some others how lovely you are, and how lucky I 
                am.&quot; I knew she was thinking about what I'd just said to 
                her. I tossed off my drink and handed her the glass. She took 
                it into the kitchen. The look on her face was priceless when I 
                told her that I had a gift for her because I was so well pleased 
                with her. Pure delight and open gratitude, a look I'd often seen 
                in a dog's eyes. I handed her a small box, wrapped in red paper 
                with a black ribbon. With her head bowed, she opened it carefully.
              <p> Inside, a thin black leather collar curved in a spiral. The 
                clasps were chrome, and the leather soft. It closed with a small 
                padlock. &quot;I want you to 
              <p> wear this tonight so everyone will know that you are my pet, 
                my slave, my delightful Esclava. Here let, me help you. There, 
                now, wait, got it. I'll keep the key for you, my dear, since you 
                have no pockets. Oh, no, you'll not be needing to carry you purse 
                tonight. I'll take care of everything. That is what masters are 
                for. To take care of those who please him. See, here? I have a 
                leash to go with the collar. It clips here in front. If I tire 
                of holding it, you are to slip the handle loop over your wrist. 
                Do you understand?&quot;
              <p> There was no mistaking the meaning of the collar or the thin 
                rope of chrome that ran from her throat to the leather loop in 
                my hand. Even so, she followed me out of the building and on to 
                the street. She walked a few steps behind me, the chrome leash 
                a thin arc swaying between us. People stared openly and startled. 
                At one point, I slipped the leash over her hand and told her to 
                walk a dozen or so steps in front of me so I could watch the people 
                watch her.
              <p> We finally reached the restaurant that I had in mind. I had 
                taken the leash back from her and led her to a table. The restaurant 
                was full, small wrought iron tables pushed up close to each other. 
                I led her to one in the middle of the room that had only two chairs. 
                The tables around us were all crowded, and we had to push past 
                the other patrons to reach ours. This made certain that many people 
                noticed the leash on the girl and whose hand it was in. We sat 
                and waited for the waitress.
              <p> &quot;Sir?&quot; she asked.
              <p> &quot;Are you touching yourself?&quot;
              <p> &quot;Sir?&quot;
              <p> &quot;Are you touching yourself? You have been asked to touch 
                yourself whenever you talk to me. Are you touching yourself?&quot;
              <p> Her hand slid off of the tabletop and into her lap. A little 
                rustling and she looked at me again. &quot;Sir, I am touching 
                myself.&quot;
              <p> &quot;Very good. Then, what was your question?&quot;
              <p> &quot;I cannot remember.&quot;
              <p> &quot;That's fine. Then please drink up your glass of water.&quot;
              <p> I ordered for us both. Everytime the waiter refilled her glass 
                of water, I told her to drink it. While we ate, I told her the 
                plan for the evening. I'd invited a couple of friends of mine 
                over for a few drinks and laughs later on. She will serve the 
                drinks and the laughs. Her nipples hardened and thrust against 
                the material of her blouse. I commented on this and teased her 
                that the thought was sexy to her. She blushed and agreed. 
              <p> &quot;I want everyone I've invited over to have an orgasm before 
                the party is over.&quot; She nodded. &quot;I may have invited 
                quite a few men this evening. Perhaps my entire poker group to 
                play a different kind of poker. What do you think of that?&quot; 
              <p> She moved the hand in he lap again and said, &quot;I hope that 
                I will be able to please you and your friends.&quot; 
              <p> &quot;It doesn't bother you that I will give you in the most 
                intimate manner you can be given to total strangers for their 
                own amusement? I may even have invited a girl.&quot; I was surprised 
                at her reaction to that. She arched her back and gave a small 
                shiver, as though the thought were too much. &quot;Do you like 
                that idea or not? Would you like it if I were to bring along a 
                woman to give you to?&quot;
              <p> &quot;I don't know, Sir.&quot;
              <p> &quot;Well, perhaps we shall find out tonight. For right now, 
                let's finish our coffees and get on with the evening's entertainment.&quot;
              <p> &quot;Sir, I need to be excused to go to the bathroom.&quot;
              <p> &quot;No. Finish your coffee first.&quot;
              <p> She evidently needed to pee badly because she drank her coffee 
                quickly. But I wouldn't let her go until I had finished mine. 
                Such a pretty thing sitting there and squirming in her chair while 
                I slowly sipped my coffee.
              <p> &quot;Do you need to go badly?&quot; She nodded. &quot;Well, 
                then, you can go,&quot; I said as I drained my cup. She quickly 
                pushed back her chair and stood to go. &quot;But want you to use 
                the Men's room, not the Ladies.&quot; Her puzzlement wrestled 
                with her need. &quot;I can see them both from here quite clearly, 
                so will see which one you go into. Make sure it's not the Ladies.&quot; 
                Without speaking, she turned to leave. I watched her back as she 
                made her way through the crowd towards the two doors. To give 
                her credit, she paused only for a moment before pushing through 
                the Men's Room door. But then, after four glasses of water and 
                a cup of coffee, her need must have been fairly pressing.
              <p> She emerged, her cheeks glowing a bright red. Two men came out 
                after her, laughing between themselves. Only a few patrons had 
                noticed that she'd gone through the &quot;wrong&quot; door. Her 
                eyes blazed with what I wrongly took to be anger as she walked 
                back to our table.
              <p> &quot;How was it?&quot; I asked. &quot;How did it make you feel 
                to pee with the men?&quot;
              <p> Her hand disappeared beneath the table again. &quot;It made 
                me feel completely sexy.&quot;
              <p> &quot;Tell me about it. What happened?&quot; 
              <p> &quot;There were two men in there when I went in. I had to go 
                so badly that I couldn't wait to see their reactions. I went into 
                the last stall and sat to pee. It went on and on. The men gathered 
                outside of the booth to listen and joke.&quot;
              <p> &quot;Did you wipe yourself in front of two men? Did you speak 
                to them?&quot;
              <p> She nodded. &quot;And then they watched as I dressed again. 
                But it made me so hot and wet to be there that I gave them an 
                extra show by hiking up my skirt to straighten my blouse before 
                I left. I think they enjoyed seeing beneath my skirt.&quot;
              <p> &quot;I'm sure they did. Good girl. But now, let's get back 
                to my place so that the real fun of the evening can begin.&quot;
              <p> I paid and we left, her leash dangling from my hand. The walk 
                back wasn't that long. The streets were much emptier than they 
                had been earlier. Those who saw us looked as though they knew 
                what we were about. While we waited for one light to turn so we 
                could cross the street, I turned to her.
              <p> &quot;You look so nice here with me. Do you enjoy it? Do you 
                like being so obvious about your sex life in public?&quot;
              <p> &quot;Yes, Sir,&#133;&quot; she began, but I interrupted her.
              <p> &quot;You're not touching yourself. Didn't I tell you to touch 
                yourself everytime you speak to me?&quot;
              <p> She raised her skirt right there on the corner and gently placed 
                her palm against the curve of her sex.&quot; Yes, Sir.&quot;
              <p> &quot;Good. I just wanted you to be standing here for a moment 
                with your skirt hoisted for everyone who wants to look. That's 
                enough. Let's go.&quot;
              <p> We made it home soon. I deliberately ignored her for the rest 
                of the walk back to my place. On the way up in the elevator, I 
                gave Esclava a pill. She asked me what it was, but I refused to 
                tell her. &quot;It's a tablet I want you to take now,&quot; was 
                all that I told her. She took the tablet.
              <p> When we got inside, we found two pairs of shoes just beside 
                the door.
              <p> &quot;Hello?&quot; I called out. Joe and Jane, we'd agreed to 
                call them that, in the living room, watching the video I'd told 
                them would be in the VCR. I felt Esclava shudder as she realized 
                that they were watching the show she'd put on last night for me. 
                Her voice sounded clearly. &quot;Yes, I want to please my master's 
                friends. I will do whatever he wants and if he wants me to please 
                you, I will do whatever you want. Do you want me to be naked for 
                you? I am naked for you. I'm hot right now just thinking about 
                you, watching me, touching me, giving me your cocks to suck, entering 
                into me, making me thrash with your thickness, and scream and 
                squeal and come and come deep inside me.&quot; Her pants and squeals 
                showed clearly that she was about to come herself at this point. 
                &quot;Oh yes all of your cocks. I have room and desire for all 
                of my master's friend's cocks. I want you all.&quot; Esclava watched 
                their faces in horror. She knew that these perfect strangers were 
                watching her naked masturbation. She heard herself going on to 
                describe her routine for oral sex, and then the unmistakable slurping 
                and sucking. She knew the little face she made when he came in 
                her mouth and she also knew that they now knew what she looked 
                like too. 
              <p> &quot;You have pleased me greatly once again. Tomorrow night 
                will be the final test of your desire to serve me. I want you 
                to come prepared not only to cook dinner but also to spend the 
                night. If you can pass, then we need to talk about taking our 
                relationship to the next level. For now, bring your clothes here 
                and get dressed in front of me.
              <p> &quot;Come tomorrow night at the same time, prepared to do anything 
                and everything to please me. You'll have lots of opportunities 
                to prove your love to me. You do want to do that, don't you? Say 
                it.&quot;
              <p> &quot;Yes, I want to please you. I'm prepared to do whatever 
                you ask of me.&quot;
              <p> &quot;Even if I asked you to walk naked into a store and not 
                come out until you'd had two strangers sign your tits?&quot;
              <p> &quot;Yes, even if you asked me to have strangers sign my tits. 
                If it pleases you, I will do it.&quot;
              <p> &quot;You please me, Esclava, you do. Now kiss me once before 
                you go.&quot;</p>
              <p> The film ended, and they turned to us. &quot;Welcome, welcome,&quot; 
                I enthused. &quot;I see you found the film. Great stuff. Yes, 
                and this is the little lady you were just watching.&quot;
              <p> Joe stuck out his hand and shook hers. &quot;I feel like I know 
                you already.&quot; Esclava blushed but met his eyes. She couldn't 
                look Jane in the face however.</p>
              <p></p>
