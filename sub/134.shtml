So they walked on back there was this gal taking on any man for five dollars, in an arm wrestling contest! <br> Smokey had to try this lady out... He was a big black man very well mannered soft spoken but also very strong! He peeled his tee shirt and sat down across from the lady laying out a fiver... She said. &quot;Howdy mister, so you think your strong huh?&quot; &quot;Yes Ma'am.&quot; He replied. They locked hands she told him she works in an industrial plant for her dad, and that she was a welder! Smokey could feel she had a grip and a good arm. She had a nice smile looked like she could get along with anyone also looked like she had a lot of irish in her, real pretty red curly hair and a nice body.<br> They laid into each other starting out slow, after five minutes Smokey's arm started to shake his forehead was beading with sweat, she asked him if he wanted to give? He shook his head no.<br> Soon Smokey's hand was being lowered to the table top, and it hit hard finally... He said. &quot;Damm strong woman!&quot; She smiled at him. Smokey got up and went to the bar and bought her a beer, to show his good sportmanship... He invited her to come and sit with him and his friend, she said. &quot;She'd like that.&quot; giving Smokey a big smile.<br> They all sat down, she asked if they were betting men, Stoney said it depended. So she quietly said she would bet each of them fifty dollars that she could make them both cum in less than one minute... <br> They took the bet, after finishing their beers, she walked them to this big industrial plant down the street it was about seven in the evening, she had keys to a side door, the place was very quiet, nobody else there. They walked down a hall to a door that had a sign it read Annie, she unlocked the door and turned on the lights a big room like a shop. We walked across to another small room she open that door and the light came on. There was this machine in the middle of the floor.<br> She started taking off her clothes and asked the men to do the same, seeing her naked hot body made them both get a hard-on, she began to climb inside the machine so her head was out one side and her ass out the other it was all padded inside and she had a control pannel in her right hand some kind of remote, looked like...<br> She asked the men which wanted her mouth and the other get her pussy from behind the men choose their spots, Smokey wanted her sweet pussy and they got in place and she instructed the men not to hold on to the machine, because when she turns it on it will start spinning like a clothes dryer kinda! She told them she had a buzzer that will go off in one minute when the machine starts...<br> The men said they were ready burying their hard cocks in her at each end of her hot looking body... She started the machine and it started spinning, she tightened her ass for Smokey, and sucked down on Stoney's hard cock....<br> They were standing facing eachother as the machine began spinning faster! Their eyes wide their mouths open, yelling out. &quot;OOOOHHHHHH FUCK!&quot; They were both cumming in her so hard in a little over thirty seconds and the machine was slowing down... Annie kept sucking on Stoney and Smokey fucked her cum filled pussy while the machine stopped, as soon as it stopped the buzzer sounded, They both had her do them a little while longer, but they helped her out, she was so dizzy she looked drunk, but the men were both looking through their wallets for the right bills to pay the lady! <br> She said. &quot;Did you boys like my invention!&quot; They were both getting dressed,<br> saying. &quot;Jeezzz did we ever!&quot; She said. &quot;Do you know any other betting<br> men?&quot; By Dave Evans<br> Comments to: <a href="mailto:evansinno@zianet.com">evansinno@zianet.com</a></p> <!-- #EndEditable --></td>
