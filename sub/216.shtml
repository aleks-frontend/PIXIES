I got out and, after having obtained my bags and settled the fare, rather wearily slouched into the hotel and toward the front desk. It had been a long flight, after a long day at the office and I wasn't particularly happy about being sent on this last-minute trip in the first place. </p> <p>&quot;Alex? Is that you?&quot; I started a little, not expecting to run into anyone I knew this far from home. The voice was familiar and when I turned I recognized Shawn. We used to work together a couple of years ago and, I admit, I had a bit of a thing for him then. However, we were both happily married at the time and Shawn had two baby girls, so he was relegated to the status of masturbation fantasy. And I have to say, he was a particularly good one... though to this day I don't understand why. He's just a normal guy, 5 foot 8, dark hair and dark eyes, not overly muscled or anything. It must have been some reproductive instinct. A man becomes so much more attractive to a woman when she sees he's an excellent father (not to mention the virility implied by siring two offspring in rapid succession). </p> <p>We chatted a bit there in the lobby and found that we were still in the same line of work. We agreed to get together for a late business dinner then parted so I could get checked in and settled in my room.</p> <p>When I got to the room, the first thing I did was shower. I took that opportunity to shave my legs and underarms, then realized why I was bothering to do that. In the back of my mind, I had been thinking sex since the moment I saw him again. &quot;Well, you never know,&quot; I thought and I made sure I thoroughly cleaned my sex and my ass. By now, the water jets were starting to feel pretty good and I got another idea. I soaped up my vulva and the crack of my ass again and began using the razor to remove the light brown hair down there (which is, by the way, very delicate work when you're doing it by yourself and have to judge by sense of touch). When I was completely hair free, I rinsed off and got out of the shower. I grinned wickedly at my image in the bathroom mirror. It had been a while since I had shaved myself in this fashion. Hell, it had been a while since I'd had sex! I hadn't been with anyone since my husband and I split six months ago. I really didn't think that anything would likely happen later as Shawn was still married, as far as I knew. More than likely, I'd wind up alone in my room pleasuring myself at the end of the night.</p> <p>I put on some makeup. I have very nice ivory skin with naturally rosy cheeks; so I don't tend to over-do it. Just a bit of eye makeup to accentuate my large green eyes and a bit of lip pencil and gloss to highlight my well-proportioned lips. I blow-dried my long, deep golden blond hair and left it loose around my shoulders. I only had one dinner dress with me, a short black number with a deep V neckline. I choose a black push-up demi bra that had matching panties. My breasts are a 36D and the bra with the dress showed them off to advantage. I didn't bother with hose, as I have always hated the damned things and use self-tanner anyway. I still didn't really think I had much of a shot with Shawn, but I wasn't against stacking the deck a little, so to speak.</p> <p>When I met him down in the lounge, I could tell he appreciated the dress. He couldn't help looking me over from top to bottom, which gave me enough time to surreptitiously check out the affect my appearance was having on him. If I hadn't wanted him before, I certainly did now! What I saw stirring there definitely had promise. We sat down together in a darkened corner booth and ordered drinks. I don't think we ever got around to ordering dinner. We just kept talking and talking and had several more drinks. I was feeling pretty mellow and had pretty much given up on the whole idea of sex when Shawn said to me, &quot;Did you ever realize how badly I wanted to have sex with you when we worked together?&quot;</p> <p>I hesitated for a second before replying, &quot;Obviously not, or I would have done something about it. I mean, I was still married at the time so I couldn't have done much. But I would have had a lot of fun playing the role of cock tease.&quot;</p> <p>Shawn choked a bit on his drink at that comment and laughed. From there the conversation took on decidedly sexual overtones. We attempted to continue our conversation reminiscing about the old days working together, but inevitably the conversation returned to our past sexual attraction. I admitted that I had fantasized about him quite a bit. He asked me what my fantasies were like. I was a little embarrassed, but I told him that I used to think about having sex with him in just about every possible position and orifice. Location and ambiance were unimportant in my fantasies, just lots of hard, raunchy sex. When I finished giving him the erotic details, he exhaled, like he'd been holding his breath during my little discourse. &quot;My wife would never do anything even remotely like what you just described. I do still fantasize about doing a lot of those things and I used to put you in the starring role in those fantasies. But do you want to know what my favorite sexual fantasy is?&quot; At my nod, he continued. &quot;It's a bit neanderthal of me. But I have always dreamed of physically overpowering a woman and stimulating her sexually until she wants me in spite of herself. When we were working late together, I'd think about locking the office down and taking you against your will. Only by the end, it wasn't against your will and you were giving as good as you were getting.&quot; </p> <p>&quot;And just how good was I getting?&quot; I stared directly into his eyes. Shawn leaned in toward me and dropped his gaze to my mouth. Involuntarily, I licked my lips just second before his claimed mine. At first, our kiss was tentative. We explored the texture of each other's lips with brushes and nibbles and flickering tongues. Then the kiss deepened, our mouths hungrily locked together, tongues now performing that erotic dance that never failed to get me totally hot. Eventually, we had to brake apart and struggled to catch our breath. Somewhere during the kiss my hand had fallen to Shawn's lap and was resting directly on the bulge in his trousers. Then I noticed that his hand had slid up my skirt and was gripping my upper thigh, very close to my ass. &quot;Shawn. I think we should do something about some of these fantasies.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I can't actually get rough with you. It's one thing to fantasize, but...,&quot; Shawn replied.</p> <p>&quot;But nothing,&quot; I said. I explained to him the concept of a safe word. Sheltered little darling that he was, he wasn't familiar with the term. I explained that he could get as aggressive as he needed to in order to fulfill his fantasy and, if I wasn't into it or he went too far, I could say the safe word and he would know to stop. We agreed that we would both go back to our rooms and freshen up. In half an hour, he would come to my door and the game would begin. I asked him to make sure that no one was around when he came to the door, as we might want to start in right then.</p> <p>I returned to my room and took off my clothes. I took care of the physical necessities and washed up again. Combed all the hair spray out of my hair to make it soft and touchable. I put the black lace panties back on and threw on my nightgown. It was styled to look like one of those slip dresses in heather gray cotton with black lace trim. I had just finished preparing when the knock came on the door.</p> <p>I checked to make sure it was Shawn. Then I opened the door just a crack and said, &quot;Yes? What do you want?&quot; Shawn had apparently taken my advice to heart (making sure no one was around), because he pushed open the door with all his strength. I had to jump back to avoid being slammed into the wall. He lunged into the room and I darted away from him, running toward the phone. I picked up the receiver and dialed 911. But before anyone answered, he grabbed me from behind, pinning my arms to my sides. He pushed me onto the bed and straddled my back, trying to keep my arms pinned to my sides. Reaching over to hang up the phone, he disconnected the phone cable from the back and from the wall jack. By then, I had managed to wriggle my arms free and was trying to haul myself out from under him across the bed. But he grabbed both my arms and pulled them behind my back cruelly. He hesitated for a moment, as if waiting to hear me say the safe word. When I didn't and continued struggling, he quickly wound the phone cord around my wrists. His thighs straddled my buttocks so that his weight held me to the bed and I couldn't free my arms from the phone cord. I was actually trapped now and a bit nervous about how things would progress from here. I could hear him unfastening his belt and unzipping his trousers. I struggled to turn my head to find out what he was doing.</p> <p>He had removed his hard cock from his underwear and was stroking it slowly as he watched me struggle beneath him. I didn't want to drool because that would be out of character, but he looked succulent. About 8 inches long and 3 inches in diameter and he apparently kept himself trimmed (or had done it to please me, and it did). I turned my head away quickly, pretending I was disgusted by what I saw. </p> <p>Shawn shifted his weight back on my thighs and then brought his legs together between mine. He quickly pulled his trousers down over his ass to get them out of the way. Sensing that I had an opportunity to escape, I tried to come up on my knees and lunge across the bed. But Shawn was having none of that. He grabbed a handful of my long hair and wrapped it around his fist. He jerked my head back slightly and then put his hand around the back of my neck, still gripping a good chunk of my hair. Applying some pressure to my neck, he forced me to bend over. So now I'm on my knees, bent over with my face pressed into the mattress. I can't move without seriously pulling my hair. I could hear Shawn pulling off his pants with his free hand and kicking off his shoes. I could hear a metallic click and then felt his weight jostle the bed as he positioned himself behind me. &quot;Don't move,&quot; he whispered. And I did freeze when I felt cold metal against the back of my thigh. He moved the knife against my skin deliberately, bringing the blade up to the side of my panties. I could hear the fabric ripping and felt the tug as it gave way under his knife. He completed the process on the other side and tore my panties off.</p> <p>&quot;Oh my god,&quot; he said as he noticed my hairless state. I heard the knife hit the floor and suddenly felt his prick on my slit. He didn't enter me at first. He just rubbed the head of his prick all over my nether lips and my clitoris. Of course, I had been enjoying our little game myself and was already becoming wet with anticipation. As he continued to rub himself over me, I got more and more excited and the dampness between my legs increased. He tried to continue to stimulate me in the manner, but I had become so ready for him that the head of his prick accidentally slipped into my waiting warmth. I'm afraid I did break character then and moaned when he abruptly removed it.</p> <p>&quot;I knew you wanted this. Well, I'm going to give it to you, baby. I'm going to give you all of it.&quot; And with that he rammed his full length into me, his balls slapping hard against my mound. For a second I was too overcome with the sensation of him filling me so completely to remember that I should be fighting him. I could feel every ridge of him against my sensitive inner walls. I could even feel his heartbeat in the pulsing of his organ. Or maybe the pulse was mine. I couldn't tell at that point. Once I recovered a bit, I began struggling forward again until he was mostly out of me. At that point, Shawn pulled out, backed off a bit and grabbed my thighs, yanking my legs out from under me. I could feel him untying the phone cord and suddenly my arms were free. I was trying to push myself up when Shawn rolled me over and positioned himself between my legs again. I attempted to shove him off me, but he took hold of my arms and held them over my head. For several moments, he lay on top of me and looked into my eyes. I could feel his hardness on my belly, twitching between us. Then he kissed me roughly and said, &quot;I can make it good for you too, if you'd just let me.&quot; His lips brushed across the side of my face to my earlobe, which he gently nibbled. Then he moved down my neck, blazing a trail of hot kisses. My neck is extremely sensitive and my hips automatically rose against him in response. Shawn slid down slightly to allow his prick to nestle between my labia and started rubbing himself back and forth over the aroused area, all the while nuzzling my neck.</p> <p>I tried to block out the sensations. I really did. But soon my breath was coming harder and faster, until I was almost panting. I couldn't stop the little involuntary sounds at the back of my throat. Shawn picked up his pace against my clitoris and I could feel my pleasure building. I could tell it was going to be intense. I felt totally out of control and became frightened of what he might bring out in me. My head rolled back and forth. My body thrashed beneath him. All in a desperate, subconscious attempt to escape the sensations he was forcing on me. Unerringly, his shaft found its way back to my sensitive little nub. Shawn pulled his head back enough to look deep into my eyes to fully gauge the effect of his ministrations. The second after our eyes connected I went over the edge, my body convulsing with wave after wave of the most intense orgasm I'd ever experienced. </p> <p>As the first wave hit, Shawn plunged deep into my moist, hot passage and continued to pump away at me. I cried his name over and over, begging him to stop. I realized that, up until this point, I held myself back from experiencing too much pleasure during sex. I had always been in control of what I felt. I had no such control now and the sensations continued to wash over me until I thought I'd pass out from the sheer ecstasy. Finally, Shawn let out a loud yell and tensed above me. I felt his cock leap inside me and begin to flood me with his lust.</p> <p>He collapsed on top of me, his deflating prick still inside me. &quot;That was fucking incredible. Thank you,&quot; he sighed, then kissed my lips tenderly. I still had tears rolling down my cheeks, but I was coming back to myself now. I returned the kiss and murmured against his mouth, &quot;No. Thank you.&quot; Words seemed inappropriate beyond that exchange and Shawn sensed it, too. He rolled off me and reached over to turn off the bedside lamp. Then he drew me into his arms and, exhausted and extremely content, we both drifted off to sleep. My last conscious thought was: &quot;I can't wait to try some of my fantasies.&quot; But that's another story...</p> <p></p> <b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> </font></b><!-- #EndEditable --></td>
