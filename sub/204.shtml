It had been an especially hard night of aerobics and they were so tired they were not thinking about anything other than getting home. Neither of them had bothered to put their shorts back on over their tights and leotards. Without being aware of the fact, they had all eyes on them when they were walking home. Men and women both would look at them and why not they both had excellent bodies and were very attractive.<br> Going to the gym had become the thing to do for them. It not only kept them in great shape it also let them make new friends. Teri and Mo had just come out, so to speak. They were both lesbians. They had known it for a long time and had become each other's partner some years back. However, they were just now letting everybody else know, because both of them were up to some experimenting. One of their friends, that worked at the same company they did, told them about this certain aerobics class that had started up at the neighborhood gym. It hadn't started out to be for the gays only, but it had just sort of evolved to that. Nobody else at the gym seemed to mind.<br> Of course, there were always going to be the straight ones in the class that just knew they could change someone from being gay to being straight.<br> Everybody in the class just humored those people along; they really didn't mean anything by it. Nothing much had happened in class that night. Teri had made friends with a couple of women that had been there longer than they had &quot;Very nice, very attractive,&quot; Mo said when she pictured who they were in her mind. &quot;Don't get your hopes up yet, we didn't get around to talking about anything other than the way we were dressed,&quot; Teri told Mo. Nearing their house they saw a car parked in the driveway. Neither of them said anything until they were sure whose car it was. &quot;Shit,&quot; they said in unison, when they were close enough. It was two of the people they wanted to see least. John and John. Now what were the chances of being friends and having two men with the same name falling in love with them? Mo and Teri didn't know what the chances were nor did they care, they would just like them out of their lives. John and John had been in love with them for two years, now. Both of them knew that Teri and Mo were in love with each other. That never slowed them down, though. At least once a week they would be over at their house or once they even showed up at the gym wearing spandex bike shorts and crop top tee shirts trying to impress the girls. However, when they saw the others looking at them and trying not to laugh they stalked out never to return to the gym. They were nice enough guys, the girls thought, but they just couldn't get it through their thick brains that Mo and Teri would never change their lifestyles and start liking men.<br> Mo and Teri thought about not even going to their house but it was starting to cool off and take a shower and change clothes. They decided they couldn't avoid John and John tonight so they went on home. The guys were waiting in their car when they saw the girls walk up. &quot;What a shame,&quot; one said to the other while he was watching them walk up to the house. Two women who look that good dressed like that, and they love each other.&quot;<br> Teri and Mo walked past the car and waved to the guys to follow them into the house. It was the middle of September and they hadn't lit the furnace yet. However, the way it felt in the house tonight they knew that it would have to be lit soon. Maybe John or John could do it for them. John and John walked in behind them, grabbed a beer out of the refrigerator, and sat down to watch television. Which they noticed that it wasn't on when they sat down, so John asked Teri to turn it on for him. Mo turned toward them and rather sarcastically told them both that they would be such a catch for two lucky women. Neither of the two Johns caught the sarcasm in her voice, they just agreed with her.<br> Mo went to the bedroom, put a sweatshirt on over her leotard, and brought one out for Teri. Mo knew that both Johns could not keep their eyes off them especially when they were wearing their tights, so she purposely didn't want to hide anything under clothes or the boys might get disappointed. They all sat around drinking beer and watching television for the better part of the evening. John and John kept dropping little hints about going out with them that weekend but could see they were getting nowhere so they changed their strategy. They tried to convince Mo and Teri that they were considering a lifestyle change. The girls pretended they didn't know what they were trying to tell them. John and John got so mad that they finally blurted out that they thought they might be at least bisexual. Mo and Teri had to laugh at that one. They tried to explain to them that a person couldn't just turn being gay off and on like a light switch. They went back and forth arguing with each other for another hour before Teri announced that she was tired and going to bed.<br> Mo agreed so John and John knew that was their signal to leave. Before they did, though they begged the girls to give it some thought about going out with them. Mo and Teri said they would just to get them out of the house.<br> After John and John had left Mo and Teri took a shower and got ready for<br> bed. Teri had to clean up the mess that the guys had left before she could relax and go to bed. Mo did a load of clothes while Teri was cleaning up.<br> They were both tired by the time they got in bed. They both started talking about a way they could make John and John leave them alone for good. After coming up with what they thought were some good ideas they decided to sleep on it.<br> One of them forgot the next day was Saturday and set the alarm for work. Mo had to lay there for a minute and try to figure out what day it was after the alarm went off. She finally remembered it was the weekend and rolled over and gave Teri a tap on the butt and then fell asleep. They both woke up two hours later and lay there talking about what they could do to John and John. They came up with what they thought was a good plan, which, if everything would work out as planned, could be a very funny plan. In addition, it would push John and John to the limits in showing show if they really were serious about changing their lifestyles. Teri couldn't believe they were going to go through with this game they were playing with John and John. They didn't even like the two men, anyway. Teri had a suspicious feeling that Mo just wanted to see how big of fools they would let themselves become. What the hell Teri thought that suits her just fine.<br> Since it was Saturday, they decided to skip going to the gym. The got ate breakfast and went shopping. Mo never told Teri the full plan to get back at the boys, until they were on their way to the mall. When they arrived at the mall Mo went straight to the exercise clothes store. They looked at the tights and leotards and tried to imagine what the guys would look like wearing them. Neither of them could make up their minds, so the bought two leotards and two pair of tights each. The leotards just happened to be the thong style. Now all they had to do was call the guys and get them to come over later that night. &quot;That won't be too hard,&quot; Mo said, &quot;they would come over wearing diapers if we asked them to.&quot; &quot;Yeah, your right,&quot; Teri said, &quot;Hey, why don't we stop and get some lunch and have some drinks so we can work up some courage for tonight.&quot; &quot;Sounds good,&quot; Mo said.<br> They stayed at the restaurant longer than they had planned to. Moreover, they drank more than they planned to, also. They were both pretty loaded<br> when they walked in their front door. Mo had forgotten to call John and John from the bar so she had to do it now. &quot;At least try not to slur your words when you're talking to them, they'll know something is up,&quot; Teri told her, as she was about to pass out on the couch. &quot;Okay, okay your highness,&quot; Mo glared at her. She made the call and luckily caught them both at home.<br> By the time she got through laying it on thick and making it sound like they just couldn't miss out on an opportunity like this, that they were ready to come now.<br> Mo let Teri sleep while she took a cold shower and tried to sober up. She woke Teri up after she got out of the bathroom. Teri went in, took a long hot shower, and felt better when she came out of the bathroom. They had already decided earlier that they were going to dress in their tights and leotards, too. If that didn't do something to John and John nothing would.<br> Teri and Mo both like the way they looked and felt when they had those on.<br> They both became a little turned on when they saw each other like that. Teri leaned over and kissed Mo. Mo started to kiss back but then she remembered they didn't have much time before the two Johns came over, so she told Teri there would be plenty of time for that later.<br> Deciding to drink a beer, they had just popped the top when the doorbell<br> rang. Both of them chugged the beer and Mo went to let them in. Seeing Mo and Teri dressed like they were both of the guys simply smiled. &quot;Well,&quot; John said, &quot;why the sudden change of heart?&quot; Mo looked at both of them and said, &quot;we got to thinking of what you said about yourselves becoming gay or at least bisexual.&quot; &quot;Oh that, do you believe us,&quot; John's face began to turn dark read as he asked Mo. &quot;Let's just say we want to sit down and talk to you two about it before we get very far,&quot; Teri told them. Mo motioned them to sit down on the couch. They both positioned themselves on the couch where they could put their legs across the guys' lap.<br> &quot;Guys tell me why you think your turning gay and don't leave out anything,&quot;Mo said. They started telling the girls that sometime at the gym they would notice how good the other men were looking. And how they couldn't stop from looking at others in the showers. &quot;The guys that wear the running tights at the gym are the ones that really get to me,&quot; John said. &quot;And sometimes,&quot; he continued, &quot;we'll fool around a little after we get home, one of us will put on a leotard and tights and see how good we look.&quot;<br> Teri and Mo had to excuse themselves to go to the bathroom so they wouldn't laugh at the guys. On their way out of the bedroom they picked up the tights and leotards, they had picked up that morning for the guys to wear.<br> &quot;Well since you feel that way,&quot; Mo said, &quot;why don't you guys go in the bedroom and put these on and come back and show us how good you do look before we do anything else.&quot; John and John just looked at each other, helplessly, and took the clothes into the bedroom to put them on. When they didn't come out after about ten minutes the girls decided to walk on in the bedroom. When they opened the door, they saw both Johns standing in front of a mirror admiring themselves. Nevertheless, all the girls really noticed is how good the guys really did look to them. Mo and Teri couldn't believe it but they both like what they saw it was strangely exciting to them.<br> As soon as the guys heard the door opening they tried to hide but there was just no place, so they stood there with their arms hanging limp by their sides.<br> When they saw the looks on the girls' faces, they thought that Mo and<br> Teri were going to ask them to leave. They were suprised and a little shocked when the girls walked over to them and started looking at them more closely. Then it really made them snap to when Mo started adjusting Johns tights. He hadn't noticed when he put them on that they had seems in the back and she was just adjusting them. He looked over at Teri and she was doing the same for John. Suddenly all their embarrassment went out the window.<br> John and John went back out to the living room and sat cross-legged on the floor after they had made sure all the curtains were closed tightly. Mo and Teri stayed in the bedroom for a minute and talked. Neither of them could believe that they actually liked the way the guys were dressed. They knew that both Johns had good bodies, but they looked better than some girls did dressed in their leotards. Moreover, maybe just maybe they weren't lying about being gay or bisexual, because they sure acted like they liked being dressed as they were.<br> They went back out in the living room and found the Johns sitting in a Yoga position on the floor admired them for a minute and then joined them.<br> &quot;You<br> sure did a job on us tonight,&quot; Teri told her John while she stroked his<br> leg. She couldn't help notice that he had started moving a little as she<br> stroked his leg and strangely enough she started feeling her body responding also. She looked over at Mo and John and saw they were in their own little world, too.<br> Teri asked her John how long he had been dressing like this. &quot;Not long,&quot; he told her, &quot;I think I've wanted to for a long time but just never had the courage to do it until last week at the gym when I saw you and Mo doing those Yoga positions. That just really got to me. So John and I went to the store, bought some, and tried it out that night and we liked it.<br> It's still a little embarrassing in front of each other. &quot;Why,&quot; Mo asked her John. &quot;I think we're scared we'll do something with each other and I'm not sure that's what we want, yet&quot; John said. &quot;Let me tell you, from now on when your around us we want you both to dress like this and to be anyway you want to be, understood,&quot; Teri said. &quot;Yes ma'am&quot; John told Teri as he reached over and gently pushed her to the floor, &quot;anything you say, ma'am.&quot;<br> &quot;No!&quot; Teri told her John as she sat back up on the floor pushing John off her. She settled down and told them they would have to do more than talk to prove to them that they were actually gay. Mo suggested that they all go in the bedroom and talk some more. She went to the kitchen and came back with some more beer.<br> The guys tried and tried to talk the girls into believing they were actually changed men. They all went through another twelve pack of beer before Teri told the guys to prove it. John and John looked at each other. They didn't know what to do. They never thought Mo and Teri would be interested in seeing them together. The girls were betting that the guys had had just enough beer to try something. John told Mo and Terri that they would but it would have to be in the dark and that the girls couldn't say anything. Teri told them they would sit in the corner and not say a word.<br> She got up and turned the lights off and sat back down in the corner with Mo, resting her head on Mo's leg. The girls' eyes hadn't adjusted yet but they could here some movement on the bed. John reached out and touched the other John's crotch and could feel his erection sticking out through his tights and leotard. He let out a little sigh and then touched the other John's crotch. Before they knew it they were both moaning and groaning. Forgetting about anything else.<br> Mo and Teri walked out of the bedroom quietly. They weren't interested in what the men were doing. They walked into the other bedroom and laid down together and before long they had each other moaning and groaning. They finally fell asleep. When they woke up they opened the bedroom door where the men had been. They weren't there. Neither were the tights and leotards the girls had bought them. They didn't see John and John for another week and when the finally did see them they just waved. Teri asked Mo if she had noticed how close the two guys were walking together. &quot;You think,&quot; Mo said as they continued on. &quot;I don't know and I don't care,&quot; was all Teri said as the neared their house.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> </font></b><!-- #EndEditable --></td>
