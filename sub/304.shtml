            <td colspan="2" width="100%"> <!-- #BeginEditable "story" --> <p>Esclava arrived at my door exactly on time again. My doubts about her sincerity were almost gone, lessened by her amazing willingness. Dressed just the way I wanted her-all in sheer white, underclothes clearly visible, stockings around her legs and low pumps on her feet. My hands ached to caress her breasts as they thrust out against the filmy cloth of her dress, but that would not be in keeping with my game. No touching yet, not yet. No, tonight was for more looking.<br> &quot;Kiss me.&quot; Again she threw herself against me, and the intensity of her kiss surprised me. But I would not show her that, not until she had shown me a lot more. So I just stood there, mouth to mouth and tongue to tongue, without otherwise moving, without giving her the touch she arched towards me for. Her thickly made-up eyes closed as she received my tongue into her mouth. Just as suddenly as we began, I pushed her away. Off balance, never knowing if things were going to take a sexual or a domestic turn. Back and forth between these two. Slowly back and forth. Fucking with her mind, in more senses than one.<br> I invited her in, loudly locking the door behind her, just for effect. Guiding her to the middle of the room, I told her that she was not to move. Her dress, though sheer, was long, falling to mid-calf. It did little to hide the white panties and plain bra, both completely transparent. She'd chosen plain ones to offset the femininity of the garter and stocking set: all straps and lace and suggestion. Buttons ran down the entire front of her dress. I began at the top.<br> &quot;Don't move, now,&quot; I said as I popped the first button. &quot;Only your mouth. Tell me about how to give the best blowjob you know how to give.&quot; Second button.<br> &quot;There is the tray that has the flavor pot and brush and three shades of red lipstick. (Third button, and now I could make out the curve of the side of her breasts.) You start by painting the (Fourth button) erection with the flavoring and then suck (Fifth button) the flavor off. The scrotum is an important part of this. (Sixth button and I could smell her again, smell her desire.) Then, you put on the lightest shade of red lipstick, and start to suck. When the testicles draw (Seventh button, and the dress parted enough so that her breasts weren't covered at all. Her nipples pressed hard against the material of the cup of her bra..) up, then it's time to switch to the next deeper shade of red. This is the important time. It's hard to judge (Eighth button, almost down to the waist of her panties.) exactly when the orgasm is ready, but this is the moment to switch to the darkest shade of red. I try to guess by his breathing. (I slipped the dress off of her shoulders and it gauzily fell down her body. Without stumbling in her explanation, she stepped out of it. I threw it across the chair, and slowly walked around her while she spoke.) Never letting go, I switch lipstick and get it back into my mouth as soon as I can. It's best to give one long stroke, deep into your mouth, to get back into the groove. Faster and faster, until it begins to jump on the top of your tongue. That's the signal to start sucking as hard as you can. Pump your head up and down, sucking like mad, until he stops cumming. Leave him in your mouth as long as he wants afterwards, and don't forget to swallow all that he gives you.&quot;<br> I stood behind her as she finished her explanation, watching the smooth curves of her rear, accentuated by the curves of cloth that seemed to flow together before ducking between her legs. I moved in close, almost, but not quite, touching, breath blowing softly on her skin.<br> &quot;I've been staring at you from behind,&quot; I whispered into her neck. I knew she felt each puff of breath by the way she trembled. &quot;Could you feel me watching you? Feel my eyes touching you? I love watching you, getting harder and harder at every glance, itching to rub your body all over, hold you, squeeze you, pinch you until you fall open between your legs for me, so I might enter there and truly and completely have you. You want that don't you? You want me to have you. Tell me. Tell me you want me.&quot;<br> &quot;I want you. I want you to rub me, to touch me, to widen me and force yourself into me. I want you to have me completely, anyway you want me, every way you want. Ask me anything, and I'll do it. Anything.&quot;<br> &quot;Then clean up while I shower. It shouldn't be too much since your great job yesterday. Really just the dishes and the bed. My laundry bag is hung on the back of the closet door. While you're in there, won't you get my robe too. Thanks.&quot; It was fun to watch her face change as my commands switched back and forth between the two realms. She loved the one and was irritated and disappointed by the other. Back and forth, back and forth, in and out. &quot;If you finish before I do, then wait for me in the living room. Now before you go, undress me for the shower.&quot;<br> I loved having this woman, half-undressed herself and trying to provoke me, kneel at my feet to untie my shoes. She rubbed my feet as she shed them of the socks. As each foot emerged from its cocoon, she raised it to her lips and kissed. Then she raised herself up on her knees until she stared into my belt buckle. Slowly opening it and then my trousers. My erection strained against my shorts, but she stood. I wondered vaguely if she wasn't somehow tumbling to my game. Slowly again, she unbuttoned my shirt, exploring my chest and ribs with her fingernails raked lightly across my flesh. The sensation sent a flash of urgency to my straining erection, which also jumped a she pressed into me to slide the shirt off my shoulders and down my arms. I'm not sure how I managed to resist her.<br> In the shower, I trembled with the force required to not touch myself. Each time my hand fell against the huge erection that sprouted in front of my belly, I had to resist the mad compulsion to get myself off. There was so much better to come, I kept repeating to myself. Be patient and ready for her.<br> Clean, dry and wrapped in my robe, I found her sitting in my chair in the living room. Indeed, it was the only obvious chair in the room, except for the formed plastic ones I saved for when my card group got together at my place for a little poker. She looked so unbelievably desirable, sitting there in my chair in her underwear, carefully chosen underwear, chosen to please me. I motioned her out of my chair.<br> &quot;This is my place. You can have one of those chairs stacked up over there. Set it directly in front of me. There. Now sit. Don't cross your legs. Spread them a little. There, perfect.&quot;<br> Because the chair was made for sitting up straight in, her breasts thrust out unhidden by her shoulders or a slouch. I loved the way the material clung to and encased the flesh, shaping and molding it, smooth, curved and complete. Her nipples could be clearly seen through the fabric's sheen.<br> &quot;You are doing quite well in your probationary period. But this evening, we don't have a video like we did last night. So, before we get the tray, I want you to be the entertainment. Tell me a story. Tell me a story about a woman who is captured by a man, his slave, his willing sex slave. Tell me all the things he does to her. Now, sit up and tell me all about it.&quot;<br> She blushed furiously, thought for a moment and then spoke. &quot;It's complicated, a woman's relationship with a man, with a man who controls her, a man who controls her because she has given her all to him. Each command, each act is both a humiliation and a reward. She can earn his love, his devotion and care by completely surrendering herself to him. Please a man in bed, and you are his forever.&quot;<br> She smiled at me as she said this, and I made a note to remember what she thought about power over me. I'd have to do something about that, but later. For now, it was enough to watch her.<br> &quot;So, this is a story of a woman. I'll call her Esclava, just as you call me. She belonged to a man named Maestro, just as you are named. She needed to be with him and needed him to be with her. Hence, her entire submission to his whim. He had had her in all the ways that a man can have a woman and she loved him more for each of the ways she could service him.<br> One night, he took her out to a party at a house she's never been to. It seemed a typical party, small groups of people hovering around, soft music, furniture pushed up against the walls. A small table loaded with food and drinks. It was late, but not too late when they arrived. Everyone was nicely drunk, without being too far-gone. <br> He told her to get him a drink. She felt his eyes on her as she made her way across the room to the drinks table. Two white wines, one in either hand. He'd sat in a hard-backed chair against the wall. There was no chair near him, so she handed him his wine and sat at his feet. They sipped and looked around the room for a while. He asked her if she knew anyone there and she told him that the room was full of complete strangers. He said that perhaps that was good, since no one would know who she was when she did what he was going to tell her to do.&quot;<br> I could not take my eyes from her breasts as she told this story. Their swaying, their smooth curves, the firm roundness holding my eyes as she spoke.<br> &quot;He told her that he needed money and he had brought her here to make some. He told her to move around the room, into each and every conversation. She was to interrupt, explain that she was his sex slave, and tell them that he was going to auction off her clothes shortly. Anyone could bid on any item she was wearing, and if they had the highest bid, they could go home with that particular item. She was also to clarify that shoes and stockings went as a set, one item. She was to politely thank them and say that she hoped they'd stay. Then move on to the next conversation.<br> The first group was the hardest. She hovered and wavered on the outskirts of a small conversation. While she hesitated, she caught the glance of anger from him. Forcing down her pride, she let herself go entirely, These weren't her actions, they were his. She could do anything, as long as he told her to. She was powerful and able. Her voice was almost too loud at first.<br> &quot;Excuse me,&quot; she said and they all looked at her. Too late now. Had to go on. &quot;I have an announcement I'd like to make. I am a sex slave. My master has instructed me to tell you that he wants to have an auction in a few moments. He is going to sell the clothes I'm wearing. Shoes and stockings are a single item and will be sold as such. Highest bidder gets to take whatever piece home. Thanks you for listening and I hope you'll stay.&quot;<br> It was almost as if she no longer existed as she moved around the room. She felt in a place other than in the body that moved from group to group, with the message, he public admission of her darkest desire. Totally exposing herself to strangers because he'd told her to. Impossible but real.<br> But she had no idea what total exposure was until the auction began.&quot;<br> She squirmed in her seat as she said these words. Her breasts shifted in their close nests of cloth and her legs parted enough for me to see where the darkness of her pubic hair gathered in her lap. I told her to sit up and she did.<br> &quot; He had her climb up onto a low coffee table, so that she was easily seen by everyone without being beyond reach. He joined her there as she shouted out that the auction was about to begin, if they would all gather round. A crown formed all the way around the table. <br> The first thing he sold was her dress, and he invited the man who bought it up onto the table to remove it. His surreptitious touches excited her more than she'd have thought possible. Her nipples swirled into points, and wrinkled the satin of her slip. Next her stockings went to man who made no pretense of not touching her as he rolled them down her legs. His knuckles had brushed against the curve of her vulva, sending shivers up through her buttocks. She wondered if anyone could see her panties yet. No one in the audience knew that her bra was built into the slip, so she'd be naked before them soon.&quot;<br> Esclava was breathing harder now, breathily whispering her story. I asked her if she was excited by the story or the telling of it. She replied that obeying me excited her. She continued quickly before I could think of more questions.<br> &quot;Then a woman paid for her slip. She was stunned. She's never been touched by a woman before. Not in this way. The woman climbed up on the table and pressed into her from behind. Reaching under her arms, hands roamed up and down the front of her slip. The audience purred with delight. Slowly the hands once rubbed over her breasts before sliding down to the hem. A little lift and most of her panties could be clearly seen by all. She lifted her arms to assist with her own unveiling. Up over her stomach, bunching slightly just below her breasts, and then over her head. Her breasts swung free, eliciting another purr of appreciation.<br> Now she was mostly naked and resisting the desire to curl up into a small ball to flee the probing eyes. The only one not fully dressed in the room, men and women staring at her nakedness. For him. He'd earned over $100 selling her clothes, and sold her panties for another $100.<br> The man who came to get them made free with her body, in front of all these people. He rubbed her breasts and cupped his hand between her legs. She responded to his touch, unable to resist. So charged with sexual energy, she rocked her pelvis on his palm while his other hand fled here and there across her body. He pinched her nipples, causing her to gasp. The audience murmured. She looked and saw all of their eyes on her, on the man as his hands made free with her body. As she exploded with desire and sexuality. She came and came and came. Three times in front of this crowd. The last one was so powerful that her lasciviousness was boundless. She added her hands to the one already at her crotch, pressing him into her as she rocked and began to moan.<br> Once she was through, her panties slid off almost as an anticlimax. Maestro made her stand with her arms over her head and her legs spread so that anyone who wanted to could stare directly into her sex, where she had just orgasmed in front of a crowd of people. Finally, he let her step down, but the didn't leave immediately as she wanted to. He made her stand near him, entirely naked, so that they all could look.&quot;<br> I parted the edges of my robe and a huge erection bobbed out. &quot;Looks like I rather liked your story. Another point in your favor. You really do please me.&quot; Esclava's face burst into a grin as I said this, a hopelessly goofy grin, huge. &quot;So much so that I think when you come tomorrow, you must be ready to cook dinner for me. Something not too heavy, with wine. I knew you'd like that. Now, go get the tray.&quot;</p> <p></p> <b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><a href="mailto:Sonofleigh@aol.com">Sonofleigh@aol.com</a> </font></b><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> </font></b><!-- #EndEditable --><br>
