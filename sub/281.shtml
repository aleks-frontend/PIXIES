Indeed, it flattered her when men showed interest in her. So it wasn't too surprising that after a little persuading from her colleague, Jonathan, Charlotte invited him to visit for dinner. Jonathan was quite a shy young man, who however thought he saw a kindred spirit in Charlotte who worked opposite him in the Approvals section of the department. <br> Jonathan was quite prepared to see Emma naked when he arrived. And there, just as Charlotte had warned, was Emma seated in front of a television watching a video showing men making love to other men. Not his kind of film, but Jonathan had been warned of the nature of the research Emma was undertaking so he was less surprised than he might otherwise have been. Another girl was also watching television who Charlotte introduced as Harriett. Charlotte was herself rather surprised to find Harriett was also not wearing any clothes except for what was perhaps the bottom of a swimming costume. However, Charlotte made no comment as she usually wore less than that, but she nonetheless felt an acute pang of jealousy. <br> Emma and Harriett were very civil to Jonathan and asked him questions about his work and what Charlotte was like to work with, while the hostess in the meantime was busy in the kitchen preparing a meal for the four of them. Jonathan occasionally popped into the kitchen to pass a few words with her. &quot;Your friends seem very affectionate towards you,&quot; he commented. <br> &quot;Affectionate?&quot; wondered Charlotte as she put the potatoes into the oven. <br> &quot;Well fond of you,&quot; he laughed. &quot;Actually,&quot; he commented, &quot;it is a bit disconcerting your friends not wearing clothes. I don't know where to look.&quot; <br> &quot;Just be discreet,&quot; advised Charlotte, wondering how disconcerted Jonathan would be in a normally naturist household. <br> The meal was a success. Charlotte was delighted by the praise her cooking got from Emma and Harriet. &quot;You ought to have friends round more often,&quot; smiled Emma holding Charlotte's hand tightly in hers. Charlotte felt a sudden flush of affection for Emma, but with Jonathan and Harriett there she couldn't kiss her as she wanted to, but she reciprocated Emma's squeeze and smiled back affectionately. <br> &quot;Don't worry about the washing up,&quot; volunteered Harriett when the last of the bottle of wine was drunk and the cheese board was bare. Charlotte smiled, and Jonathan regarded her longingly. Experience told Charlotte what the look meant, and she had no intention of disappointing him. Indeed, while Emma and Harriett settled in the kitchen to wash and dry up, Charlotte took Jonathan to her room to consummate the evening. <br> Knowing how shy Jonathan was, and in any case itching from the unaccustomed feel of clothes in the flat (which was always kept warm for Emma's benefit), Charlotte took the incentive in taking off her clothes. It took little more persuasion for Jonathan to undress and for her to take his throbbing member into her palm to hasten the process. His penis trembled excitedly in her hand, but she didn't want it spurting wasted all over the carpet. She took her hand away from there, and massaged and pecked Jonathan about the face, chest and upper thighs. It took all Charlotte's skill to delay the time when the two fell onto the bed and for Jonathan to hump away on top of her. <br> Charlotte always found sex with men slightly amusing ? she could never find it disgusting as she was sure lesbians should do. And she also found it very exciting. As Emma had often commented, when Charlotte got very excited she got carried away and would soon be screaming with ecstasy. Perhaps it was the wine, perhaps it was Jonathan or perhaps it was the warm feeling of affection that she'd got from Emma, but she felt exceptionally passionate today. As she screamed out while Jonathan hammered away, his tongue in her ear and Charlotte's legs wrapped around his waist, she knew that it might disturb the neighbours let alone be audible to Emma and Harriett, but she didn't care. <br> After an hour or so, Charlotte was quite exhausted, so she wandered naked out of her bedroom to the kitchen to get some beers out of the refrigerator. Both of them were now very hot and sticky ? rivulets of perspiration running down their faces and shining on their bellies. Emma was already in the kitchen making some sandwiches for the following day. Charlotte was a little embarrassed to encounter Emma with the smell of sex emanating so strongly from her. The hairs of her vagina were a soggy mess and she felt a drip of semen flow slowly out from her vagina and down the inside of her thigh. Unthinkingly, she glanced down at it and when she looked up she could see that Emma's eyes had also been drawn there. <br> &quot;I can see you and your friend are having a very pleasant time,&quot; remarked Emma kindly. &quot;He is staying the night isn't he?&quot; <br> &quot;Well, if he wants to,&quot; Charlotte replied. Emma smiled and leant over slightly to kiss Emma on the face. Charlotte responded by grabbing Emma around the shoulders and showering kisses on her face and squeezing her against her sweaty front. Emma gently pushed Charlotte off. <br> &quot;Don't be silly, Charlotte,&quot; she admonished. <br> Charlotte felt even more aroused after her encounter with Emma and in the ensuing lovemaking with Jonathan it was Emma who was foremost in Charlotte's thoughts as Jonathan thrust away. Charlotte forced Jonathan to enter her from other positions ? including from behind (but not, despite Jonathan's entreaties, into the anus). Charlotte's screams and cries echoed into the night and soon there was no more to do than lie back and recover. Charlotte's crotch ached from the battering it had taken but it was a pleasant ache that reminded her of all her recent pleasure. She studied Jonathan's shrivelled penis which was still moist and shiny if no longer so very appealing. Charlotte tenderly kissed it and stroked Jonathan's testicles, but carefully so as not to wake him up. He was a nice boy, Charlotte felt, but her first love was always Emma. Just the thought of her hug with Emma filled Charlotte with enormous desire. <br> This aching passion for Emma compelled Charlotte to push open the door leading to Emma's room. She often did this to relish Emma sleeping peacefully in her bed. Sometimes, Charlotte would sit for hours by Emma as she slept just to feel the pleasure of her closeness and the sound of her breath. She loved the cherubic expression on Emma's face as she breathed. She loved the opportunity to study what she could see of Emma's naked body, without being accused of voyeurism. The wonderful breasts, that slender waist, the hair that fanned out over the sheets and tangled in her nipple. <br> Emma wasn't in bed, nor did it look like the sheets were disturbed. A little alarmed, Charlotte wandered through Emma's bedroom and then around the living room and kitchen. No sign of her there. But she could hear a little giggle. Charlotte started. Nothing! And then again, just a little louder followed by a tiny shriek. It was coming from Harriett's bedroom. <br> Harriett often had lovers staying the night, so this wasn't unusual ? but with Emma not in her bed, Charlotte feared the worst as she softly pushed open Harriett's bedroom door. The walls of Harriett's room were covered with posters of sporting heroes and heroines, and it was these that Charlotte first saw as her eyes became accustomed to the light shining in from the street lamp through the window. Then, as she feared, she saw Emma and Harriett together in bed kissing and cuddling each other. No! Charlotte corrected herself. It was Harriett spreadeagled, arse towards the door with Emma underneath busily tonguing her vagina. Charlotte gasped. <br> Emma looked up, startled. &quot;Oh, it's you!&quot; she said, sounding not too pleased. &quot;What do you want?&quot; <br> &quot;I ... I ... just wondered why you weren't in your bed.&quot; <br> &quot;Who could possibly sleep with you and Jonathan making so much noise in the room next door?&quot;<br> &quot;But ... but...&quot; Charlotte gasped, the few remaining tatters of her dream that Emma was in truth reserved for her flying and scattering as Harriett and Emma readjusted themselves to face her, both naked, both sweaty, both with the hair on the head and below bedraggled and ragged, neither looking too amused. <br> &quot;Charlotte,&quot; said Harriett reasonably. &quot;What Emma and I do is not your business ? and besides you're clearly having quite a fun time with your boyfriend.&quot; <br> &quot;It's not the ... not the same,&quot; Charlotte stuttered on the edge of tears. <br> &quot;It is,&quot; Harriett insisted. <br> &quot;No, it isn't,&quot; contradicted Emma. &quot;You're having sex with a boy. I'm merely being affectionate with a friend. You have nothing to be jealous about. So go to bed.&quot; <br> Charlotte sighed. She wouldn't be able to resolve this by crying. She smiled sadly and defeated as she eased Harriett's door shut. <br> &quot;Good night,&quot; called one of Harriett or Emma as she left. <br> &quot;Good night,&quot; mumbled Charlotte as she returned to her bed which, with Jonathan in it, seemed too crowded and even uninviting now. </p> <b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> </font></b><!-- #EndEditable --></td>
