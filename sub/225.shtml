                          <td colspan="2" width="100%"> <!-- #BeginEditable "story" --> <p> It was Friday night. My husband Conrad and Janet's husband Grant were in the living room watching the basketball game on TV. It was a close game and they were taunting each other as to which was going to win the bet. They were going on a golf trip on Saturday and they had bet over the game on TV. The loser had to pay for the entire trip. I was honestly hoping Conrad would win. Given the total cost for the trip, it was a large bet.<br> Janet and I were in the kitchen talking, all sorts of girl talk. We were also listening to the Guys watching the game. I wanted to go shopping Saturday, but if Conrad lost I would have to put that off a while. Janet suggested we go shopping, but I told her my predicament. She figured she was much in the same shape. We got interested enough to turn on TV in the kitchen so we could watch the game. Janet said, maybe we should bet on the game too.<br> &quot;Bet what?&quot; I replied.<br> She said, &quot;Well since whichever one of us who's husband loses cannot <br> afford to go shopping, and the other one can, the loser between you and me has to carry all the packages for the winner.&quot;<br> I said, &quot;You would do that? You would go and buy all sorts of stuff and make me carry it while I can't buy anything.&quot;<br> &quot;Of course. And you'd do the same to me and like it, wouldn'tyou?&quot;<br> &quot;Well, yea. I think I'd enjoy that.&quot;<br> She said, &quot;OK, here's the bet. Who ever loses has to be slave for the <br> day to the winner.&quot;<br> &quot;Slave?&quot;<br> &quot;Complete and total slave. The loser has to do anything the winner <br> wants, no restrictions whatsoever.&quot;<br> Janet is a very nice looking woman, very well dressed, very elegant. I have to admit the idea of her carrying my packages,opening doors for me, being at my every whim, kissing my ass all day was very inviting. I agreed to make the bet with her.<br> We watched the rest of the game as intently as our husbands did. It was very close, down to the last second. My team was ahead, and it looked like I was going to win. Janet's team threw up a prayer from half-court and it went in. I was stunned. At the last possible moment Janet had won the bet.<br> Janet and Grant were leaving. Conrad was supposed to pick Grant up at six o'clock in the morning. Janet said to me, &quot;Rideover to my house with Conrad.&quot;<br> &quot;At six o'clock?&quot;<br> &quot;Yes, at six o'clock. You have a long day ahead of you.&quot;<br> I was relieved that she didn't tell the guys about our bet. This was <br> going to be bad enough as it was. I dressed reasonably nice, pants, blouse, jacket, and arrived with Conrad. Conrad and Grant loaded up and left. Janet hadn't even gotten out of bed yet. She yelled for me to come to the bedroom, then she told me to go in the kitchen and make breakfastfor her. She wanted the whole big layout, eggs, bacon, biscuits. I fixed the breakfast while Janet showered. She finally came inwearing only a silk robe and ate. I asked her what she had planned for the day. She said, &quot;I haven't the foggiest idea. I'm making this up as I go. However, whatever I do you will be there to make sure I enjoy it.&quot;<br> She went to the living room and sat in a recliner. She looked at me and said, &quot;You're dressed too nice to be a slave, too elegant. Let's pick you out something to wear more suitable for the role you have to play today.&quot;<br> She led me to the bedroom and picked some things out of the closet, up high on the back of a shelf that I know had nothing she had worn in a long time. It was a short leather skirt and a knit top. I said, &quot;This is going to make me look cheap.&quot;<br> &quot;You catch on quick,&quot; she replied. &quot;That's exactly what it'ssupposed to make you look like. You're supposed to be my slave, I want you to live the part. I want you to look cheap, and I want you to feel cheap. Now take off that nice outfit of yours and put this on. Now!&quot;<br> I said, &quot;OK,&quot; and I took off my jacket and blouse and finally my pants.<br> I started to put on the knit top she had gotten out for me when she <br> said, &quot;Stop.&quot; Take off your bra first.<br> &quot;I can't go out in public like that&quot;, I said. &quot;I might shine through.&quot; &quot;Shine through&quot; was a code phrase for when your nipples would show through.<br> &quot;You won't shine through unless you get worked up, but then walking around in public dressed like a cheap whore is just the sort of thing that works you up isn't it? Take off the bra.&quot; I took off my bra and just stood there in my panties looking at her, waiting for her st say something, hoping she would change her mind. She didn't. &quot;Take your panties off two,&quot; she said.<br> &quot;What? You want me to go out in public wearing that skirt and no underwear?&quot;<br> &quot;Yes. You are my slave today, and that's exactly what I want.&quot;<br> &quot;Somebody's going to see everything I've got.&quot;<br> &quot;Maybe. Maybe not. You'll just have to be very careful how you sit <br> won't you.&quot;<br> I waited, looked at her in silence for several moments. It was obvious that she was serious. I pulled my panties past my knees and to my ankles. I started to reach for the top again when she said, &quot;No. Not yet. Help me get dressed first.&quot; She turned her back to me and started taking the robe off her shoulders. &quot;Hang this up,&quot; she said. She sat on the edge of the bed and said, &quot;Top drawer on the left. Let's go with dark blue today, matching bra and panties.&quot; I got what she asked for out of the drawer. I handed them to her. She started putting the bra on and said, &quot;Hook this for me.&quot; I hooked her bra. She looked at the panties andthen smiled and said, &quot;Put these back. I don't think I'll wear panties either. Of course, I'll pick out a longer skirt than yours. Go to the drawer on the to right and get out a pair of dark blue stockings, elastic top.&quot; I found them. Janet laid back on the bed and said, &quot;Put them on me.&quot;<br> I was beginning to wonder if Janet was having thoughts about me sexually or if she was just enjoying embarrassing me and putting me in the most awkward positions possible. I had never done it with a woman. I had thought about it, but never seriously. After my relationship with Conrad became permanent, I never thought about it anymore. Janet was causing me to think about it again. I think she knew it.<br> Janet picked out a beautiful dark blue dress, knee length,that went perfect with the stockings. I put on my cheap outfit. I looked like a street walker and she looked like a million bucks.<br> We went to the garage and I started to get in her car. She said, &quot;Let's take Grant's car.&quot; Grant's car was a corvette convertible, with very high door sills. Getting in or out would give the whole world a full view. I think that's why she wanted to drive it.<br> I followed her around and carried things, at the mall, at the shoe store, in the downtown shopping district. We ended up in a very expensive store downtown. Janet picked out five dresses and told me to carry them. She asked the lady working there if she could try them on. We went back to the dressing room. It was barely big enough for the two of us and the five dresses. Janet took off her dress and had me help her into one of the others. Janet, one at a time tried on each dress. After the last one, she took it back off and just stood there in her bra and stockings. She said, &quot;I think this would look better on you. Try it on.&quot;<br> &quot;I can't afford it,&quot; I said.<br> &quot;I didn't ask you that. I told you to try it on,&quot; she said. I took off <br> the top and skirt I was wearing. Janet held up thedress and said, &quot;Turn around and give me your arms.&quot; I was expecting to feel the dress slid up my arms. Instead I felt something cold. I heard clicking. Before I realized what happened she had handcuffed me. She hung the dress back up. I turned to face her. She looked at me and said, &quot;I told you this was going tobe the most enjoyable shopping trip of my life. Get on your knees.&quot;<br> We were in the changing room of a clothing store. It didn't even have a full door. You could stand on your tip toes and look over the door. There was a foot gap between the bottom of the door and the floor. She had to be kidding. This was just another stunt to embarrass me. I said, &quot;Janet, No. You've got to be kidding.&quot;<br> She pushed me against the wall and started massaging my crotch. She said, &quot;You look me in the eye and tell me you don't want this and it won't happen.&quot; My body was already responding to her touch. I couldn't look at her. She pushed me to my knees and put one of her legs up on the bench beside me. She held my face against the inside of her leg just where the stocking ended. She said, &quot;You know what to do slut. You've been wanting this for along time haven't you?&quot; I couldn't answer. I started licking her thigh, working my way up. Finally, I had my face buried in her cunt licking away. She started to breathe different. He hips were moving in a slow rhythm against my mouth.<br> There was a knock at the door. Janet, out of breath, said, &quot;Yes.&quot; As a complete surprise to both of us, the door opened. The sales lady caught a full view of my face in Janet's crotch. She gasped in shock. Janet quickly said, &quot;You get paid on commission right?&quot; The lady, still stunned, nodded. Janet said, &quot;I'll take all five. We'll be out in a minute.&quot;<br> The lady closed the door back. Janet looked at me and said, &quot;Finish me.&quot; I went back to work on her. It didn't take long until she came.<br> We both got dressed and hurried out. I wanted to rush to the car but Janet made me stand there at the cash register while the same lady that had walked in on us checked us out. It was the most embarrassing moment of my life. Janet had to rub it in as much as possible.</p> <b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> </font></b><!-- #EndEditable --></td>
