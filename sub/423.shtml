        <p>pt. 2: Karen<br>
          The night I saw my wife, Crystal, and my manager, Dave, passionately 
          fucking in my bed was the night my life changed forever. I would be 
          lying if I didn t admit that I had been tempted many times in the past 
          to cheat on Crystal, but I never went past fantasizing about doing it.<br>
          Now it was all I thought about. Well, actually that s not exactly true. 
          The thing I thought about the most during the two weeks following the 
          night was Crystal and Dave. The moans of my wife climaxing with another 
          man echoed in my head. The sight of her body riding his manhood, both 
          of the completely caught up in the passion flashed across the video 
          of my mind on an almost continuous loop. <br>
          I had breakfast with Dave the next morning. And as he sat across from 
          me asking me all kinds of questions about my training, I couldn t help 
          but wonder how often he was fucking my beautiful wife. When did it start? 
          Did he feel any guilt at all sitting there across from me, acting like 
          he hadn t been eating her pussy just twelve hours earlier?<br>
          I went about my daily work after that night as if nothing had changed. 
          But everything had changed. I knew I would act upon any and every temptation 
          that availed itself to me. I figured I had nothing to lose. Even if 
          I was caught sleeping with another woman, what could my wife say? After 
          all, I knew about her activities, and while I planned on telling her 
          I knew at some point, why not enjoy the secret for awhile?<br>
          It didn t take long for an opportunity to come my way. I guess since 
          I was watching for any sign of an invitation from my female clients, 
          it was easy to spot when it happened. It would be like me telling you 
          to watch for Volkswagen Beetles all day today. You would probably be 
          amazed at how many you saw, simply because you were looking for them.<br>
          Well, I saw my first invitation to adventure exactly two weeks to the 
          day I watched Crystal and Dave in my bed. And it was a wonderful invitation.<br>
          Her name was Karen, and she had been a client of mine since I had begun 
          working for my agency about a year ago. At the time I had met with her 
          and her husband Jack at their home. We put together a full financial 
          plan. I remember being surprised to learn that they had never taken 
          out a life insurance policy. They were well off financially, had a beautiful 
          home with all the luxuries, and yet had never thought of what would 
          happen if one of them died. <br>
          Jack was the sole bread winner. He had a very good job and took wonderful 
          care of Karen and their four year old son, Michael. I strongly encouraged 
          him to get enough life insurance to cover all of their debts, Michael 
          s education, and enough income to allow Karen to live comfortably for 
          the rest of her life. He finally agreed and we filled out the paper 
          work.<br>
          I was shocked when two months later, I received a phone call from Karen 
          telling me that Jack had been killed in an car accident. She was devastated, 
          and I did all I could for her. <br>
          I remember going out of my way to help her through her tragedy. I don 
          t know why I did it, I don t usually do, but I went to the funeral to 
          support her and Michael. I even checked in on them from time to time, 
          and took Michael out to a couple of sports games. <br>
          The night I met with Karen, we were going to go over the plan I had 
          put in place for them to make the necessary changes now that she was 
          alone. The insurance policy had left her with a substantial amount of 
          money and no debt, and I wanted to make sure that it would be invested 
          wisely so that she would never have to worry about money the rest of 
          her life.<br>
          I rang the doorbell and watched through the glass panel as she approached 
          the door. I was struck again at how beautiful she was. Her hair was 
          dark black, as dark as midnight. It fell down past her shoulders and 
          curled up slightly just above her breasts. Her eyes were a deep green, 
          made that way by the colored contacts she wore. She was exactly five 
          foot eight inches, and weighed one hundred and twelve pounds. I knew 
          that information because we had taken it down as a part of her insurance 
          policy. She was a very healthy woman, and while she didn t work out 
          on a regular basis, she definitely had a fit body.<br>
          She opened the door and smiled at me. Hi Pete. She said, giving me a 
          quick hug and allowing me into her home.<br>
          The hug was something that had started after the first time I had taken 
          Michael to a game. When I arrived back at the house with him, she gave 
          me a hug as her way of saying thanks. From that time on, we hugged every 
          time we saw each other. I never thought anything of it until now. <br>
          How s everything? I asked, kicking off my shoes and following her into 
          the kitchen. <br>
          Oh, fine, I guess. Michael s doing really good. He s<br>
          really excited about junior kindergarten, although I m<br>
          not. I guess I m a little nervous about seeing him go<br>
          off to school already. He s too young. <br>
          I smiled at her, taping her hand, He s going to grow<br>
          up fast, you know. Before you realize it, he ll be<br>
          hitting on all the girls in school. <br>
          We continued with the small talk for awhile as I set up my laptop and 
          got ready to review her financial plan.<br>
          Just as we were ready to get going, I looked over at<br>
          her and realized she looked lonely. I pushed the<br>
          computer to the side and touched her shoulder. Karen,<br>
          how are YOU doing? <br>
          She looked back at me as if trying to decide what to say. I waited, 
          not wanting to rush her, but wanting to make sure she was okay. I realized 
          at that moment that I liked her. She was a nice woman who had a bad 
          thing happen. I cared. And I think she knew it.<br>
          She tried to start a few times, but then paused again. Finally she just 
          blurted out, Oh, this is going to sound so crazy, Pete. I guess I m 
          just lonely. But not in the way you think. You see, I loved Jack, and 
          am not looking to replace him just yet. After all, I doubt I ll ever 
          find anyone as good as him. He was the best husband in the world. But 
          I m only thirty four years old. This sounds stupid, but I guess I m 
          hitting my peak or something, but I m just lonely for a man s touch.<br>
          Jack and I were very passionate in bed together. We<br>
          made love almost every night of the week. I mean, it<br>
          was a great part of our marriage. And I wasn t doing<br>
          it just to please him, I enjoy sex a lot. I mean a lot<br>
          I can t believe I m saying all this but I miss<br>
          having sex. Every time I think about going out on a<br>
          date with someone, I feel so guilty. Besides, I don t<br>
          want to date anyone. I m not looking for a<br>
          relationship with someone, I m just looking for<br>
          someone who can satisfy me. <br>
          She looked down. Her eyes were slightly moist and she was shaking a 
          little. I could tell she was embarrassed. She had spoken so quickly, 
          as if she was afraid that if she didn t say it now, she never would.</p>
        <p>I reached over to her and lifted her chin until her gaze met mine. 
          My hand remained gently on her face, her skin so soft to my touch. I 
          smiled slightly, keeping eye contact as I leaned forward in my seat. 
          <br>
          Her breathing became quicker as our faces came closer together. Our 
          eyes were locked until at last our lips touched. Our first kiss was 
          soft and gentle, our mouths dry from nervousness. We kissed again. Her 
          eyes closed and her mouth opened, and soon our tongues met. Her mouth 
          was so warm, her kisses so tentative. We stood up, our kisses now filled 
          with passion. Our tongues were darting out of each other s mouth. My 
          breathing now matched Karen s. We embraced, pulling our bodies tight 
          together as our relationship forever changed.<br>
          I looked at her beautiful face, and saw the first tear fall down her 
          cheek. I reached over and wiped it away, pausing from our kissing. Are 
          you sure you want to do this? I asked, wanting to make sure that she 
          was still comfortable.<br>
          Yes. She replied, bringing her lips back to mine.<br>
          We kissed again, my hands moving under her shirt and across her back. 
          Her skin was so soft. Her body felt so amazing pressed against mine.<br>
          Suddenly she stopped and pulled away. Her eyes smiled at me as she took 
          a hold of my hand and began to lead me down the hallway. My laptop and 
          paperwork was left incomplete on the table. I followed her up the stairs, 
          past the closed door of Michael, sound asleep, and into Karen s bedroom.<br>
          She paused at the bottom of the bed and turned back to me. We embraced 
          again, our lips connecting and our mouths opening to each other again. 
          Our bodies pushed against each other, my cock pushing against my suit 
          pants and against her belly. <br>
          Once again I reached under her top. I lifted it up and over her shoulders. 
          Our kissing stopping just long enough to allow the shirt to pass over 
          her head. She had no bra on, and her beautiful breasts pressed against 
          my chest. <br>
          Her hands reached for my tie, pulling it off quickly. As she began to 
          unbutton my shirt, I slid my hands between us and up to her tits. Her 
          nipples were fully erect, and my fingers quickly went to work on them. 
          I squeezed them and pulled at them, gently at first, but with a little 
          more force with each touch. <br>
          Finally my shirt was off, and Karen brought her lips down to my chest. 
          She began to kiss my nipples, pushing aside my chest hair to get a clean 
          feel of them. Her mouth bit down on my right nipple, pulling at it until 
          it was tight. She then put her mouth over the other one. My hands continued 
          on her breasts, feeling them, enjoying them, wanting them.<br>
          She dropped to her knees and kissed my manhood through my pants. Her 
          mouth continued to push against it as she began to undo my belt and 
          zip down my jeans. As they dropped to the floor, she looked at my boxers, 
          smiling at the fullness of my cock hiding behind the thin layer of material.<br>
          Without hesitation, she pulled them away, and I sprang loose. I looked 
          down and watched as she opened her mouth and wrapped her lips around 
          the head of my hard penis. I grunted as I felt the first warm touch 
          of her tongue across the sensitive head of my cock. It felt amazing. 
          <br>
          Up until that point, I just assumed that a blow job was a blow job. 
          For the past ten years, the only mouth that had taken in my cock was 
          Crystal s. Sure I had enjoyed oral sex before Crystal, but I had forgotten 
          how different each female sucks cock. To suddenly have another woman 
          s tongue run up and down my manhood after ten years of the same mouth, 
          was unbelievable. In fact, I find it difficult to describe it adequately. 
          <br>
          She began sucking hard, taking as much of my eight inches into her mouth 
          as she could. Her hands began to run my balls as she worked on my cock. 
          <br>
          I could feel myself already coming close to climax, and wanted to hold 
          off as long as possible, so I reached down and took a hold of her shoulders. 
          I pulled her back up to her feet knowing that a few more seconds in 
          her mouth and I would cum. <br>
          She clearly didn t want to stop and took a few more sucks before rising 
          to her feet. As our mouths met again, I could feel the warmth of her 
          tongue that had just been sliding up and down my shaft.<br>
          My hands went back to her breasts, and I bent over to take on into my 
          mouth. My hand squeezed and massaged it as my tongue flicked at her 
          erect nipple. Her chest rose and fell with every breath, and I knew 
          that she was very horny. Her nipples were so different that Crystal 
          s. Where Crystal had full, big nipples, Karen s were tiny points coming 
          out from her breasts. My teeth pulled at them, biting down just as she 
          had down to me.<br>
          I dropped to my knees and begin to kiss her belly. She was in wonderful 
          shape, and her skin was soft and delicious. I pulled off her pants, 
          and was a little surprised to see that she had no panties on. She had 
          obviously planned on something happening tonight. <br>
          She had trimmed up her hairs, allowing for just a slight triangle of 
          pubic hairs to remain, pointing the way to her sweet pussy. My hands 
          felt their way around her tight ass as my kisses moved lower. I could 
          smell her juices as my mouth moved close to her mound, and I couldn 
          t wait to enjoy her taste.<br>
          Gently I pushed her back until she sat down on the bed. Her legs spread 
          apart and I began to kiss her inner thighs. I moved down one leg until 
          I reached her knee, and then went over to the other leg and worked my 
          way back up to her mound.<br>
          Her breathing was so heavy as she waited for my tongue to touch her. 
          I waited also, wanting to build the anticipation. My hot breath pushed 
          against her very moist lips, her pussy almost begging to be touched. 
          But I waited. Her hands went to my head, and she tried to push me into 
          her cunt, but I pulled back, breathing a deep breath of air over her 
          mound. My hands reached up and began to caress her stomach, moving down 
          to her hair. Her legs spread wider as she beckoned me to eat her. <br>
          Oh, Peter, please, I need to feel your touch so badly, please, let me 
          feel your tongue! She cried, pushing harder on the back of my head.<br>
          Instead, I moved my hands down between her legs. I begin to gently touch 
          her lips with my fingers, Playing with them, spreading them apart, watching 
          her juices cover my fingertips. I continued to breath into her as my 
          fingers began to touch her more. I would slide a thumb inside her and 
          then pull it out just as quickly. <br>
          Her breathing was so strong now, her body so clearly desperate for more. 
          <br>
          With my thumb and one finger I spread apart her lips, exposing a very 
          swollen clit. My mouth moved even closer and my hot breath ran across 
          it. I paused one more second, and then very softly, very gently, allowed 
          to tip of my tongue to run flick across Karen s clit.<br>
          She moaned loudly, her body arching quickly into the air. Another lick 
          of my tongue. Another moan. I allowed my licks to go longer, taking 
          in more of her pussy. She was so wet, her juices simply falling onto 
          my tongue. Her taste was amazing. <br>
          I have always loved oral sex, and I finally could hold back no longer. 
          I dove in, pushing my tongue as deep inside her as I could. I was quick 
          and furious now, licking and sucking and swallowing her juice like a 
          man in the desert desperate for water. <br>
          She moaned non-stop as my lips pressed down on her clit, sucking on 
          it like she had sucked on my cock. She was delicious, and I intended 
          to have as much of her as she could handle. My goatee was soaked now, 
          but I wanted more. Her hands were up over her head, reaching for anything 
          she could grab on to, but finding nothing but the sheets. My hands were 
          back up at her breasts, each one pulling at a nipple, tweaking them. 
          <br>
          Oh, you are amazing! My god! I can t believe what<br>
          you re doing to me! She cried between heavy breaths,<br>
          I don t want this to ever stop! I want you tongue in<br>
          me forever! <br>
          I pushed deeper, moving one hand back between her legs, which were now 
          spread as far apart as possible. I pushed two, and then three fingers 
          inside her as my lips remained closed around her clit. My fingers wiggled 
          inside her, reaching around until they rested on her secret spot. <br>
          She groaned louder as they rested inside her, pressing against her most 
          sensitive place. Pete! Fuck me! I m going to cum and I want you in me! 
          She yelled.<br>
          I lifted my head from her pussy and quickly slid up her body, my cock 
          sliding inside her without hesitation. She was still so wet that I was 
          deep inside her without any pressure. I covered her lips with my mouth, 
          hoping to quiet her down a little. I was afraid she d wake up her son, 
          she was so lost in our fucking.<br>
          She began to devour my mouth, licking my goatee, cleaning her juices 
          off my face. My cock slide in and out of her, pounding down with force. 
          This was a hard, fast fuck. <br>
          She moaned again, and bit down on my bottom lip as her climax began. 
          Her cunt lips tighten around my shaft and I could feel her body begin 
          to tense underneath me. I could handle no more and my cock began to 
          swell as I cum flowed up my shaft. I exploded inside her as she hit 
          her peak, both of us grunting as our bodies tightened together.<br>
          After we were done, we laid on the bed, our arms still wrapped together. 
          We kissed gently, neither of us saying a word for a long time.<br>
          Finally I spoke, Karen, you okay with this? <br>
          She looked at me and smiled, Oh yes, I sure am. Thank<br>
          you for doing this. It was incredible. <br>
          I think she could tell that I was still a little<br>
          worried, so she continued, Pete, I meant what I said<br>
          downstairs. I m definitely not looking for a<br>
          relationship. I know you are married and everything,<br>
          and I m not looking for more than what you just did. I<br>
          do hope you plan on doing this to me more often, but I<br>
          don t want anything more than this from you. <br>
          I smiled and kissed her again. She clearly knew what she wanted, and 
          I was more than happy to offer myself to her.<br>
          I think I could help you out on a regular basis.<br>
          After all, you are my client, and I did promise you<br>
          the best possible service available. <br>
          She smiled and we kissed again.</p>
