                          <td colspan="2" width="100%"> <!-- #BeginEditable "story" --> <p>My second year as a teacher was a very eventful one in oh so many ways. My boyfriend Paul, of three years took off saying he couldn't live HIS life in my classroom. He went on in detail to explain how I brought too much work home, and left no time for HIM!! To be honest I was glad when he left, but I didn't realise how lonely I'd become. Work filled my every working moment, perhaps Paul had a point after all.<br> On a cold November day it fell to me to take the girls to the swimming baths. They weren't my class,but were third year juniors.(ten year olds) All I had to do was supervise getting on and off the bus, and generally help Pauline the swimming teacher,when they got in the baths. The children were well behaved and all seemed to be going perfectly. All the kids were lined up at the water side, ready to start, when, having counted up, I realised there was one girl missing. I went into the the changing rooms in search of the missing swimmer, leaving the Pauline to begin the lesson alone. The changing room seemed empty, but as I pushed the toilet door open the missing pupil came into view. Jan Peters was sat astride the toilet, crying loudly. I didn't notice her costume at first. It lay on the floor beside her, leaving her naked, sobbing on the toilet. Jan told me that her new costume was too small, and she couldn't get it on. I offered to help her put it on, and with a smile accepted my help. <br> Only as she stood up did I notice her perfect young body. To this point in my life, I had had no inclinations toward ANY females, but young Jan was to change all that!<br> I picked up her costume, but found myself staring at her, particularly her forming breasts, and the tiny tufts of soft black pussy hair. She stepped forward, putting her feet into the costume and thrusting her hips and breasts toward me. Unable to resist, I took the tiny nipple into my mouth. Almost immediately Jan pulled me tight to her, rubbing my hair as she did so. Her tiny breast was swelling in my mouth, so I switched to the other one, sucking hungrily. Jan felt limp in my arms, but I felt her hand tracing the line of my bra at the back, pausing over the clips, and with great skill, undid it through my blouse and jumper. At that I jumped back but by then the small hands gently closed around my breasts as the nipples hardened instantly. The noise of the children in the pool suddenly filled my ears, I stood stuttering to Jan that she could get dressed and wait for the lesson to end. To my surprise she nodded, but only on the understanding that my bra remained unfastened. I agreed, unable to think of a reason to say no. After the lesson we returned to school, exchanging neither words or glances. Although I saw Jan every day at school, she kept her distance. Then out of the blue, she came up to me when I was on yard duty to tell me something in confidence. We arranged to meet at lunch time in my room. I wondered what the news could be..<br> Jan arrved on time and as she crossed the classroom floor she stepped out of her knickers. With a wicked grin she suggested I do the same. As I rose from my desk Jan pushed me back into my seat, and reached up my skirt roughly pulling at my tights and pants. She was not going to be able to remove them without help, but I was more than willing to help and eased my bottom off the the seat, as Jan roughly pulled my undies off. My underwear went straight to Jan's nose, and she then set to lick and kiss my sweaty pants. I was helpless as she hoisted up my jumper, and on finding no blouse, uncovered a breast and began biting it. I will admit it hurt a bit but I let her get on with it as I felt the damp patch growing between my shaking legs. Suddenly a ringing sound filled my ears - lunch-time was over. Jan left taking my pants with her, leaving me hers as a momento. I made sure that I was never alone with her again, although did notice how friendly she became with the swimming teacher in the weeks that followed. I wondered if Pauline had been a victim of Jan's toilet tears, or if Jan had managed to get her pants off. The one good thing that come out of all this was that it made me realise my sexuality. I now share my life with a lovely lady...Thanks for that Jan, I sometimes wonder though what you would have tasted like!!!!<br> By Linda</p> <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> </font></b></p> <!-- #EndEditable --></td>
