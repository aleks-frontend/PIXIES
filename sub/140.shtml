                          <td colspan="2" width="100%"> <!-- #BeginEditable "story" --> <p>Colleen could only smile to herself in her parents' cabin. She wanted to spend some time to herself and this was a two story home, deep in the forest. she loved the smell of the pines all the way there as she had the top down on her little blue Mirada. She stopped at the driveway to see the cabin again, it had been several years, Colleen thought back on her younger years coming to the cabin, times she had enjoyed. The times she loved. She thought about a boy she had meet up here, a neighbor and how they had planed to become great lovers of the world, they spent many hours thinking of what a great love life they could have together. It couldn't happen just then as they were both not quiet old enough but they both read many books visualizing how it could be for them both and how lucky grown ups are. Oh they spent times kissing and holding one another, feeling one another up, they built an unbreakable bond between them in there youth, they almost knew they would spend the rest of their lives together having children between them, they talked about how great their kids would be, they talked about just being together and living in this very cabin she was in. Home schooling their kids and teaching them how to survive in the wild. Smiling to herself, then letting the tears flow down her cheeks thinking back on how his parents had a car crash and the man of her dreams died along with his parents that were the best of folks. Colleen's tears filled her eyes as she thought of the past but she had always loved being in these woods.It was just harder nowadays.<br> She somehow felt she could be closer to her micheal, she could close her eyes and see him smiling back at her. Her heart was so heavy she couldn't imagine living her life without him. She knew he was her soul mate. She spent many hours a day just taking to him... Telling him how she was so lonely and wanted no other. She spent many evenings before bed sitting in front of the fireplace, the same place they both had sat many nights together. Colleen watched the fire dance over the logs she began talking to Micheal as if he were there, she told him how she longed for the day when they would meet and touch one again, Colleen was ready for sex now and she knew if he would have lived he would be also. She told God in her teared words how he was so unfair to her and Micheal. She didn't want to life out her life if she couldn't have at least one sexual encounter with Micheal, she begged as the tears ran all down her face. <br> Colleen was so beautiful with long flowing hair of a golden color her big blue eyes could take anyones thoughts right to her. She wept by the fireplace everynight for the first week she was there. She begged God to do something, anything...<br> She felt after several days God wasn't listening to her, her heart was crushed she asked. &quot;Please can I see an angel?&quot; Colleen felt a warming and bright light filling the den, she felt a kind of fear like no other she'd known. She turned and watched this bright light taking a form. The ceiling was twenty feet high and the angel's wings were within inches, it was this beautiful woman with long flowing clothing and her long soft curly hair all so bright and so real too!<br> Colleen droped to her knees, her tears flowed all down her face, she could see another form coming to be at the angel's side. It was Micheal! He was smiling at her. The Angel pulled him forward and then let loose of his hand and she disappeared as she just faded into thin air. The light in the room was only filled by the light of the fireplace in just seconds after. Micheal softly called to Colleen, he seemed to be wearing a white sheet of some kind. Colleen held out her hands to him, wanting so much to feel his touch once more. Their fingers meet, she felt the warmth in his hands.<br> He pulled her to his chest as they kissed once more. She could feel his hands exploring her back as she pressed her breasts into his chest. He began to explain what he had learned after he had died, a couple lives back he had raped women and he was just a bad person. When he meet Colleen he was to find the love of his life, but she would be taken from him as he was to die after falling in love. He was paying back debts from other life times. The angel's could hardly stand to watch Colleen weep so much as she was almost one of them, or she will be after she lived out this life... Micheal had learned so much about life and things about his past lives. He found he really didn't deserve Colleen. He learned that each of us had to really deserve eachother, we had to earn the love we all get from one another. Micheal had cried and told Colleen of all the things he learned. How he wished he had got swats in high school like his Dad did, or maybe something to keep him on the right track. He just tured wild. He knew deep down he was responsible for everything he ever did. We all are. Micheal slowly pushed Colleen back, saying she was to good for him, he was thinking back when he was alive in his last life with her, he could have and he did call for an angel manytimes but he was not worthy of such things. He had a very bad side to himself. It could all be made right but it would take several lives of doing good things and helping the people he had damaged in his last lives. There was no hurry for these things, he would be comming back to the earth several more lifetimes.<br> For Colleen she had already made herself a place in heaven, she had earned a peaceful and never ending life in a faraway land. After what Micheal had seen she had no idea how good things would be for her. They sat by the fireplace and talked of these things.<br> To Colleen Micheal seemed to have changed some, he didn't have the spunky and wild side to him, he was very calm much different. He didn't keep trying to find a way in her pants, he didn't suggest they try this or that just for the fun of it. She was missing these things Micheal had always done with her. She felt like some great door was closing between them. Micheal went on telling her how he still loved Colleen but she was going to have to wait till he was worthy of her, she didn't want to wait, she felt she had already waited long enough, she began caressing him through the sheet like material he was wearing, her touch was to hard for him to resist he could do nothing but let her stroke his long hard cock. He buried his face between her breasts and started kissing her, taking her blouse off Colleen wasn't wearing a bra as his eyes gazed over her lovely breasts he took her left nipple in his mouth. She seemed to almost be in heat like some big kitty cat. She wanted to feel the love they both used to talk about and all the many love stories she had read. She knew what went were and why but she wanted to feel it all for real. She pulled down her shorts and undies wanting to get this going, She pulled the sheet clothing off of Micheal. She found she loved holding his hot hard cock, they laid on the soft rug in front of the fireplace. She climbed over Micheal her knees on eachside of his head she lowered her hot pussy right to his mouth and he began licking to taste her for the first time. It was better than he could have ever imagined. Colleen had her hips going in a little circle never wanting him to stop...<br> She had been stroking Micheal's cock, and she dove her mouth down taking his cock deep in her mouth, his hips rose up wanting to feel himself way deep in her warm mouth, she loved this new feeling of having a cock filling her mouth, she could taste his precum, that made her start sucking him harder she wanted her mouth filled with his sperm. She had waited all these years and then to loose him thinking she would never get her due. Now to have him back from out of nowhere. She wanted to spend all the energy she had to experience all the fruits of their love.<br> Her body shook all over as she climaxed giving her pussy to Micheal's licking and sucking lips he softly bit at her gorgeous pussy feeling the warmth from the fireplace was far from his mind as he couldn't take Colleen's sucking mouth any longer. It felt as if she was sucking him dry, even after his last spurts of cum she continued sucking wanting even more. They finally rested beside one another for fifteen minutes. Colleen climbed up on Micheal rubbing her pussy over his simi hard cock, she kissed him so passionately wanting him to be her super lover, loving this time they get together. She rode him like she was trying to stay on one of those machanical bulls. Micheal was doing his very best to fuck her good, they made love so many times that night Colleen lost count but it was all so good she loved every minute of that night, it was way better than she thought it would be...<br> She woke in the late morning with a wonderful smile on her face, turning over looking for Micheal. He was gone! The angel came and took him back... She remembered asking God if she could have him even for just one night and she must have got what she asked for. But she was hungry for more of this sex stuff. She wanted to love and be loved all the time now. It was something she wanted more than anything now. She was hungry for it. She thought she should get dressed and go jogging maybe she would meet another guy, the sooner the better! <br> As she was jogging down the country roads and smelling all the pines loving life she talked to micheal in her head as she ran, telling him she had to have another man maybe many more but she hoped in the end, he and she would be together forever and that she would always love him. But as things do happen she heard the patter of feet coming along side her and she slowed down and he introduced himself as Paul, a nice young man with a great body and a nice smile too. She put out her hand and said. &quot;Hi I'm Colleen nice to meet you, ahh do you know anything about fireplaces?&quot; He smiled bigtime and said. &quot;I'd love to learn all about yours.&quot;<br> By Dave Evans<br> Comments to <a href="mailto:evansinno@zianet.com">evansinno@zianet.com</a></p> <!-- #EndEditable --></td>
