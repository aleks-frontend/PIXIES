        <p>The tower had always been on my famillies land dark and brooding it 
          had stood there for centruries rotting. &quot;Let It rot&quot; my father 
          would say some nights sitting in the palor staring out the window. THis 
          nose red from the acholol he inbided. That tower had always held my 
          imagination a fourstorie structure of beautiful simplicity it was to 
          become my sate harbor in my unhappy childhood and the obessions of my 
          adult life.<br>
          At seven i began to explore the tower out of curiousity and the fact 
          it was the one spot my father would not look for me i spent many a day 
          in the ancient interior pretending to be a great lord, or some arcane 
          wizard unlocking the secrets of life. At the age of eighteen it became 
          my sole inhertance due to my fathers untimely death and back taxes, 
          taking the rest of the property. I moved in there with tripedation and 
          a snse of forboding knowing that i would never be able to afford to 
          keep the place loong.<br>
          My first night there dreams took me to the tower in its hey day, i was 
          a page for the preist and nuns who lived their an errand boy and general 
          handy man i worked long and hard there til the time came for me to take 
          my vows, but i had fallen in love, darkcowled figures chased me hunted 
          me down and as the rope slid down my neck darkness consumed me. I jerked 
          awake sweat flowing freely from my brow. Wildly i looked up to sees 
          her the girl from my dream a lovely vision of helath and beauty she 
          stared at me not moving still in her habit then she was gone the scent 
          of moist earth clung to the air and me. I lay there my heart pounding 
          in my chest the darkness of the room unsettleing my nerves even further 
          than her. I felt tears stream down from my eyes, and my neck burned 
          . i heard laughter suddenly to my right and saw a dark robed friar standing 
          there starieng at me pointing accuseingly his eyes bleeding. Iscreamed 
          then and lost concoscoius thought.<br>
          Morning streamed throught the windows and hit me in the eyes the nights 
          events where laid forgotten on my pillow as i got out of bed and walked 
          across the floor i stood in front of the mirror that had come with this 
          room it had cracked somehow in the night i stood in horror as i saw 
          rope burns across my throat and a woman with here back to me in the 
          corner i turned around but there was noone there. I looked back at the 
          mirror she stood in front of me again the woman from the night before 
          her arms out calling to me her eyes imploring as she faded away.<br>
