The new responsibility would transform her life, she was sure of it. At the very least, she wouldn't have to leave for work so very early in the morning from now on. It did mean that she would have to be just that little bit more careful about how few clothes she wore to work, just as she had to be coming home. <br> Her home was a three bedroom flat she shared with two other girls. Her closest friend, Charlotte, was in the room adjacent to hers, with a connecting door which was usually left open. Charlotte wasn't a naturist but she wore no clothes round the home, apparently from respect for Emma. Indeed, Charlotte had quite good dress sense which was useful for Emma whenever she needed to borrow a dress or a coat to go shopping or to work. Charlotte also claimed to be a lesbian, which was strange because she never once brought a woman friend back home with her. She did, however, come home with male friends on a not too regular basis and judging by the very noisy reception she gave them, Emma felt no reason to doubt Charlotte's passion. Nevertheless, it was a little embarrassing how on the more regular occasions Charlotte got a little tipsy, she would declare her love for Emma. <br> Charlotte worked for the Civil Service, but envied the glamour of Emma's job. She would put her head on Emma's lap to have her hair stroked and entice Emma to tell her once again about the famous guests on her programs and the more sexy television encounters. Emma had a mostly professional pride in this as in almost all cases the most successful interviews were those she had most meticulously planned. <br> The other flat?mate was Harriett who was a presenter on a rival station to Harlot TV, called Semen South West, (which did not reflect any regional bias). SSW was a Three X station that had only recently obtained its third X, so Harriett had needed some re?training. It was no longer sufficient for her merely to stimulate penises: she now also had to bring them to ejaculation. It was more important for her to maintain her composure when she might have to make love with several people in a single half?hour program. The show she presented was called Swimming Pool Sex, which generally featured her in the various athletic positions she could adopt in a swimming pool. This meant that she had to be a very good swimmer as well as a sexual athlete. The extra X meant it was more important than ever to heave the penis out of the water at the moment of ejaculation so that all could be shown to the cameras. <br> Harriett was obsessed by the art and technique of her trade. She often watched sex television to learn from other presenters and her conversations frequently drifted towards what she had done in a recent program or what she was practising for her next program. She undoubtedly practised: barely a night went by with Harriett not bringing home a man, often the night before they were due to perform together on television. <br> Harriett had one professional worry which was that the extra X might oblige her to make love to a woman. It was not the professional aspect that bothered her, but her worries about doing something that as a heterosexual she wouldn't really enjoy. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; she would ask Charlotte as sweetly as she could, &quot;I could lose some of my fear if I practised with you.&quot; Curiously, for a lesbian with little compunction for sex with men, Charlotte appeared to have very little interest in accepting this offer. <br> Emma would be seeing much more of her flatmates, now that her work would be mostly done at home. <br> The first batch of videos Emma identified as worth exploring were known as Naturist Classics, produced by a small European production company. At present, they were not broadcast on any national television stations but were nonetheless selling quite respectably in video rentals. As a naturist, this rather intrigued Emma and she thought that her exploration should start somewhere where it might coincide with her own interests. <br> The practise of Naturist Classics was to take a piece of well? known literature or drama and present it in the nude. This meant naked Wuthering Heights, naked David Copperfield and naked Passage To India. As Emma soon found out these were virtually unchanged from the original text, apart from that the cast wore no clothes, however apparently inappropriate this might seem even to Emma. The appeal of these videos at first eluded Emma, and she could see no objection to screening these films on day?time national television. In the case of Lady Chatterly's Lover, Nana and Tom Jones she wasn't too surprised that the sex scenes were considerably more explicit, more prominent in the plot and more frequent than in the original novels, so perhaps that was why they were destined for specialist tastes. However, Emma couldn't really recall that there had been sex scenes in the originals of Jane Eyre, Moby Dick and Anna Karenin, but she accepted the licence for them to be in the naturist versions. <br> From a technical perspective, the films were very curiously filmed, but it took Emma a while to determine why. &quot;It's all in medium to long shot,&quot; explained Harriett, who had a professional interest in how much was required to be shown in a shot. Indeed, unlike most television drama, the scenes were set up so that as much of the main characters torso and genitalia would be on screen in any frame. Furthermore, it soon became clear that however innocent the content of the scene the characters always seemed to be sexually aroused. Mouths pouted unnaturally, the vulva and nipples were unusually bright and either the men were always half?aroused or had been stimulated to be so. In any case, their penises never resembled the shrivelled little things that Emma more often associated with naturist men, but more like Harlot TV male presenters as they were readying themselves. <br> More investigation revealed more of the appeal of Naturist Classics. Although less than a half of its listing consisted of children's classics, more than 80% of its sales were of these videos. It seemed unlikely to Emma that there were that many naturist children, so she took an especial interest in these films. <br> Like the adult canon, the children's classics featured all their cast of mostly children in the nude. Again, the content was ostensibly quite innocent, if a bit bizarre. A naturist Swallows and Amazons featured the two gangs of children running around naked, with rather young and well?developed parents who often seemed more fond of their children than seemed normal, but not obscenely so. A naturist Famous Five again featured naked children, who if anything were younger than those in Enid Blyton's books. A naturist Alice in Wonderland featured a naked six year old girl who seemed overawed by the nearly tumescent penises and swelling nipples of the not very well disguised actors playing the managerie of fantastic characters. <br> Emma came to the conclusion that, sadly, the role of Naturist Classics was ostensibly to provide titillating images of naked children in absurd situations for those who liked that sort of thing. The lack of overt sex, at least with children, and the plots which conformed to a certain extent to their source material, didn't detract at all from the titillation this was no doubt meant to provide. Emma could see a role for Naturist Classics on Harlot TV, and certainly the content fell well within the bounds of what was permitted for a Four X station. The question would be its scheduling. Mid?afternoon, she decided. The titillatory value was best served by keeping up the pretence that it was educational entertainment, but it was necessary to keep an eye on the content to ensure it never got emboldened to the extent of actually showing child sex, which was totally illegal. <br> A more difficult question which Emma fortunately didn't need to worry about with Naturist Classics was where to draw the line on what constitutes child sex. The affection that a lot of the children seemed unabashed about expressing to each other, especially in The Railway Children, which hinted obliquely at incest, kept sufficiently clear of the genitals or the anus not to be considered sex, but would that have been so true if adults were equally as affectionate with the children? <br> &quot;Would you perform in a film like this?&quot; Emma asked Harriett who was languidly watching Oliver Twist. The scene showed the children in Fagin's den holding each other tight against the cold, including some little girls, while a naked Artful Dodger was striding up and down with a half?tumescent sub?teen penis. <br> &quot;Why not,&quot; Harriett yawned. &quot;At least if you get something wrong on a film, it can be re?recorded. When you slip up on live television, then everyone can see!&quot; Albania had taken a very strange turn in its pornographic industry. From a period when it would let virtually anything go, Albanian hard core porn now prohibited the sexual act. However, excretion hadn't been proscribed and although there wasn't much of a demand for coprophilia, urination was now used as an acceptable metaphor for sex. Consequently, Albanian pornography was now known as Piss TV, because that is precisely what there was a lot of. <br> Although Emma couldn't imagine the appeal herself, she sat herself in front of a pile of videos from Albania with Charlotte for a second opinion. Charlotte didn't enjoy pornography at the best of times, but she felt lonely and needed some attention which Emma indulgently provided. Indeed, Charlotte scarcely watched the videos at all. She simply rested her head on Emma's naked lap and purred into her warm crotch. When she got restive she'd take a hair from Emma's crotch in her teeth and stretch it out until Emma had to stop her. <br> Emma couldn't speak a word of Albanian and the videos were neither subtitled nor dubbed. They had fairly conventional story?lines, neither better nor worse than those which dominated national pornography. They were essentially variations on the theme of sexually attracted individuals coming together and consummating their passion on often the most arbitrary of excuses and with sufficient aspects of kinkiness to maintain some level of interest. However, the crucial difference was that, whereas in most pornographic films the sexual encounters would involve some kind of stimulation of the genitals and penetration of an orifice, in Albanian films one or the other would start peeing all over the partner or partners. There were scenes of women pissing on men's faces, clothes, genitals and hair, and men doing much the same to women. <br> Sexual perversions by use of this metaphor were actually more commonly shown of children pissing on each other, parents pissing on children, animals being pissed on and so on. In only a minority of films was the urine licked or ingested by one of the protagonists, but this was clearly a growing trend as demonstrated in the more recent films. <br> &quot;Uhh! How awful!&quot; groaned Charlotte in one scene as one man pissed straight into the mouths of two apparently enthusiastic women who then proceeded to lick the urine off each other. <br> &quot;I'm sure it's not real piss,&quot; said Emma reassuringly. This wasn't her real opinion, as she knew too well from working at Harlot TV, the viewers wanted to be sure that what they were seeing had at one time actually happened. She wasn't sure what market there could be for Piss Television on Harlot TV, but perhaps repackaged as a &quot;Golden Showers&quot; feature with some studio participation it could become the basis for something of interest to viewers. &quot;Is there anything about these films you like?&quot; Emma solicited of Charlotte. <br> &quot;I like the language,&quot; Charlotte giggled. <br> &quot;But besides that. I mean could you imagine wanting to watch someone piss on TV?&quot; <br> &quot;I can't. But ask Harriett. I'm sure her guests are always pissing in her swimming pool.&quot; <br> Harriett didn't much like the films either. &quot;There's no physical element. They just stand apart and piss on each other. And its unhygienic.&quot; <br> So, Emma thought, a health warning would need to be included, and it might be difficult getting the ingestion and licking episodes past the censors for hygienic reasons alone. However, her instinct told her that if people in Albania were happy to see films about people pissing on each other, they probably would be at home. Her concept of &quot;Golden Showers&quot; was developing. <br> &quot;Perhaps we could get guests to show how far they can piss. Have sort of pissing games ? you know for accuracy and volume. Have a comp&eacute;re who would always have urine stains on her dress. Show people pissing in public places. And show snippets of these films in the program.&quot; <br> &quot;Well, I wouldn't want to watch it,&quot; asserted Charlotte. <br> &quot;And I wouldn't dream of appearing on it,&quot; said Harriett. &quot;The only reason you're interested in this, Emma, is that there's no sex in pissing and you don't like sex.&quot; <br> &quot;Yes, sweetness,&quot; laughed Charlotte. &quot;You could do the show and still be a virgin!&quot; <br> Emma blushed. &quot;I'm sure ? you know ? well ...&quot; <br> Charlotte smothered Emma's face with affectionate kisses. &quot;Oh, you're such a sweetie! I love you! I really love you! Please please let me make love to you.&quot; <br> &quot;No!&quot; said Emma firmly, pleased to be in a position of power again. <b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> </font> </b></p> <!-- #EndEditable --></td>
