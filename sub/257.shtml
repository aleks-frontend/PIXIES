            <td colspan="2" width="100%"> <!-- #BeginEditable "story" --> <p>A few weeks ago my wife, Bonnie, and I made a bet on something we were both absolutely certain we were right about. The bet was for one evening of whatever the winner wants - total control. I won, and Bonnie was appalled. I am always trying to talk her into letting me show off her body more, like flashing truckers on the highway or getting caught undressed when our next door neighbor, Frank, is over. She will occasionally let a button &quot;accidentally&quot; come open when he is around if she's had a couple of beers, but voluntarily showing a breast or her pussy is too much for her. She knows it is a turn-on for me, but it is very difficult to get past her modesty. When I won this bet she was VERY nervous, because she knew what I would want her to do. But give her credit: she didn't try to back out of the bet. <p> The evening before I claimed my winnings, I talked to Frank about my plans, and he was more than willing to help out. I started off the evening by taking her to The Melting Pot, a fondue restaurant here in Richmond. <p> It is very nice - dark and romantic. We were seated in a booth in a small room. It was early enough that we were the only ones in the room. After we had ordered our first drink, I told her to unbutton another button on her dress. This would open it to just below her breasts. Since I had vetoed any underwear, when she did she was more exposed than she ever had been in public. She sat up straight to keep the dress from opening too much, but as we ate and drank our wine she relaxed and seemed to forget about how exposed she was. She was sitting leaning forward a bit with her shoulders sort of slumped, and the view was wonderful. I could see some of both breasts, nearly to the aureole. <p> Before desert arrived I told her to unbutton one more button. Her dress was now open to well below her breasts. When she sat up straight you couldn't see much. But when she would lean forward to take a bite of desert it would fall away from her body and I could see most of both breasts, including her nipples. The drinks and wine had had an effect, and she soon grew careless, leaning forward and allowing me to enjoy the view. I told her I loved the way she looked, and to keep sitting that way. She was embarrassed, but did as I told her. <p> Our waiter arrived to clear the desert and offer us an after dinner drink. When Bonnie saw him she gave a little start and straightened up. With him standing right there I said, &quot;Bonnie, tell Aaron what our arrangement is tonight.&quot; He looked at me with a puzzled expression, then at Bonnie. She looked down at the table and said, just as I had made her agree before we left home, &quot;I have to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, with no argument and no hesitation.&quot; I said, &quot;Good girl,&quot; then explained to Aaron that she had lost a bet, and this was how she was paying it off. He grinned as he began to understand. <p> &quot;Now, Bonnie,&quot; I said, &quot;that's not how I told you to sit, is it?&quot; Still looking down at the table she shook her head. &quot;Show Aaron how you were sitting before he walked up.&quot; She hesitated and looked at me without moving, nervously biting her lip. This was what she had been afraid of. She said, &quot;I don't think I can do this.&quot; I replied, &quot;Come on, Bonnie. You have to do it. You made the bet, now it's time to pay up. Aaron won't mind, will you?&quot; &quot;Hey, not a bit&quot;, he said, guessing what was coming. Bonnie took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and slowly did as she was told. The top of her dress fell forward again and gaped open, and we could both see her breasts right down to the nipples. What a turn-on! <p> &quot;That's much better&quot;, I said. &quot;Now, Bonnie, you did what I told you to do, but it wasn't without hesitation, the way you agreed. You are going to have to pay a penalty to remind you not to hesitate when I tell you to do something this evening. Unbutton another button.&quot;&quot; Reluctantly, she did. The dress was now unbuttoned clear to her waist. &quot;Good girl. Now open the dress and give Aaron a good look at what you were embarrassed to let him see the first time.&quot; Her eyes opened wide, and she looked across the table at me you could see the color drain from her face. He had already seen her breasts, but actively showing them to him was a very big step. &quot;Are you hesitating?&quot; &quot;No!&quot; she said quickly, then slowly reached up and took hold of the sides of her dress. Glancing around the room to make sure there was no one else who could see, she opened it briefly, the immediately closed it again. <p> &quot;Way too fast, Honey. Do it again, but this time hold the dress open until I tell you to close it.&quot; She closed her eyes again and parted the material, letting her gorgeous tits spill out. Aaron was transfixed. He stared at her breasts and said, &quot;Wow! Excellent!&quot; &quot;That's not so difficult, is it, Darling? Now look at Aaron and thank him for the compliment. Then you can close your dress and button that one button,&quot; I told her. She was absolutely scarlet, but did as she was told. <p> &quot;So did you learn anything?&quot; I asked when he left to get our after diner drinks. &quot;Yes. If I don't do what you tell me to do, the punishment is worse than what I would have had to do in the first place.&quot; &quot;Very good. Remember that, because you still have another penalty coming. Now go back to sitting like you were, and stay that way when Aaron comes back.&quot; She did as she was told, and when he returned with our drinks she stayed that way. <p> Aaron stood beside the table after he brought the drinks and again complimented Bonnie on her beautiful breasts. She giggled and blushed again and thanked him. &quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;thank you for showing them to me. I really enjoyed it.&quot; &quot;She really does have beautiful body, doesn't she?&quot; I replied. &quot;I'm glad you enjoyed seeing it. And I appreciate you helping her pay off the bet. In fact, if you don't mind, I'd like you to help her out just a little bit more. Remember she earned another penalty so she's not quite done yet. If it's OK with you when she finishes her drink we'll have her pay off that one, too, before we leave.&quot;<p> It was like asking a man dying of thirst if he'd mind drinking a glass of water. He was grinning from ear to ear when he said he'd be back in a few minutes.<p> Bonnie was, to say the least, apprehensive. &quot;What are you going to do?&quot; she asked. I told her just to relax and enjoy her drink. I wasn't going to have her do anything all that terrible. &quot;And remember, you did lose the bet. You promised to do whatever I asked without hesitation or argument, and you haven't been very good about doing that. I'm going to help you remember not to break your promises.&quot; She still looked apprehensive. Be honest, Bonnie: haven't you found this just a little bit exciting?&quot; &quot;Well, I guess so&quot;, she replied. &quot;But it's embarrassing, too, letting a total stranger see my naked tits.&quot; &quot;You have beautiful naked tits&quot;, I said, &quot;and you should be proud of them. Aaron even told you how much he enjoyed seeing you, and letting another guy see your body is a huge turn-on for me.&quot; &quot;Aren't you jealous when someone else sees me?&quot; she asked. &quot;No, Honey, I'm not jealous at all. I'm excited, and I'm proud of you, but I'm not jealous.&quot; <p> With impeccable timing, Aaron chose that minute to come back in. &quot;Everything OK here?&quot; he asked, grinning. &quot;Everything is super here, Aaron. The only thing that would make it better is if I could have Bonnie pay off that last penalty,&quot; I replied. &quot;Well, I'd be glad to help out with that, too,&quot; he answered. &quot;That's really nice of you, Aaron. I appreciate the help, and I know Bonnie appreciates it, too. Right, Honey?&quot; Bonnie nodded. &quot;Good. Let's go ahead and pay off that penalty, then. Bonnie, Aaron has already seen your tits. I know that was hard for you to do, but I guess it wasn't enough to help you remember to do what I say without hesitation or argument. So let's try something else. Raise your skirt and show him what you are wearing under the dress.&quot; Since I vetoed underwear, what she was wearing, of course, was nothing. &quot;Tom, no! I really can't do that. We're in public and I'm naked under there, for God's sake!&quot; &quot;I know, Bonnie. That's why I want you to show him. And because you're still arguing, obviously you haven't learned yet. Maybe this will do the trick. Go ahead.&quot; &quot;But Tom . . . !&quot; &quot;No, Bonnie. You are not getting out of this. You promised, and you have to do it. Raise your skirt. Now!&quot; <p> I almost felt sorry for her. She looked like a trapped animal. She looked from me to Aaron, and back to me. There was no way out. I pulled the table over toward me and said softly, &quot;Go ahead, Bonnie.&quot; Reluctantly, she reached down and gathered the material of her dress in both hands and began to pull it up her thighs. When she reached the top of her thighs she looked at me again and I said, &quot;Pull it out from under you and sit on the bench.&quot; She did. &quot;Now raise the front all the way to your waist.&quot; &quot;OK, here goes!&quot; she said, and pulled it all the way up. There she sat, legs together, holding her dress up so we could both see her the hair between her legs. &quot;Stay just like that. Look at me, Bonnie,&quot; I said. &quot;Now, if you hadn't argued yet again, this is all you would have had to do. But you did, so you earned another penalty. Are you going to argue about this one, too?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; she said. I won't argue any more.&quot; &quot;Good.&quot; I slid out of the booth and stood beside Aaron. I said. &quot;Here is what you are going to do. I want you to turn toward us and put your feet up on the bench.&quot; She did it, and her dress stayed up on her hips. &quot;Now spread your knees all the way apart and sit there until I tell you that you can move.&quot; As she slowly she opened her legs her vagina came into view. The labia opened like a flower, and we could see the moisture glistening in the light. &quot;Now spread yourself open with your fingers and let us get a good long look at your pussy.&quot; She whimpered a little, but did as I told her to do. &quot;Please, Honey,&quot; she whispered. &quot;that's enough.&quot; &quot;Not quite yet, Bonnie. We're not through looking. Well, Aaron, what do you think?&quot; &quot;It's beautiful!&quot; he said, fascinated by the sight. &quot;Yes, it certainly is,&quot; I agreed. After a moment more I said &quot;OK, Bonnie, we're done. Your bet it paid off.&quot;<p> With shaking hands Bonnie lit a cigarette. &quot;I am so embarrassed and so excited I have got to get out of here. Can we go home now?&quot; I left money for our check. We didn't see Aaron on the way out. No doubt he had gone to the rest room to relieve the sexual tension. As soon as we got home Bonnie was all over me. If it were physically possible for a woman to rape a man, that's what would have happened as soon as we walked in the door. <p> When we stopped to catch our breath, Bonnie said, &quot;I can hardly wait for our next bet.&quot; Me too!<b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> </font> </b></p> <!-- #EndEditable --></td>
