No more than Innocence did she like to feel part of a freak show.<br> &quot;If they expect the two of us to make love together in front of them, they're going to be very disappointed,&quot; Alice announced. Dinah was always inviting guests to stay at the apartment the two sisters shared, and, to be honest, Alice was never very enthusiastic about the sex games Dinah tried getting her to participate in. She couldn't really appreciate Dinah's argument that because they were no longer living with their parents, they should do exactly what they wanted.<br> However, Alice didn't feel so troubled when she was introduced to Chastity and Innocence. Chastity, Alice felt, was a girl much like her sister, if anything just a little more self-confident and exuded more of an air of promiscuity. Innocence was very different. She was a girl much the same age as Alice herself, and very pretty as well. She was dressed in such a sweet blue dress down to her knees with a pretty blue bow around the waist and dainty little shoes and white socks. Her face shone with an air of trust and hope, and her long hair swept down to her waist. Alice wore what she always wore at home, which was nothing, so Innocence could see Alice's newly formed fifteen-year old body - her small breasts totally hidden by the long bush of hair that flowed down her front.<br> Alice wasn't at all surprised when Chastity took her cue from Alice and Dinah's nudity, and within minutes of being introduced had taken off all her clothes. Innocence, however, did nothing of the sort, and indeed seemed somewhat discomfited by being with three naked women. Alice had not always been a naturist - and indeed she couldn't really say she was one now. It just seemed natural never to bother, with Dinah not wearing clothes anymore, and most of Dinah's friends doing the same. If nothing else, it meant less trouble in the morning when preparing for the day.<br> The four girls chatted in the living room, and Alice was relieved that the subject of incest didn't come up. Although she enjoyed making love to Dinah, it wasn't something she wanted to make an issue of, and in fact was a little embarrassed about. She actually felt a little disgusted at the idea of Chastity, who was eighteen - just two years younger than Dinah - making love to such a sweet girl as Innocence. Clearly, Innocence wasn't as comfortable talking about sex and lovers as Dinah and Chastity were. Alice chatted to Innocence mostly about her school-life and what her hometown was like. They also chatted about Blanche and the district of Brook that Innocence had never visited. As Alice explained, she felt that Brook, although a delightful place in many ways, was not really where she felt most at home. <br> It came as little surprise to Alice to see Dinah and Chastity become increasingly affectionate with each other, leading to them kissing each other. When Dinah announced that she and Chastity would be going to the guest bedroom together, Alice declined the offer of joining them. Innocence wasn't asked, and Alice was sure she would also have refused anyway.<br> When evening came, Dinah announced that she would be sleeping with Chastity, so Innocence could share the bed with Alice. The two girls' apartment consisted of only two bedrooms and a living room, so Innocence had only the choice of the sofa or the bed with Alice. Alice accepted the offer, as she was sure that sleeping with Innocence wasn't going to be one of those situations where she'd feel obliged to make love. Despite this, Alice was attracted to Innocence: there weren't very many women as pretty as she.<br> When bedtime came, Alice washed herself in the tiny bathroom and towelled herself dry before jumping into the bed. While in the bathroom, she could hear Dinah and Chastity making the loud noises of lovemaking. Dinah's probably brought out the sexual accessories, thought Alice, thinking of the cupboard full of dildos and vibrators. When Innocence went to bed, though, she went into the bathroom fully clothed and came out after several minutes fresh-smelling and wearing a white cotton nightie down to her ankles. Innocence walked into the bedroom carrying her clothes in her arms and saw Alice lying prone on her back on the back masturbating at the thought of Dinah and Chastity's lovemaking which was now loud enough to be heard through the walls. Innocence put the clothes down and stood back watching Alice's fingers exercise her crotch. Innocence felt simultaneously embarrassed and aroused. She was too embarrassed just to enter the bed while Alice was so engaged, but as she stood by the door she began to get embarrassed for a different reason as her prick got aroused and was beginning to stand out very obviously against her nightgown.<br> Alice saw Innocence standing quietly by the door, but thought nothing of it - except it was strange that she should be wearing a nightgown. As she examined the nightgown from her position with her head against the pillow, she noticed that there was a very strange protuberance around the waist. It pushed out the nightgown at least seven inches from Innocence's waist and Alice couldn't think what it might be. Overcome with curiosity and with the fingers of her left hand still rubbing away at her crotch, she leaned over and put the fingers of her right hand on this protuberance.<br> It was a sausage-shaped, stiff, but warm protuberance which Alice felt through the nightgown and which Alice recognised very well. But that was impossible! Her other hand disengaged itself from her crotch and both hands felt it under the nightgown. &quot;I thought you were a girl!&quot; she exclaimed in surprise.<br> &quot;I am!&quot; said Innocence sadly.<br> Alice pulled up Innocence's nightie to the waist so that her penis stuck out raw and pink and hard. Alice ran her fingers down the length of it from the hair at the crotch to the pink glans. &quot;This says you're not.&quot;<br> Innocence gently pulled the rest of her nightgown up and over her head. She shook her hair loose as she freed it from her shoulders. &quot;I am!&quot; she insisted.<br> Alice could see what Innocence meant. Except for the lack of vagina, and the presence of this penis, nobody could doubt that Innocence was a woman. She had flesh in exactly the right places, and her breasts were as round and well-formed as any that Alice had seen. Without her clothes, Innocence was even more attractive, and Alice felt her heart melt like hot wax as she contemplated her. <br> &quot;You're so beautiful!&quot; she cried throwing herself onto Innocence and guiding her backwards on to the bed. Alice sat aspread Innocence's thighs and studied her body. She stroked the legs and smooth taut stomach with her hands. &quot;So beautiful!&quot; She looked at Innocence's erect prick, and there was no doubt that there was some reciprocity of feeling. Alice brought her mouth down over the end of it and exercised it with her lips and tongue. It shone and glistened with the bedroom light reflected in its smooth wetness.<br> It wasn't too long until Alice had guided Innocence's penis inside her cunt, and Alice's own cries of pleasure joined those of Chastity and Dinah. Innocence was a girl who despite her apparent demureness was easily sexually aroused and thanks to Purity and Chastity much practised in the art of making love. Alice hadn't had such a passionate night of love for a very long time, and her reservations about the oddball couple were soon forgotten.<br> Several hours later, while Innocence lay asleep in her arms, Alice studied the blissfully sleeping form. With such an unusual encumbrance Innocence was a girl destined for unhappiness, but one who would also give so much pleasure to other people. Alice listened to the faint roar of steam trains in the distance as they left for their destinations. Perhaps somewhere, Alice reasoned, there may be a place where Innocence wouldn't be such a freak.<br> Alice had many friends, one of which was Mouse whose unannounced visits she had got rather used rather accustomed to. Now that Mouse was an actress, her life seemed to have no routine except when she was in a performance somewhere. As Mouse was soon to be playing Cordelia in a performance of King Lear, Alice had been expecting Mouse to descend on her at any time. <br> She perhaps didn't expect Mouse to arrive while she and Innocence were making love in Alice's bedroom, but Mouse was not at all embarrassed. She was rather more fascinated by Innocence's penis. She stood back, in only a psychedelic tee-shirt and nothing else besides a collection of bangles and bracelets, and watched as Innocence's penis thrust in and out of Alice's cunt and as Alice grunted rhythmically in pleasure. It startled Alice when, after Innocence had spurted out her semen into Alice's mouth (so much better than having it drip down the thighs), Mouse introduced herself. <br> While Mouse and the girls chatted, she held onto Innocence's prick and stroked it with her fingers. &quot;It's so perfect!&quot; She commented. &quot;A girl with a penis - paradise indeed!&quot; Innocence's ever-ready member swelled and throbbed under the attention, but Alice wasn't too keen on seeing her new lover make love to Mouse, so she tactfully eased Innocence away from Mouse. She noticed that Mouse was still shaving her vulva although her hair was now long and flowing - nearly to her waist. This was necessary, Mouse told her, for a role in a Shakespearian play. <br> Mouse pointedly ignored Alice's attempt to separate her from Innocence and her hand massaged Innocence's prick the more vigorously. &quot;Why do you have to do that?&quot; asked Alice exasperatedly. <br> &quot;Well,&quot; answered Mouse, &quot;I've got to get some practice for King Lear. It's a modernised version and I've got to make love with at least two men in the three hours of the performance - so I've got to stay in trim.&quot; <br> &quot;When is the performance?&quot; wondered Alice. <br> &quot;It starts in just two months time, but we've not even started the rehearsals. I've got the script though. It's mostly the original Shakespeare, but there's a lot more sex in it and some of the boring bits have been taken out. I've seen the costume I've got to wear and it's really groovy. It's meant to be authentic Celtic - and as we know these Celts didn't wear much, especially when they were fighting. It's just a head-dress, boots and a sort of thong which doesn't hide anything.&quot; <br> It took Mouse a bit of persistence, but eventually she persuaded both Alice and Innocence to help her with rehearsing her part in King Lear. To be authentic, it would involve Mouse making love to Innocence. Mouse would play the part of Cordelia, Innocence the relevant male characters and Alice would play all the others. It was also necessary, Mouse said, for them all to be naked - but Alice saw this didn't mean Mouse shedding any of her jewellery. She pulled off her top to display her well-rounded breasts which certainly couldn't disguise themselves under the flimsy tee-shirts she chose to wear these days. <br> This version of King Lear was markedly different to the version that either Innocence or Alice had read at school. The first scene was essentially an incest scene. It featured King Lear, played by Innocence, who had decided to make love to his daughters to impregnate them so that only the purest royal blood would flow in the veins of their children. Both Regan and Goneril, both of whom played by Alice, readily agreed - and most of the first act involved Alice and Innocence making love. The stage directions for the love-making were quite specific and required full penetration by King Lear. Alice quite enjoyed this, though Mouse seemed relatively frustrated as Cordelia really had very little to do except masturbate (which wasn't in the script, but Mouse claimed that this kind of ad-libbing was perfectly reasonable). <br> Both Alice and Innocence were quite happy when they had to switch roles halfway through the act, after King Lear, who was still humping away at Regan, asked Cordelia to join in. As was required Cordelia refused and Innocence, holding the script up in one hand with her penis still deep inside Alice, ranted at her. The reason for Cordelia's reluctance was less to do with an aversion to incest (which Mouse insisted was quite common amongst Celts) than to do with her father's pride. After this, Alice took over the role of King Lear and other people, and Innocence took over the role of Cordelia's suitors. The act required Cordelia to have love made to her first by Burgundy and then by France, both played by Innocence. This involved fellatio for Burgundy and full sex with France. At the end of the scene, Innocence was totally exhausted and found it difficult to pronounce her lines. Alice noticed how very professional Mouse had become in her role, barely skipping a word or a studied nuance however frantic the love-making. <br> Cordelia's next appearance in King Lear was right at the end of the play, so the three girls didn't have to rehearse any of the intervening acts or scenes. However as Alice noticed, this involved the King making love with the Fool who was described as ambisexual and for whom all sex had to be anal. It also involved sex between Edgar and the Fool, three-way sex with Edmund, Regan and Goneril, and several scenes of cunnilingus, fellatio and masturbation. She was pleased to see no equivalent of Gloucester's scene of having his eyes cut out. Indeed, if anything, this production was actually less sadistic than the original version. <br> The last scene began with France and Cordelia making love while various of the significant characters - including a much reduced role for Kent - came and went apparently unabashed. Again Innocence played France, and as this involved several stage directions requiring some rather peculiar sexual positions, she found it quite a strain. &quot;I'm sure,&quot; Innocence remarked, &quot;that a man is much more flexible than me.&quot; <br> &quot;It's only practice that does it,&quot; Mouse replied. <br> Innocence had to rest for a while after playing that role, and examined herself for bruises - one of which between her thighs was clear evidence of the acrobatic excesses expected of modern theatre. After that the three girls had to play the final act which required Lear, played by Innocence, to make love to a dead Cordelia, who had just been hanged. This role was quite difficult, and Alice was aware that the actor who had to play Lear on stage was going to have a difficult time. He would be required to make love with six or seven different people, change his character from an egotistical monster to something more like a normal sex maniac and still remember some quite awkward lines. The art of the last scene, as Mouse explained, was not just to show Lear's remorse, but to show necrophilia in a positive light. Her part, which was to make no response except a shudder during the &quot;Never never never never never&quot; speech, required the skill to play dead and express no sexual excitement. &quot;The exact opposite,&quot; she pointed out, &quot;of what's normally expected of an actress.&quot; <br> The three girls, on Mouse's insistence, rehearsed the scenes several times, and Alice could see, from a dispassionate professional view, that Mouse's performance was improving. But as it involved making love to Innocence, who was quite clearly rather enjoying it, the whole affair was not of overwhelming appeal to her. It also came as no surprise to her, that as the days passed, Innocence left Alice's bed, and she and Mouse began sleeping together on the bed-settee in the living room. To a certain extent, Alice rather welcomed being able to sleep alone again. On the other hand, despite the fact that she and Innocence would still occasionally make love, it still troubled her to see Mouse and Innocence sitting together with their clothes tossed aside and Mouse's hand invariably grasping Innocence's penis. In fact, Mouse's hand and Innocence's penis hardly ever seemed to be apart.<br> When Alice heard that her friend Kedi was visiting, she felt a real tremble of excitement. She had never loved anyone as much as she loved Kedi and the thought of making love to her again made her flesh tingle and her body feel warm. Kedi was coming in by train, so it was with great enthusiasm that Alice volunteered to wait for Kedi at the railway station. <br> Alice arrived early just in case Kedi's train should also be early, but no! In fact it was late, and she sat disconsolately on the platform, watching people getting on and off the trains. There were people travelling from all over. Some Alice kept her eye on as they walked by, almost hoping that they would satisfy the lust she was feeling. Soon, however, Kedi did arrive. As a concession to public decency, she wore clothes but as always as little as she could. In fact, she wore nothing on her slim black body but a pair of shorts and not even a pair of shoes. Most people wore more than that and so Kedi's breasts attracted a great deal of attention. Alice herself, knowing of Kedi's arrival, wore as little as she dared - which was a tee-shirt and a pair of very brief shorts - but she was overdressed in comparison. <br> Alice ran over to Kedi and smiled into her grinning face and the beautiful erect nipples which seemed to suggest that Kedi was pleased to see her. She felt like instantly throwing herself on the ground and making love, but the most she could do was kiss her full on the face and breathlessly declare how pleased she was to see her. <br> Alice and Kedi walked back to Alice's flat, with Alice helping to carry Kedi's bags. When the two girls came by a little copse near home, passion got the better of Alice and she flung herself on Kedi. &quot;Here! Now!&quot; she gasped as a command. &quot;Now!&quot; Kedi nodded, and the two girls crept into the copse out of the public gaze. <br> When they'd got behind a bush, Alice pulled off her tee-shirt in one passionate gesture and forced down her shorts. She then pushed herself on top of Kedi who was overwhelmed by the attention. Alice put her whole mouth over Kedi's nipple and while biting and nibbling it, eagerly rubbed Kedi's vagina. Kedi reciprocated with just as much enthusiasm but with more practiced skill. <br> Anyone passing by would have heard the moaning and groaning as the two girls forgot everything and made love on the damp and dirty ground. Grit and trampled leaves affixed themselves to Alice's skin, but she didn't care. All she cared about was Kedi. <br> After Alice didn't know how long, the two girls were sated and with reluctance picked up their things to return to Alice's home, but Alice just couldn't find it in herself to put her clothes back on. It felt so wonderful to be skin against skin with the one she loved! Consequently, Alice and Kedi wandered back naked together through the tree-lined streets to the flat, unconcerned about the attention they attracted. What did Alice care for what other people felt: she was just happy to be arm in arm with Kedi, nestling up against her warm black body. <br> When they got back home, Alice brought Kedi straight to her bed and they resumed making love. In fact, they wouldn't stop. The only reason Alice ever found for leaving Kedi was to go to the toilet or to have something to eat and Kedi would follow her, invariably as close to her as she could. <br> Innocence and Mouse were also making love most of the time now, but Alice felt that with the onus of having to entertain Kedi she was excused from helping Mouse with her rehearsals for King Lear. Unfortunately, Alice soon found that she couldn't monopolise Kedi's attention, as Kedi offered her assistance quite willingly. Alice had never before felt so much jealousy as when she watched Innocence's penis thrust in and out of Kedi's vagina with Mouse eagerly plunging her tongue in Kedi's mouth. So, she argued, maybe it is for art, and maybe the part I'm rehearsing is redundant at this point, but must I watch this? <br> She wondered what Kedi thought of Innocence's rather strange body, but, as always, Kedi just accepted it as it was. &quot;Innocence is a beautiful girl,&quot; she commented, &quot;and she is especially endowed where girls are not usually endowed at all.&quot; She also loved it as Innocence thrust in and out of her. It was on these occasions that Alice only felt a lessening of her jealousy if she caught sight of Mouse, who was clearly very passionately in love with Innocence, watching the two of them together with that look of jealousy Alice so recognised from herself. <br> When Alice made love to Innocence now, it was almost all out of spite to Mouse who also loved making love to Kedi (especially when Kedi used some of the curious penis shaped roots she'd brought with her from her own country). She especially made sure of doing so when Mouse was watching and she made sure that she expressed as much passion as she could as Innocence's prick pushed deep and deeper still inside her. In all this she would try and involve Kedi: licking, kissing, masturbating her as Innocence thrust away and caressed the both of them.<br> In the evenings however, Alice kept Kedi to herself. Mouse can sleep with Innocence. Dinah can sleep with Chastity. But Alice must sleep with Kedi. And through the night she would come and come again with a passion that she was sure echoed throughout the flat, and if it woke her sister or her friends, what did it matter? It showed that Alice and Kedi were very much in love and inseparable. No love, Alice was sure, was greater than that she felt for Kedi and her beautiful black body. <br> Alice loved everything about Kedi's body. She loved its relative maturity. She loved the fact she was so black, so that when the girls' bodies intertwined in as many as four - and when Dinah and Chastity became interested six - people, Kedi's body was so much apart from the rest of the white and pink flesh. Alice loved Kedi's strong gleaming white teeth, whose grin filled a whole room and would instantly stricken Alice with a passionate and helpless longing. She loved Kedi's cunt which so enveloped her tongue, which lubricated so easily with her fingers and gave out such a rich hot and seductive smell. She loved Kedi's round breasts with the beautiful brown nipples. If she prayed, and Alice never prayed, she would have prayed that Kedi should never leave her.<br> Much as Alice enjoyed Innocence's company, she never felt so warmly towards Chastity. This didn't matter so much while Chastity and Dinah spent so much time together - after all they were much the same age and had very similar sexual appetites. What changed Alice's attitude towards Chastity was when she took Kedi away from her.<br> At first it seemed almost innocent. Chastity only made love with Kedi while in mixed company, and, perhaps in compensation, Alice would be embraced by more than one other girl at the time. However, as Alice viewed Kedi and Chastity making love through Mouse's pubic hair with her tongue slowly licking at the moist opening, Alice felt acute pain as she watched the two girls in what could only be true passion. Even the slow rhythmic thrust of Innocence's prick up her own cunt while supporting herself on Alice's raised buttocks couldn't distract her from her jealousy.<br> Mouse noticed Alice's unease, and tenderly lifted herself up, obscuring Alice's view of the black and white coupling, and stroked Alice's head. &quot;What's the matter?&quot; Mouse wondered. &quot;Don't we satisfy you?&quot;<br> Alice couldn't answer, but there came to her a sudden welling up of emotion as she thought of Kedi making love to Dinah. She took her mouth away from Mouse's cunt and looked longingly into Mouse's face. She felt terribly conscious of the salt track of tears down her cheeks - but she knew that any attempt to hold them back would merely cause her to cry loudly. She could hear not only Innocence's pants as she thrust vigorously away, but also the painfully loud and mutual gasps from Kedi and Chastity.<br> Any illusion Alice may have cherished that Kedi's and Chastity's affection was less than mutual were removed when with a rush of hot thick semen and a gasp Innocence had come inside her, and the cries of her lover and Chastity couldn't be in any way confused. If anything the loudest and fullest throated cries may have come from Kedi while Chastity voraciously chewed at her vagina.<br> It didn't really come as too much of a surprise when Alice found that she was sharing Kedi with Chastity, but the first night when Dinah returned to their bed and Kedi stayed in the same bed as Chastity still required severe mental readjustment. Dinah could see that Alice was troubled and did her best to comfort her. But making love with Dinah didn't work that evening. The thought of incest only reminded Alice of Innocence's sister and whom she was sleeping with.<br> Alice thought that maybe her selfless love could be resolved merely by being near Kedi - but the fact was that although she and Kedi would still make love it was less frequent than before and there was always the strong smell of Chastity about her. In fact, although their moments of passion satisfied Alice in a way that no one else could, she couldn't hide her misery and jealousy from Kedi.<br> &quot;But Alice dearest,&quot; Kedi tried to argue. &quot;It is no reflection on my love for you that I sleep with Chastity now.&quot;<br> &quot;But I love you,&quot; replied Alice. &quot;When I'm not with you I feel a void in my life. Only when we're together am I whole.&quot;<br> &quot;Don't be silly,&quot; Kedi tried to laugh, but she was visibly troubled by Alice's contention of love. Kedi however did suggest that she make love with Chastity. &quot;Perhaps you could get to love her as well.&quot;<br> &quot;But I only want you.&quot;<br> Alice had not once made love to Chastity, although Chastity had frequently felt and tongued Alice's body when all six girls were making love together. These sixsomes usually only happened by chance and not usually on Alice's volition. But sometimes when a couple became a threesome, it seemed only natural that the numbers should be added to. So perhaps Kedi, Innocence and Alice might be making love on the garden lawn as the evening sun drew in, only to be joined by Mouse - tempted as always by Innocence's penis that she would always want to have pushed into her mouth and feel the hot warmth of it against her lips and the back of her tongue down her throat. Then one of Dinah or Chastity would join in, excited by so much sexual activity, to be joined not much later by the other older girl.<br> It was in such circumstances as these that Alice would find herself having love made to her by Chastity, but not once just the two girls together. However, one night, Alice was lying in bed alone listening to the sounds of Mouse, Innocence and one other making love together - Mouse as always making the loudest moans. &quot;Innocence! Oo! Innocence! Ooo! Oooo!&quot; she gasped. She was masturbating desultorily to this, imagining Kedi's gorgeous black body against her's. Kedi's tongue in her cunt. Her fingers up her backside. A slim black bum stretched out in front of her on the mattress.<br> It was then that Alice became aware of another presence in the room, but it wasn't Kedi. And it wasn't Dinah either. Chastity was sitting perched, naked as always, at the end of her bed watching Alice's fingers stroke and finger her cunt. Seeing that Alice had spotted her, Chastity tenderly stretched out her arm and her fingers to anchor on Alice's knee, and to stroke it softly, softly. She gradually moved her hand from stroking the knee to the inner thigh and stroked it more sensually towards the upper end of the thigh near the crotch. Alice removed her own fingers from her cunt, and lay back in an almost helpless position as Chastity became bolder with her caresses.<br> Alice neither resisted nor encouraged Chastity in her love-making, as Chastity soon engaged her mouth on the still quite moist cunt and nibbled around the hairy flowering of it and the legs around it. After a while, Chastity could see that there was not going to be much more response, so she briefly kissed Alice on the left nipple and left her room.<br> A few minutes later, Dinah entered the room, quite clearly exhausted after her love-play with Innocence and Mouse. A trail of Innocence's thick semen trickled down between her legs, and would soon make a little damp patch on the sheets wherever Dinah should choose to sit.<br> &quot;You know,&quot; said Alice, almost as an aside, &quot;the apartment's got terribly crowded since Chastity and Innocence have been here.&quot;<br> Dinah started, as if this revelation had never occurred to her, but she looked at Alice thoughtfully. Clearly, she had had her own discussions with Kedi and Chastity on Alice's happiness. &quot;I suppose four people is about the most this apartment can handle for any length of time. Perhaps the two sisters would be happy to visit the countryside.&quot;<br> &quot;The countryside?&quot; wondered Alice.<br> &quot;Well, I know that Une's quite happy to entertain any of our friends,&quot; suggested Dinah.<br> &quot;Would they like that?&quot;<br> &quot;It would be absolutely perfect,&quot; Dinah said. And what is more, Alice thought, Kedi could stay here with me without Chastity's malevolent influence.</p> <p></p> <b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> </font></b><!-- #EndEditable --></td>
