                          <td colspan="2" width="100%"> <!-- #BeginEditable "story" --> <p>After Charlotte's discovery of the two girls together, Harriett and Emma no longer made even the slightest pretence that there was nothing between them. Charlotte became accustomed to finding the couple entwined around each other in the living room and elsewhere, and her sense of betrayal and frustration gradually receded in the face of a fact that couldn't now be changed. Charlotte tried to look away from their activities, but her eyes still strayed towards them, although there was nothing too overtly sexual in their behaviour. As long as they just cuddle, Charlotte said to herself, I can still dream. She gazed longingly at Emma, but she felt constrained from even kissing or hugging her. Contrarily, Emma was much more affectionate towards Charlotte ? stroking her hair, kissing her cheeks, patting her buttocks ? but never in a way that could be construed as a sexual invitation. <br> Emma was concerned that Harriett shouldn't lose sight of the original intention of their intimacy. &quot;Perhaps now,&quot; she suggested, &quot;we've practised enough and we should find out how you actually would perform in front of the camera.&quot; <br> &quot;But how would we do that?&quot; wondered Harriett from between Emma's legs, a few loose hairs in her teeth. <br> &quot;I've got a video recorder and we can ask Charlotte to film us,&quot; suggested Emma matter?of?factly. And indeed that's what they did next time they saw Charlotte just as she was returning from work. She was just pulling off her knickers ? always the last item she took off as to her it marked the moment she progressed from merely undressed to nude. It was not a welcome suggestion, but there was probably no favour that Emma could ask that Charlotte wouldn't perform. Even scorned in love, Charlotte reasoned, she could show how pure and unselfish her love was. She still hoped that Harriett was merely a phase in Emma's love life and that soon her true love would return to her, an altogether better candidate. <br> &quot;I've never used one before,&quot; Charlotte answered, hoping this could be the excuse to avoid the humiliation of filming the woman she loved making love to another woman. &quot;And certainly not for something like that.&quot; <br> &quot;Don't be silly,&quot; said Harriett. &quot;There's nothing to it. It's auto?focus. All you've got to do is point it in the right direction and make sure it's rolling.&quot; <br> &quot;Isn't there some art to it?&quot; wondered Charlotte. &quot;The right angles and so on.&quot; <br> &quot;We're not asking you to make an art film,&quot; Emma laughed. &quot;We just want to see what Harriett's like, so that when she makes love with a woman professionally it all goes well. No one's going to watch it except Harriett and me.&quot; <br> &quot;And anyway if you think the cameramen at work are making art, you're sadly mistaken,&quot; laughed Harriett. &quot;All they do is what we're asking you to do. Just film us making love and point the camera at the interesting bits.&quot; <br> &quot;The interesting bits?&quot; <br> &quot;Don't be so na&iuml;ve!&quot; Emma exclaimed amusedly, leaning over and kissing Charlotte on the mouth. &quot;I'm sure you'll have no difficulty in working out which they are.&quot; <br> Emma and Harriett spent about an hour together in the bathroom to prepare for the filming, mostly soaping themselves in the shower and ensuring that their bodies were clean and their pubic hairs shining. Emma was fascinated to find that even Harriett, with her athletic slim body felt she needed more than just soap to look her best as she adorned make?up over her nipples and around her crotch. &quot;It actually looks more natural on a video,&quot; she explained, but Emma wasn't persuaded. Her principles of naturism were too strict to permit using such artifice. She did consent however to Harriett sucking and pulling on her nipples to ensure that they were quite erect to start with. <br> Charlotte practised , in the meantime, by filming around the living room and then playing the results back on the video player. It was very easy: technology had certainly come a long way. You just pointed the video recorder at something ? say a chair ? and it remained in focus as you moved towards it or away from it. Even in darkened parts of the room the recorder automatically widened its aperture to ensure that enough light entered the lens. <br> &quot;Are you ready?&quot; wondered Emma coming out of the bathroom with a blow?dried crotch and a radiant expression. Charlotte couldn't help noticing how very stiff Emma's nipples were: they were normally pert but not that pert. <br> Harriett suggested her own bedroom because her bed was the widest and there was better lighting. &quot;And that's where I'm most relaxed anyway,&quot; Emma laughed. Charlotte was not amused. <br> At first the exercise was very clumsy. It was very difficult for Emma to proceed knowing that Charlotte was filming her every move. She kept catching glimpses of the video recorder as it panned around her crotch and her breasts. Charlotte herself was thinking more of her own humiliation in filming the woman she loved doing the things she wanted to do, and finding it difficult to keep her mind on the object of the exercise. However, the more experienced Harriett took everything in command. She kept half an eye on the camera and Charlotte and occasionally made signs to Charlotte as to where to point the camera. Emma appreciated how Harriett also took command of her love?making. Emma admired Harriett's professionalism as she guided Emma's mouth down to her vagina while stroking Emma's back and gesturing Charlotte to film Emma's frantic tongue. The skill was not only that of being able to make love unselfconsciously in front of other people, but of also maximising the activities for their erotic televisual potential. <br> Charlotte was able to think as she filmed that perhaps this was not really Emma she was filming, but just a sex star on the sex videos Emma was bringing into the flat. Was it real sex? she wondered. She'd sometimes wondered that when watching these videos. However, as Emma relaxed more and became more excited by the eroticism of the occasion, it became evident to Charlotte that this was real sex. Emma emitted gasps and grunts that increased in frequency and were reciprocated by Harriett. &quot;Oh God! Oh God!&quot; she yelled from a sudden orgasmic shudder. Charlotte was taken aback, but she was herself aroused by Emma's arousal. Her thoughts focused on Emma and almost forgot that it was Harriett who was orchestrating the pleasure and whose tongue and teeth were working around Emma's vagina. <br> Almost unconsciously, while holding the video camera in her right hand her left hand wandered down to her own clitoris which she stroked to the same rhythm of Emma's orgasmic shudders. She found that her own vagina was moist. Oh! if only it was me that was giving Emma this pleasure she sighed. <br> All too soon for Emma whose body glistened with perspiration, they were finished, and the lovers lay on their backs in exhaustion. Charlotte was still filming, but on Harriett's prompting she had receded so that she could film the two girls together. <br> &quot;I wonder what it looks like,&quot; wondered Harriett signalling that Charlotte should now stop filming. As the company soon found out, it didn't have the gloss or sparkle associated with most television sex, and the video was peculiarly story?less, being just Harriett and Emma groping together. It was almost an emetic experience for Charlotte to see the two girls together again just as she had seen them earlier through the camera lens. <br> &quot;What do you think of our performance?&quot; Emma asked Charlotte kindly as the action showed Emma's finger working in and out of Harriet's anus. <br> &quot;I don't think I know what to say,&quot; said Charlotte truthfully. <br> &quot;I still need practice,&quot; Harriett stated forcefully. &quot;There's quite a few things I'm just not happy about. Not,&quot; she added, smiling at Emma, &quot;in terms of your performance, but my own. I think we'll have to repeat the exercise again.&quot; <br> Charlotte sighed inaudibly. She knew what Harriett's statement meant for her. However, she watched the rest of the video with the two lovers. After a while both Emma and Harriett were stroking and rubbing their vaginas ? and remembering her own excitement while filming Charlotte did the same thing. But she wasn't arousing herself at all. She was wondering if she could bear to stay and watch the rest of the video, when she heard a sharp gasp. <br> Was it that part of the video already? wondered Charlotte watching again as Harriett's mouth worked around Emma's breasts which was held up in offering. No, it wasn't ? she was sure ? the video hadn't even got to the bit when Harriett had put almost all of her tongue into Emma's vagina. She turned her head to look at Emma and Harriett, and saw that they had started making love to each other again. <br> Charlotte was then in a dilemma, which she could not reconcile. For the rest of the space of the video she had the choice of watching Emma and Harriett making love in the flesh or review them again on video. Eventually, she decided that the only thing she could was leave. She went to her own bedroom and slumped on her bed. Away from Emma and Harriett she was now able to imagine herself making love to Emma and that she was the recipient of Emma's affection. And in this way she furiously masturbated herself and was eventually sufficiently exhausted to get to sleep and not reflect too much on her loss. <br> Although Emma was becoming quite expert in making love, she could almost be considered to be a virgin ? she had only once ever had full penetration sex and that was not a particularly enjoyable experience. In fact it had so upset Emma that she had lost interest in making love altogether: but as a result of her experiments with Harriett she felt sure that the time had come when she could lose her virginity in a more meaningful way. <br> Charlotte really didn't see this as a shortcoming in Emma's sex life, indeed she had become rather used to seeing all the variations of it either through the camera lens or otherwise. Indeed, Emma and Harriett seemed to be making love all the time now. Whereas the two girls had previously been a little discreet, they now showed no compunction in cunnilingus or mutual masturbation or other such sexual activities when Charlotte was around. And Harriett continued to insist that Charlotte film the two girls together: an activity which was getting more polished. The videos Charlotte was filming now were still technically poor and had no story content, but Emma had lost her initial shyness and had learnt techniques from Harriett which made her performance much more interesting to watch. Charlotte concentrated more on the technical aspects of filming, and Harriett no longer needed to indicate what views to take. <br> Charlotte was in fact watching one of these videos when Emma mentioned her desire to lose her virginity. Emma and Harriett were still glistening with sweat after the sex in which they had just been indulging and a very strong post?orgasmic smell emanated from them. &quot;But it's got to be done properly...&quot; she announced. <br> &quot;Do you mean,&quot; wondered Charlotte, &quot;that you want it filmed?&quot; <br> &quot;What an interesting idea,&quot; commented Harriett. <br> &quot;No,&quot; decided Emma. &quot;I just mean it's got to be right. You know, it's an important thing and I want it to be something I'll remember with joy.&quot; <br> Charlotte's own first experience with sex hadn't really been that satisfactory either, so she appreciated what Emma was saying. But then, when you're a teenager, boys do tend to be unsubtle and clumsy. &quot;What do you mean properly?. Do you mean we invite a boy round to fuck you?&quot; <br> &quot;God no!&quot; said Emma with horror. &quot;I could only do it with Harriett.&quot; Charlotte inwardly sighed. &quot;No. I mean Harriett would have to wear one of those artificial penises, - dildos. I'm sure it'd be fine that way. I don't want to be impregnated by some disgusting man. And anyway the mere thought of a man sticking his thing in me is enough to make me feel unwell.&quot; <br> &quot;But why tell me?&quot; wondered Charlotte, who often wished that Emma wasn't so open about her sexual relationship. Naturism at home was one thing, she reasoned although there was always some sexual teasing in that. But watching the two girls having sex together day and night was entirely different. Charlotte was very nostalgic for the earlier days when only she and Emma wore no clothes. <br> &quot;Because, sweetest,&quot; said Emma with a very warm smile, &quot;whatever Harriett is, you are my best friend. I need you to be there. It's very important to me.&quot; She pulled Charlotte's warm naked body to her own still slightly damp one and hugged her more tightly than she had ever done before. She showered kisses all over Charlotte's face. &quot;Please say you will,&quot; she pleaded. <br> Charlotte was taken aback by the affection. &quot;But what am I to do?&quot; she gasped, hoping perhaps that she might still have a sexual role to play. But no, all Emma wanted her to do was to hold her hand. <br> Emma and Harriett arranged the day on which Emma would lose her virginity with some care. Harriett went out to choose a dildo with Charlotte from a shop that sold such things. Charlotte felt uneasy with Harriett these days, but Harriett was very good at reassuring her. She explained how much she treasured her relationship with Emma and how grateful she was for her affection. &quot;She loves you too,&quot; she confided to Charlotte, &quot;but she cherishes her friendship with you too much.&quot; <br> Harriett seemed like a different woman to Charlotte when she was not at home and undressed. She wore shorts and sweater just as she used to: looking much more like a sportswoman than a television sex performer. Charlotte now knew all about Harriett's body and envied her for its athletic trim. The two girls studied the different dildos in the shop. There seemed to be a much wider selection of dimensions and designs than Charlotte had ever expected. <br> &quot;I imagine Emma will want one that looks as natural as possible,&quot; commented Harriett picking one up and holding it to Charlotte's face. &quot;This is about standard size, isn't it?&quot; <br> It was actually significantly larger than the penises Charlotte generally saw, but she was aware that Harriett would always be meeting better endowed men in her trade than would the average woman. Harriett eased down her shorts and strapped the dildo on over her knickers. &quot;What do you think?&quot; she wondered, spinning round with the dildo looking almost like the real thing. <br> &quot;I'm sure it'll do the job,&quot; commented Charlotte, and indeed it was the one chosen. <br> The day came and the three girls arranged themselves in Emma's room (which was not the usual place for making love). Emma lay on her back and supported her head and shoulders in Charlotte's lap. Charlotte supported her shoulders and felt a warm sexual tingle as she felt Emma's naked skin on her crotch and thighs. Oh! if only it was me and not Harriett, she said to herself, as Harriett, dildo strapped around her otherwise naked body, lubricated Emma's vagina with her tongue and fingers. <br> Harriett spent what seemed to Charlotte from her experience of men an unusually long time stimulating Emma, occasionally stopping to look up at Emma to gauge her expression. Emma looked lovingly down at Harriett and sometimes gazed up at Charlotte. Charlotte could see that Emma was a little nervous so she gave as reassuring a smile as she could. <br> Eventually, Harriett assessed that Emma was ready. She seemed more than ready to Charlotte who felt the shuddering in Emma's shoulders and the whiplash of her hair as it was thrown about in ecstasy. Harriett eased the dildo into Emma's cunt and the reaction was almost immediate. &quot;Ohhh! Godd! Go?o?oddd! Uuooaahh!&quot; cried out Emma, shaking herself ecstatically. She grasped Charlotte's hand and squeezed it as if her life depended on it while gasping out. Then she screamed out in an aural ejaculation that frightened Charlotte. <br> Emma held tightly onto Harriett who rhythmically and rather slowly thrust her crotch back and forth. Charlotte eased herself back as she was worried about getting hit by Emma's frantically energetic body. She watched as the two girls rolled around as close together as they could joined by a phallic length of plastic. She noticed that Harriett gradually sped up the thrusting, and Emma's response became faster and more urgent. She's playing Emma's body like a musical instrument, thought Charlotte. And then she thought that Harriett was doing very well considering, as she had told her when they were choosing the dildo, that this was the first time for her as well in this role. <br> Eventually, and not a moment too soon for Charlotte who was frankly rather bored, the two girls finished and Harriett eased the dildo out from Emma's vagina. <br> &quot;You're not a virgin anymore,&quot; commented Charlotte dryly. <br> Emma gazed at Charlotte through the damp hair plastered to her sweaty forehead. Hers was the sweetest face Charlotte had ever seen, and quite suddenly Charlotte's heart broke. She burst into silent tears in the aura of Emma's post?orgasmic ecstasy and satisfaction. Emma smiled and let Charlotte take her body and stroke it with a freedom that had never been allowed before. She even managed to stroke Emma's pubic hairs, but Emma guarded her clitoris from her attention. Harriett also lay back exhausted. It was difficult for Charlotte to assess what Harriett's pleasure had been, but there was a smile on her face. <br> &quot;You were wonderful!&quot; suddenly exclaimed Emma falling on top of Harriett and kissing her again. She wept from passionate love for Harriett. Charlotte felt very embarrassed, but it didn't surprise her at all when Emma and Harriett recommenced their love?making. Charlotte silently detached herself from their company and settled in her bed where she tried to sleep as best she could with the thumping and screaming emanating all night from Emma's bed. <br> Charlotte was quite pleased when Emma told her that she and Harriett were entertaining a friend for a meal, even though it would mean that true to her natural modesty she would wear clothes that evening. (Not a concession that would ever occur to Emma). The main source of pleasure was that perhaps for one night Charlotte wouldn't be confronted by the naked bodies of her flatmates writhing about the living?room floor. This pleasure, however, was replaced by some apprehension when Harriett explained that the young lady, Josephine, was actually the woman who had been successfully auditioned for the role of making love to Harriett on television, but a little relieved when Harriett explained that she'd never made love to a woman before either. <br> Her apprehension seemed totally unfounded when Josephine arrived. She was a tall quite slender woman in a quite constricting white dress and had her long hair tied up and off her face. Her face was pale and she had blue cheeks underneath slightly startled eyes. When she smiled she emanated an air of sweet innocence which seemed almost inappropriate for someone in her industry, but as she explained it was a thespian rather than a pornographic career that she really aspired to. <br> The four girls sat round the table for a meal cooked jointly by Emma and Harriett and listened as Josephine discussed her stage performances in repertory and about the difficulties of finding work for an actress even in the big city. Unusually, everyone but Emma was dressed and looking, Charlotte thought, just like most groups of girls gathered for a meal together should look. Indeed, Charlotte found the thought of Emma wearing clothes as so alien that her nudity seemed far more natural than it might otherwise be. <br> After the meal, Emma and Charlotte retreated into the kitchen to wash up the dishes and Harriett remained with Josephine. Harriett was explaining to Josephine how she and Emma had practised making love together and how, to improve their technique, they had encouraged Charlotte to film them together. The conversation was of such a matter?of?fact tone that Charlotte wasn't in the slightest bit alarmed. And anyway she had news that she had been dying all day to impart to Emma and now was the ideal time. <br> &quot;I've got the transfer I've been applying for,&quot; she announced to Emma. <br> &quot;Oh how wonderful!&quot; said Emma giving Charlotte a kiss while wiping the inside of a glass with the tea?towel. &quot;Where to?&quot; <br> &quot;To this naturist branch in the Civil Service,&quot; Charlotte announced, her sleeves rolled up and soap?suds to her wrists. <br> &quot;'Naturist' branch?&quot; wondered Emma who'd never heard of such a thing before. <br> &quot;Yes,&quot; smiled Charlotte triumphantly, &quot;Some branches ? especially unpopular ones like tax, social security and so on ? attract staff by having a naturist policy. That means that staff have the freedom to wear as few clothes as possible while at work. So now I can work in as few clothes as I wear at home!&quot; <br> &quot;That's absolutely marvellous!&quot; exclaimed Emma grabbing Charlotte round the waist and showering her face with kisses. &quot;Absolutely wonderful! I'm so happy for you.&quot; <br> Charlotte was delighted with Emma's response. She had been trying for so long to get this transfer as she had felt so inferior compared to Emma who could wear nothing at work all day and nobody would think it the oddest thing at all, while she had to wear smart clothe. Now, she felt, she could be a real naturist and, perhaps, get the respect from Emma that she felt was lacking. <br> When Charlotte and Emma came back into the living room, laughing and giggling, they found Josephine and Harriett sitting in front of the video watching one of the videos Charlotte had filmed of Harriett and Emma making love. Harriett was explaining in technical terms some of the sexual techniques involved in the performance. To Charlotte's ears, it sounded more like someone explaining golfing techniques rather than how to make love. Alarmingly for Charlotte, she found that both Harriett and Josephine were wearing just underwear, which in Josephine's case meant a white silk slip and knickers and in Harriett's case nothing but black knickers. Not quite nudity, thought Charlotte. <br> All that was to change however, as Harriett explained to Emma that Josephine had watched the videos that Charlotte had filmed and had felt very nervous about her own lack of sexual experience with other women. Consequently, they had agreed that it was better for her to practice with Emma and Harriett. They had been waiting for Emma to return from the kitchen to ask her if she wouldn't mind participating in some instruction. <br> At first Emma seemed hesitant, but she looked at Josephine's rather shy face and the slender body underneath the slip and relented. &quot;We'd better take all our clothes off then&quot; she announced. <br> At this prompting Harriett pulled her knickers down to reveal her little triangular bush of hair, and, somewhat less enthusiastically, Josephine removed her slip to reveal smallish round breasts with pert pink nipples and a very tidy patch of pubic hair. She looked at Charlotte pleadingly. &quot;Are you joining in?&quot; she asked. <br> &quot;Charlotte doesn't do this sort of thing!&quot; announced Emma, which to Charlotte's ears sounded very presumptuous, but she didn't feel like arguing at this juncture. Indeed what she did do, as the girls settled down in a cross?legged triangle on the well?worn rug in front of the gas fire, was discreetly retreat to her room without another word.<br> As soon as her door was shut, Charlotte pulled off her clothes. &quot;That's the last time I'll ever wear clothes!&quot; she announced to herself with a kind of determination, knowing full well that it was unlikely that she'd ever be able to stay true to her own word. She examined her naked reflection in the mirror. What was wrong with her? she wondered. She was sure she wasn't unattractive. She was of a less slender frame than Emma and a less athletic trim than Harriett, but she had an attractive body nonetheless. She slowly masturbated herself trying to excite herself with thoughts of making love, but she somehow couldn't get any excitement. <br> &quot;What the hell!&quot; she announced loudly, standing up and walking out of her room still naked. Perhaps with Josephine there she would have that opportunity to show her sexual self that had been so much denied, she thought. She pushed open the door to the living?room as quietly as she could. What she saw was a writhing mass of three bodies all intent on stimulating each others' bodies. Only the odd glimpse of a face and Charlotte's familiarity with Emma's and Harriett's bodies could distinguish one body from another. She stood by the door for several minutes feeling like a trespasser in her own house in the midst of the gasps and pants of sexual excitement. <br> Josephine was clearly not as experienced in lesbian love as the other two girls, but that, if anything, only made her the more attractive in Charlotte's eyes. Indeed, Charlotte was beginning to feel that same melting?away feeling she very often felt in Emma's company. As she watched Josephine, she caught a glimpse of her espying her and for a moment she froze, enduring her gaze. She flushed, feeling suddenly embarrassed for being there naked, neither joining in nor being apart but being merely a voyeuse. <br> And then she ran off to her bedroom and, although it was earlier than her usual bed?time, she went straight to bed. She was able to masturbate now, and she did so furiously until she went to sleep, but the image uppermost in her mind was the vision of Emma and Josephine locked in passionate embrace. </p> <b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> </font></b><!-- #EndEditable --></td>
