        <p>By Starlight<br>
          Part I </p>
        <p>Dear Memory,<br>
          Why should I arrange to meet you? You are a distant, shameful figure 
          from my past, my reckless youth. Why should I agree to meet with you? 
          Deceive my husband, my family? My marriage may not be a hotbed of passion, 
          but by our culture's standards, he has been a good husband. I am a respectable 
          married woman. And yet... thinking of you awakens that wicked, wilful 
          girl of my youth and that wild and passionate summer of love. There 
          was pleasure in my wickedness, a passion that my life has lacked ever 
          since you first tempted me from the path of innocence and purity. Attending 
          that party was a treat from grateful parents. My mock exam results had 
          been good, and the summer holidays involved many relaxing of strict 
          rules, and the freedom to mix with girls, western girls of my own age. 
          I had pleaded to be allowed to attend Carol Waterman's party. The assurance 
          of her parent's oversight had let them give me the freedom to remain 
          until midnight. That night I met you&#133; something that my life had 
          not prepared me for. Attentive, witty and with a sharp intelligence 
          that allowed me to open my inner self to you, in a way that I have never 
          found since. You had that funny, lopsided smile, which wormed its way 
          into my heart. I trusted you. I think with was the respect that you 
          paid me, no pushing, no cajoling. I knew that there were at least two 
          other girls at that party who seemed annoyed that you appeared to prefer 
          my company. You talked of things that made my blood heat, my head spin. 
          Was the fruit punch spiked? I knew about sex, the theory, and read romantic 
          fiction that would have horrified my mother. I was curious, I was nervous 
          of you&#133; and it was a wonderful feeling. Adrenalin is a potent drug. 
          You kissed me, open mouthed and with a passion that had my heart beating 
          wildly in my heaving chest. I turned you on, and was delighted and amazed 
          at the power I discovered I possessed&#133; You touched me, caressing 
          the swell of my breasts and I murmured a 'no'. And you stopped. You 
          apologised and you made me feel very safe, very much in control. I took 
          your hand, your tanned masculine hand and placed it over my breast. 
          That first kiss, first touch ignited fires that I never knew lay dormant 
          within me. I knew how terrible, in the eyes of my family, my actions 
          were&#133; and enjoyed each and every second of my tiny rebellion. If 
          it hadn't been to terrible, so intoxicating, it may not have gone any 
          further.</p>
        <p>We ended up out on the veranda, the security light leaving a corner 
          of deep shadow. I wore a long skirt, as fitting for a modest Indian 
          girl, but it also possessed a thigh high side slit. You hand found it 
          unerringly, and I stood shivering with your warm, firm had roaming over 
          my bare skin. You advanced, and paused, advanced a little more, as if 
          waiting on my reaction. We both knew were you were going&#133; and like 
          you, I had no idea if you would reach your goal. The first brush of 
          you knuckles against the front of my panties had me swooning in your 
          arms. My knees threatened to give way. You remained considerate, when 
          you could easily have forged ahead taking full advantage of my overwhelmed 
          senses. Instead, you maintained the gentle contact and asked if I was 
          ok. My response, if memory serves, was 'that I had never known that 
          I could feel so good'. You quickly proved how much better it was possible 
          to feel.<br>
          Your stroking finger soon had my honey flowing freely, the material 
          of my knickers seemed to magnify the sensations, as you smoothed it 
          into the groove of my sex. Then you blew what remained of my resolve, 
          a finger slipping past the edge of my gusset, and into the hot, sticky 
          depths of my vagina. The sensations were so intense - I stopped you 
          then, not because I disliked what you were doing, but more from fright 
          at my own reaction. I was sure I was going to collapse, my legs no longer 
          able to support me, a scream in my throat choked back with difficulty. 
          You held me tightly, letting me recover my composure. So began my summer 
          of love.</p>
        <p>You fingered me again that night, in the half hour before my parents 
          were due to pick me up. We walked down the drive to the gate, hand in 
          hand, like lovers in one of my forbidden books. You stood behind me, 
          arms around my waste, nuzzling the nape of my neck, nibbling at my ears. 
          To my shame... to my pride, I took your hand and pressed it between 
          my thighs. I wanted more of what you had given me my first taste of. 
          You needed no second invitation, your hand quickly sliding down the 
          waistband of my skirt, and down the front of my pants. You held my sex, 
          my pubic mound in the palm of your hand with a delicately and reverence 
          that I found overwhelming. I closed my eyes and lay back against the 
          support of your body and let it happen, your free hand caressing my 
          breast, the fingers of the other&#133; parting the lips of my pussy, 
          rubbing knowingly at the swollen nub of my clitoris, curling to probe 
          the sticky opening beneath. I stood it for as long as I could, before 
          the sensations threatened to overwhelm me again. Each time your fingers 
          penetrated me, my buttocks pressed backwards against you... and the 
          hardness in your groin. Your manhood, your penis. I savoured the words, 
          to my shame. Erect, hard - in preparation to do what your fingers were 
          doing to me. Frightening. Wicked. Exiting. That knowledge turned my 
          knees to jelly.<br>
          At the approach of headlights you stepped off the drive and into the 
          bushes. My parents found me standing demure and alone, not even the 
          taint of alcohol on me. </p>
        <p>I talked my parents in letting me start going to the boat club, it 
          was the daily social centre, around the swimming pool. Carol Waterman 
          was my key, and her parents would pick me up and bring me home. It became 
          an everyday occurrence, to sunbathe and swim the day away. I loved you 
          in your swimming trunks, broad shouldered, tanned and we flirted all 
          that first day in the water. I wanted to kiss you... have you kiss me. 
          Any lingering embarrassment from the previous night was dispelled by 
          your obvious delight in me. I hungered for the bikini swimsuits the 
          western girls sported, and hated the one-piece black Speedo my parents 
          insisted on. I loved you lack of concern, and the sincerity when you 
          told me that you where with me, and not them. I almost thought that 
          the day was would pass uneventfully, and then you asked me if I wanted 
          to explore. I almost wet myself there and then in my eagerness.</p>
        <p>Behind the changing block was an enclosed leafy glade, well screened 
          from all eyes. You kissed me, and with not a drop of fruit punch in 
          sight. I loved your strong arms around me, your lips on mine. In a fit 
          of bravery, and blunt honesty, I confess that I had &quot;diddled&quot; 
          myself to sleep last night... several times. You held me tightly, our 
          bodies pressed together, your arousal pressed hard against my stomach. 
          Remembering the pleasure you had given my last night, I turned around 
          inside the circle of your arms, and press my bottom against you, placing 
          your hand once more between my thighs. The material was stretchable 
          enough to allow you to slide your hand inside the high cut leg and once 
          again I quivered on your fingertips. You pressed the boundaries further 
          this time, working my breast free from their confinement. My nipples 
          had never been so hard, or so sensitive. In the warm afternoon sunshine, 
          yards from a crowd, I was having my bare breast fondled while your fingers 
          worked their magic with my pussy. It was so bad&#133;. It was so wonderful. 
          I groped behind my body, and fumbled at your trunks. I wasn't thinking, 
          I was reacting to my body's demands. I had a stab of fear, of nervous 
          anticipation, as I found the drawstring of your trunks. Your penis, 
          your cock. A hard warm bar of flesh. Despite the pleasurable distraction 
          of your fingers, the urge to take full advantage of my compulsion made 
          me turn towards you, and examine my catch. I was focused on you, tugging 
          you free from the swimming trunks. This was no curly little tail that 
          the only images I seen depicted.. this was a throbbing bar of veined 
          manhood, blood warm and alive in my hand. I was mesmerised, ignoring 
          your frozen immobility, and knelt unconsciously to take in the details. 
          The pale, blue veined column rising from the dark bush of reddish brown 
          pubic hair, the dark plum like head, the glans. I was fascinated by 
          the loose movement of the outer skin. It was not until some days later, 
          when you explained about foreskins, that I would know that I held a 
          circumcised model. Call me biased, but I have always had a preference 
          for them. <br>
          I never told you then, but when I leaned closer, eye to eye so to speak, 
          my open mouth was nothing more than slack jawed awe. When you leaned 
          forward and pressed the blunt head of your cock to my lips, it certainly 
          surprised me. But with an instinct that I did not know I possessed, 
          I knew what you wanted&#133; and swayed forward to accept you. Your 
          cock filled my mouth, my lips stretched wide to accept its girth. I 
          dimly heard your groan and could feel the trembling in your body. I 
          had never suspected that such a sexual act existed... none of my romantic 
          reading had covered this kind of detail. I felt cheated! I did little, 
          I heard you wince and felt your body flinch when my teeth snagged the 
          flared base of your glans, and struggled to keep my lips shielding you. 
          I snuffled through my nose, and vainly tried to swallow the saliva the 
          slightly salty taste of you generated. You slid back and forth - restrained, 
          shallow thrusts - once moving my hand to a firmer grip around the flared 
          base of your shaft, so that I was masturbating, wanking you in time 
          with your fast, short thrusting. <br>
          You fucked my willing mouth in a steadily increasing tempo, and just 
          as I became aware of more aromatic salty tang, you pulled wetly back, 
          leaving me gasping like a landed fish. I could feel the shudder in your 
          body, felt the jerk and pulse in your shaft and saw the little eye flare 
          as the first jet of semen spat out of you, hitting my chin and cheek, 
          before you crouched and pulled me close. I rose to meet you, and your 
          slippery, spurting cock was pressed to my breasts, and I felt the subsequent 
          lesser spurts against my throat and between my breasts. As your tremors 
          subsided, and your climax passed, I found myself wanting to cry. Cry? 
          In joy, in awe&#133; in burst of passion, or the power of love? Let 
          us settle for an excess of emotion. <br>
          Then, as considerate as ever, you knelt and kissed me, my slimy breast 
          pressed to your broad chest. You fingered me some more, this time down 
          the inside the low cut back of my swimsuit, down between the cheeks 
          of my bottom and in from behind. I would come to know love that rear 
          entry method in the days to come.</p>
        <p>My diary records that as the first of twenty-three blowjobs I gave 
          you that summer. I held you to me the second time, and swallowed your 
          cum. I drank your seed eighteen times, the remaining times I held your 
          jerking cock between my breasts drinking you through my skin. Young 
          girls and the diaries.<br>
          I sucked your cock in your bedroom, in my parent's bathroom, in the 
          bushes at the boat club and in our respective garden. I drank you cum 
          in the darkened back row of the cinema, and once on the back seat of 
          a taxi. I even risked death by drowning to take you in my mouth underwater 
          in the swimming pool one memorable afternoon. I became rather good at 
          sucking cock, blowjobs, giving head. I struggled to perfect my technique 
          and leaned to breath with a mouthful of cock, and even practiced the 
          skill of deep-throating you. I came to love the taste of you, and even 
          today, I expect to taste the tang of swimming pool chlorine..<br>
          The pleasure giving was not one sided. Another party, and we quickly 
          sneaked off into the garden and found a secluded spot amongst some guava 
          trees. The grass was rough and scratchy, and the fear of insects made 
          me unwilling to lie down. I knelt on your jacket and with now practised 
          hand unzipped and unbelted his jeans, pulling them and your underpants 
          down to your knees. You were a little reluctant to be so exposed, but 
          I could not get enough of your cock. Your testicals, your balls fascinated 
          me anew... and I loved to hold your firm muscular behind tight against 
          me when you came in my mouth. I was getting good at sucking cock, and 
          was able to press you right to the back of my throat without gagging, 
          for a short period at least. I learned to lick the underside of your 
          cock, making you writhe and moan in pleasure. And I had learned to make 
          you cum, my masturbating your shaft and bobbing mouth in an irresistible 
          combination - half a dozen strokes in the right combination and you 
          filled my mouth with semen. As always, you knelt and kissed my open 
          mouth, and I never knew until I had experience more of life how distasteful 
          most men found kissing a mouth so recently ejaculated into. This night 
          you bade me stand, and once I did you skinned my damp knickers down 
          to my ankles, and a little uncertainly I stepped out of them. Then you 
          shoved your face into my lap and licked my pouting slit. Oh god. You 
          drove me wild, with tongue and fingers and hot panting breath. I locked 
          my fingers in your fashionably long hair and ground myself against your 
          face, your nose, your mouth. You sucked my clit, and tongued my vagina 
          in a veritable waterfall of honey. I came, noisy, grunting like an animal, 
          struggling not to collapse in a quivering loose-legged heap. You ate 
          me until I begged you to stop, tugging at your hair. You could have 
          fucked me then&#133; I almost begged you to. I was fully aware, in spite 
          of my recent blowjob, that you cock was hard... and only inches from 
          my pussy... my cunt. Along with other parts of my anatomy, you certainly 
          expanded my vocabulary. A dirty word, unloved by women around the world... 
          but descriptive, earthy and crude. I was a dirty, wicked girl, with 
          hot wet cunt, that wanted to be stuffed full of cock. This time your 
          kiss was full of the flavour of me. The tangy, musky flavour of my flowing 
          honey, and it mixed nicely with the lingering flavour of you semen. 
          A portent of things to come.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I spent the next two days wrestling with my conscience. Everything 
          up until know could be dismissed as minor, not true, but it could come 
          under the heading of messing around or heavy petting. What I now desired, 
          craved, was beyond those bounds by a long, long way. Shame, dishonour... 
          my parent's reaction could not be imagined, so terrible would be the 
          wrath that would descend upon me. Which only made my desire worse&#133; 
          I wanted to kick over the traces, my wild streak had been given a freedom 
          I had never dreamed existed. I was a wicked, wanton whore and I revelled 
          in my secret life. I knew that what we were doing could come to a dramatic, 
          painful conclusion at any moment. Our time together, our summer of love 
          was finite. And I knew that you had to be my first. </p>
        <p><br>
          The next night my parents planned an evening out, I let you know that 
          we would be free until at least ten that night. You were outside my 
          door at eight. <br>
          I said nothing to you about my decision. But you knew I think. You said 
          nothing as I led you by the hand into my bedroom. I felt strangely shy 
          as you looked around my girly room and the lacy d&eacute;cor. I had 
          stripped the bed down to a single sheet, and your eyes widened with 
          understanding, confirmation? I undressed you... stilling your attempts 
          to aid me. Then you stood naked before me, your cock a ridged vertical 
          bar of male arousal. I told you to stand immobile as I slipped my blouse 
          off, removed my bra and then suddenly rather self consciously, my knickers. 
          A dramatic pause and I let my skirt fall around my ankles. I remember 
          how wide your eyes were, soaking up my totally naked body for the first 
          time. You lay on the bed, as I requested, before I knelt between you 
          thighs. I gave you a long, slow drawn out blowjob. Every time you moved 
          to participate, I hushed you. 'Later'. Your hardness throbbed and jerked, 
          filled me, and I swallowed, savouring every drop. Rather reluctantly, 
          I let you slide free of my mouth. The moment had moved a stage closer. 
          I smiled up at your flushed features, and whispered, 'Your turn'.<br>
          On my back, my thighs unceremoniously spread wide, knees raised in the 
          classic, eternal position for the receiving of cock, for the first time 
          ever. I had never been so exposed, so vulnerable in my life. And I trusted 
          you&#133; as few have been trusted since. I knew, deep inside myself, 
          that you found me desirable, your transparent fascination with my body, 
          my cunt, warmed my heart and soul. You licked my slit, with you magical 
          tongue, parting the swollen labial lips with your fingers. You licked 
          and probed every fold and crevice, from my throbbing clit to my honey 
          filled vaginal opening. My hips bucked up and I came explosively, a 
          few moments later I grunted and moaned in the throes of another. It 
          was becoming unbearable - I tugged hard at your hair, and made you yelp, 
          pulling you up. You rose to your knees, panting, eyes glazed. Your hard, 
          still wet, manhood bobbed in front of you sweaty body. I was tempted 
          to say 'Make love to me'&#133; but I was feeling wicked and dirty, the 
          words came out as 'Fuck me. Fill me. Make me cum'.<br>
          Thank you for your hesitation, you enquiring look of 'Are you sure?'. 
          Oh Dear Memory, I have rarely been more sure of anything in my life 
          - and mouthed a silent plea of 'Yes'. One swift motion and the blunt 
          wedge of your cock was pressing against my honey dripping opening. One 
          long, firm push and I was full to the brim with throbbing manhood. No 
          pain, none of the discomfort I had feared. Instead there was fulfilment, 
          intense satisfaction and a warmth deep inside me that I have never experienced 
          since&#133;<br>
          I writhed under you, enjoying the sweaty weight of your body, your hardness 
          soaking in my hot clinging depths You lay, trembling slightly, the slow 
          steady throb of your cock, as you kissed my face, my mouth, my aching 
          breasts. We lay for several lifetimes, and you seemed to be savouring 
          the sensation as much as I. Drawing out that special moment, that first 
          ever, full length penetration of my womanhood. If for nothing else, 
          I owe you that memory, that special, once in a lifetime moment. I could 
          feel every twitch and pulse of you, the mouth of my cunt so highly sensitive 
          that I could detect the minuet motions caused by our respective breathing.</p>
        <p>Then you fucked my brains out. Starting slowly, easing the hard length 
          of throbbing cock back and forth in my over lubricated cunt, my knees 
          spreading ever wider to allow you fill me deeper, harder. Speeding up 
          slowly, the strange sensation I suddenly realised was your testicals, 
          your balls swinging against the swollen, sensitive bud of my anus. Your 
          hands, sliding under my buttocks, lifting me, moist fingertips at my 
          anus. Many of your early exploratory fingering of my body led to that 
          forbidden place. My initial shock and distaste had been gradually replaced 
          with a kind of anticipation. You had gotten me used to the occasional 
          fingertip, and we had talked about anal sex. Although I could never, 
          relaxed with you as I was, have voiced the thought - the seed of curiosity 
          had been well and truly planted.<br>
          You fucked me. Your cock slamming into me, ever harder, ever faster, 
          My mind, like my cunt, expanding and I wrapped my legs around your bucking 
          waist, heels hammering on your pumping, muscular buttocks. Until my 
          cunt, my virgin cunt, exploded in an intense, body jerking, mind blowing 
          orgasm as intense as any I have ever experienced. I heard your groan, 
          felt you shake and jerk in my arms, and your cock, your beautiful hard 
          thrusting cock, was jerked cruelly out of my liquid clasp, a hot slippery 
          pole sliding up the groove of my totally fucked cunt, and you spat your 
          seed into my flattened, soaking pubic bush and up over my belly. I struggled 
          under your weight, desperate to free myself, until you rolled off me, 
          onto your back. I forced my aching, tingling body to rise and kneel 
          over you, taking your sexily soiled hard on into my mouth. I licked 
          and sucked you clean of semen and pussy juices, revelling in that unique 
          blend of flavours&#133; You took my virginity, offered freely and I 
          committed a heinous act of pure debauchery in the eyes of my family&#133; 
          and it remains to this day, the most wonderful thing I have ever done.</p>
        <p>At the pool, in our little clearing behind the changing rooms. I gave 
          you a blow job, and with you hot and throbbing in my hand, begged you 
          to fuck me again. You took me from behind, as I bent forward, leaning 
          against the changing room wall. You tugged the material of my one piece 
          swimsuit aside. It was awkward, and you slipped out more than once. 
          But the sensation of your hardness, sliding up into my body, your hand 
          spreading the cheeks of my ass&#133; , my juices running down my inner 
          thighs like a veritable flood. Rear entry became my favourite from that 
          day on&#133; and despite the fear of discovery and hurry it engendered, 
          I loved you humping against my ass under the hot, African sun. I could 
          feel, and hear your climax approach and it did think that you were not 
          going to withdraw, and to my shame would have let you pump your seed 
          into me, risking what that entailed. But as ever, your common sense 
          overruled my lusts, as with a hoarse warning, your impaling spike was 
          withdrawn. I managed to spin round to take your cum in my mouth. I was 
          getting rather good at all this.<br>
          <br>
          Our third fuck was in the garden one more time, and I had the pleasurable 
          experience of lowering myself onto your hardness. You removed my pants 
          and left me in my skirt. With my t-shirt and bra hiked up exposing m 
          breasts, you had me squatting over you, impaled on your manhood. It 
          also allowed me to see.. see my dark, swollen lipped pussy sliding up 
          and down your pale, veined shaft. You jerked out of me at the last moment, 
          and wide eyed, I watched your slippery wet length, bob and jerk as you 
          spat your semen up over your belly. Mesmerised by the sight, I made 
          no effort to take you into my mouth.</p>
        <p>The end of the holidays came all too soon. And the knowledge that we 
          would be leaving Africa for good prayed on my mind, and finally drove 
          to desperation. Our final lovemaking&#133; I sneaked you into our house 
          for the second time, knowing my parents were out for dinner and would 
          be late home. You came three times that night. In my mouth as I sucked 
          you off in the middle of the living room floor, both of us fully dressed. 
          You picked me up and carried into my bedroom. I was still shy about 
          the little girl appearance, all frills and pastel colours, with too 
          much pink. You told me it looked nice.<br>
          You undressed me, removing every stitch of clothing, slowly, kissing 
          each exposed area of flesh. For only the second time I stood naked before 
          you. No longer the shy virgin, but as your lover. You performed what 
          I remember as an act of worship to my body. You kissed and paid homage 
          to every inch, every nook and cranny of my electrically charged body. 
          You spread my thighs, and I held them wide, tendon aching. You ate my 
          pussy, slow and unhurried, as I writhed and moaned and begged you to 
          fuck me. You had other plans, and turned me onto my side, and then you 
          turned around on me, confusing me as you faced my feet, your mouth still 
          pressed to my sex. As your hard cock was once more pressed to my face, 
          I discovered the confusing pleasure of a 69 for the first time. I lost 
          count of the number of times your tongue and fingers made me cum.. but 
          do remember your gushing cock filling my mouth a second time. </p>
        <p>We rested, and I kept a careful eye on the clock, knowing that you 
          would have to be gone and irresistibly, the hour of my parents return 
          crept up on us. We talked vaguely about our futures... silly things, 
          childish things, and we both knew that our destinies lay not within 
          our own hands. I became upset, fearful of the parting we knew must come. 
          You promised not to forget me... and I pretended to believe you. The 
          clock ticked, and our time diminished. &quot;I want you to cum inside 
          me... I want to feel you...&quot; I pleaded. You annoyed me by pointing 
          out that you came in my mouth. &quot;Its not the same!&quot; and a little 
          girl petulance infected my voice. You were gentle, but unyielding, &quot;We 
          - YOU - can't take that risk.&quot; I cursed your calm and common sense. 
          I pleaded some more and then you said &quot;There is an other way... 
          that would be safe.&quot; I knew immediately what you meant, remembering 
          how you had pressed a finger to my anus now and again. I took little 
          convincing...<br>
          &quot;I don't know&#133; wouldn't that hurt?&quot;<br>
          &quot;Not if you relax.. got any Vaseline?&quot; you grinned I was a 
          bit fearful of the pain and not at all sure that it was an acceptable 
          act of lovemaking. I let you finger the tight little hole, and found 
          it as previously, not unpleasant. I could see how much the idea turned 
          you on - and I was going to do whatever it took to give you your pleasure. 
          <br>
          At your urging I raided the bathroom cabinet and came back with the 
          a small jar of Vaseline. Despite having cum twice your cock was as hard 
          as ever. Then you lay me on my back, legs spread wide as you knelt and 
          entered my well fucked pussy once again. When you withdrew, and raised 
          my bum for the final act, I found my fears had been replaced with a 
          powerful feeling of anticipation. &quot;Relax.. this won't hurt a bit&quot;, 
          you intoned in your best dentist fashion, anointing my tight opening 
          and the length of your cock with Vaseline. You lied. It hurt. It hurt 
          like a hot poker in my ass&#133; but when I saw the concern on your 
          face I begged you not to stop. Despite the lubrication my asshole felt 
          as it was being torn open&#133; but slowly your gentle movements eased 
          and my abused opening relaxed. The pain lessened and a strange heat 
          began to build. You saw the change in my expression and began to force 
          your self deeper into me. Looking up at you, your expression concerned, 
          intent, your glance flicking from my face and then down to watch your 
          pale cock buggering my virginal brown asshole&#133; it is still with 
          me. You took my hand, unclenching my fingers and placing it over my 
          pussy. Encouraged by your awed and loving expression I understood, and 
          masturbated for you, rubbing my throbbing clitoris, fingering my recently 
          fucked pussy hole. I could feel you! I could feel your cock, through 
          the thin wall of my vagina&#133; and your expression told me that you 
          could feel my finger. To my surprise, I could feel the onset of an orgasm.. 
          a new sensation, your hardness in my ass, my finger, your expression 
          of loving lust.. You started those fast shallow strokes, that with my 
          recently won experience, told me that you were close to cuming. You 
          really did like my ass! &quot;Cum inside me..&quot; I managed to gasp 
          and you did. Feeling you jerk, your hardness pulse, was enough to trigger 
          my own uniquely anal orgasm. I was unlike anything I have ever experienced 
          since. Three times a woman had been a line you explained to me at that 
          first party - mouth, cunt and ass.</p>
        <p>You made it out of the house with minuets to spare, any longer, and 
          you would have been trapped inside. Nothing like bars on all the windows 
          to maintain a sense of urgency. I stripped the bed after you left, and 
          soaked in the bath until my parents became worried. Worried about me 
          bathing too long! If only they had known. Then I was gone. Back to Malaysia, 
          back to my cultural prison. I put you away, like a childhood toy that 
          you are ashamed to remember how much you loved. The memory of you faded, 
          like a dream, but never disappeared. My eventual marriage was one of 
          practicality and common sense, not passion. Every time my dutiful husband 
          parted my thighs to perform his husbandly duty, the sense of anticipation 
          I felt was never realised, a nagging, unspecified memory telling me 
          that I was missing something.</p>
        <p>So, despite my respectability, my marriage vows, not to mention cultural 
          taboos, I will meet with you. My memories are too powerful, my fingers 
          are jammed too deep inside my aching pussy. The memory of you haunts 
          my tongue - and that young, wild child lives once more in this middle 
          aged body. I will be in that bar tomorrow night, and I will want fucking 
          - fucking out of my mind.<br>
          And maybe, just maybe, I will have another story to write&#133;&#133;<br>
