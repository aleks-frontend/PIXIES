          B was an amazing girl. I always knew I loved her, from the first time 
          I met her. She has shoulder-length blonde/brown hair, blue eyes, and 
          the best body you had ever seen, full rounded breasts, which must have 
          been a Double D cup, even though she was only eighteen, like me.</p>
        <p>After a few months, B and I became good friends, you could even say 
          best friends, we used to go all kinds of places together, swimming, 
          bowling, the cinema, everywhere! </p>
        <p>One Sunday we decided to go for a walk along the river, so we walked 
          along the towpath arm in arm. Now previously we had never let anything 
          seriously physical spoil our friendship, but today, B seemed very excited, 
          I do not know how, I could just tell.</p>
        <p>We stopped about half way along our walk, and walked down a woodland 
          path, and found an old secluded picnic table. It was badly vandalised, 
          and had teenage scribbling all over it, but we sat down anyway.</p>
        <p>I think B must have realised that we could not be seen by anyone, and 
          so she leaned over, and lightly kissed me, just on the cheek. I turned 
          to her and said I liked that, and she said that we could kiss properly, 
          if I wanted. I did not answer her, I simply took her in my arms and 
          gave her the most passionate kiss I had ever given before. As my tongue 
          explored her mouth, I wondered if she was good at sucking dick.</p>
        <p>As if she had sensed what I was thinking, she slowly moved her hand 
          down to my cock, and started rubbing it through my pants. We stopped 
          kissing for a second, and she said to me, &quot;Do you like that?&quot; 
          I nodded and we resumed our kiss. Now, she slowly unzipped my pants, 
          and pulled down my underwear, exposing my hardened cock to the summer 
          forest.</p>
        <p>She slowly began to run her hand up and down it, very slowly, and eventually 
          had it fully gripped in her hand. She stopped kissing me again, looked 
          me long in my eyes, and moved her head down to my cock. She started 
          to lick it first, just the head, then all the way to the base, and back 
          again.</p>
        <p>I loved this feeling, her gentle tongue brushing against my shaft. 
          She looked up at me again, and slowly put the cock in her mouth, and 
          began to suck. Just lightly at first, oh it felt so good having her 
          lips on my pecker.</p>
        <p>She slowly began to suck harder and harder, until it developed into 
          a full-on BJ. I stroked her hair as she sucked, and sighed with pleasure. 
          This was an amazing feeling, and I think that we were best friends made 
          it all the better. I wasn't sure if we would develop into sexual partners 
          after this, but that was hardly the most important thing on my mind 
          as B's tongue sucked all the pre-cum from my head.</p>
        <p>I told her that I was about to cum, and she didn't try to take her 
          mouth away, she kept it right where it was, sucking harder than a vacuum. 
          As I released my sticky load deep down her throat, she swallowed the 
          whole lot, looked up to me and said &quot;Let's go back to my place&#133;&quot;</p>
