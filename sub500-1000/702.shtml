        <p>I woke up one morning and knew without a doubt that this was the end 
          of my <br>
          relationship with Peter. He had been my boyfriend for most of high school, 
          <br>
          we had grown up together, and he had been so much a part of me that 
          I'd <br>
          never really thought about leaving him. But during the past year we 
          had <br>
          grown apart, him settling down in a small town life, set to start working 
          <br>
          with his dad in the family business. Whereas I had applied to fourteen 
          <br>
          different colleges, got in to twelve of them and now had to make a decision. 
          Go to the local college - academically fair, but boring as our town 
          - or <br>
          leave for real. And when it came to the crunch it wasn't even a difficult 
          decision. I was already on my way to California. I was eighteen, and 
          nothing could stop me.<br>
          Breaking up wasn't easy, but I had noticed Peter giving a couple of 
          local girls the eye every now and then, and knew he'd get over it quick 
          enough. It was nice, not parting with a big bang. We had learned a lot 
          from each other, including physical stuff like kissing and some petting, 
          but I was still a virgin and so, to my knowledge, was he. So I thought 
          he'd deserved a present for putting up with me for those years. It had 
          been my decision not to fuck him, because in a small town - if you fucked 
          your boyfriend, everyone knew. Now I was leaving it didn't matter, though. 
          I intended to fuck a lot of guys from now on.<br>
          I hadn't missed not having sex so far too much, because after all there 
          was a lot you could do on your own. I'd even bought a dildo on a school 
          trip to Chicago, sneaking off one evening and choosing one after how 
          many fingers I could get into my pussy while masturbating, which was 
          basically two, and that took some doing. So the one I chose was short 
          and a little over an inch thick, and while I loved playing with it (before, 
          it had been a question of searching around the house for a new thing 
          to try) it had not prepared me for the real thing.<br>
          When the day before I was to leave for college arrived I had it all 
          planned. <br>
          My parents were out for the day looking at farms - my dad was retiring 
          at <br>
          the end of the year and they wanted to live out in the country - and 
          I called Peter and told him to come over.<br>
          &quot;I've got something for you, sweetie.&quot;<br>
          He didn't waste any time, perhaps he thought I had changed my mind about 
          going, and anyway as our houses were only a hundred yards or so apart 
          on the same street it took him less than five minutes to walk over. 
          I saw him arrive from the kitchen window and went to open the door, 
          thinking that having this hunky boyfriend for so long and NOT having 
          sex with him was really a waste. I had just showered and dried my hair, 
          I wore no makeup except some waterproof mascara and a lot of deep cherry 
          red lipstick which I normally never wore.<br>
          My whole body was smooth and silky, including my pussy lips under my 
          blonde little bush that I left on for gym showers and so on, and as 
          I opened the door I smiled as Peter's jaw dropped. Well, I was wearing 
          a pair of black high heeled pumps. Nothing else.<br>
          To give Peter credit, it didn't take him long to recover. He was grinning 
          when I took his hand and pulled him inside, and even before the door 
          closed he was kissing me. And boy, he was a great kisser. For many weeks 
          and months now my Saturday nights had always been the same: out with 
          Peter, some kissing in his car in the driveway, me staggering inside 
          absolutely insane with arousal and sometimes having an orgasm while 
          walking upstairs, without having to do anything. Once inside the safetly 
          of my room, with the door locked, I invariably stripped naked, and taking 
          care to be as silent as possible I caressed myself to another orgasm, 
          always thinking up some new position to practise, or some new addition 
          to my now essential little dildo. I had a stash of suitably shaped household 
          utensils (like a spatula with a nicely rounded handle, a couple of candles 
          in different lengths, some marker pens with their caps glued shut) in 
          a drawer, and put them to good use. I had trained myself in sucking 
          the dildo too, working up the muscles in my jaw so that I could suck 
          for a long time without getting tired. Once I had a rigorous training 
          regime that consisted of me not being allowed to touch my clit, nor 
          come without the dildo in my mouth, for a month. So I was pretty well 
          trained, considering I was still a virgin. Technically.<br>
          But back to the present. Peter's present. He kissed me and let his hands 
          roam freely over my naked body, knowing without being told (he wasn't 
          exactly stupid) that everything was allowed. I gasped in delight as 
          his hands closed firmly over my naked buttocks and though I had showered 
          just five minutes ago I could feel the moisture between my pussy lips. 
          I was so easily wet nowadays. Peter pulled back his head so that our 
          lips parted for a moment and asked, sounding unlike himself.<br>
          &quot;Walk up and down so I can see you properly.&quot;<br>
          I smiled and obeyed, parading down the hall and into the living room, 
          where I had drawn the curtains earlier on. We had some new leather sofas 
          that were just right for a little naughtiness. Peter followed me and 
          said, sounding stern and hoarse.<br>
          &quot;And twirl. Beautiful - God, I've waited too long for this.&quot; 
          I stopped in front of the low living room table and looked at him.<br>
          &quot;Me too. Want to fuck?&quot;<br>
          &quot;Oh yes. Come here.&quot;<br>
          He sat down in a big leather armchair and leaned back, somehow sensing 
          that in spite of my boldness, he was very much in charge. I approached 
          warily and gasped as he unzipped his jeans and took out his cock - I 
          had never seen anything so big. It dwarfed my little dildo by several 
          inches in length and at least two in width, and as Peter ran his hand 
          up and down the shaft it continued to grow. I moaned.<br>
          &quot;Peter, it's huge! Can I change my mind?&quot;<br>
          He smiled and asked silkily.<br>
          &quot;Do you want to?&quot;<br>
          I bit my lip and shook my head, feeling my pussy lips swelling as I 
          stopped in front of him. He looked at me, not smiling anymore.<br>
          &quot;Get down on your knees. Here, use this pillow.&quot;<br>
          My hands trembled as I placed the pillow by his feet and kneeled down 
          in front of him, my face ending up just level with his cock. Seen this 
          close it looked intimidating to say the least and I shivered.<br>
          &quot;Wow. Let me feel it.&quot;<br>
          He took his hand away and I leaned in, taking the length of it in my 
          hand <br>
          and sliding my fingers up and down the shaft. Peter groaned and I sensed 
          a <br>
          power shift again - I could do whatever I wanted with him. Smiling briefly,<br>
          I decided to taste it and found it salty and pleasant, and after a couple 
          of experimental licks that caused him acute discomfort I paused and 
          looked up at him.<br>
          &quot;Want me to suck it?&quot;<br>
          He opened his eyes and in reply just put his hand behind my head and 
          brought my lips down towards his cock, and I opened my mouth wider than 
          at the dentist as I felt the meat slide in, smudging my lipstick and 
          pressing against the back of my mouth. Desparate not to gag, I swallowed 
          frantically, and could hear Peter groaning again and again. His hand 
          guided me to take more of it in my mouth than I thought possible, and 
          then as the pressure eased I slid the long hard cock out of my mouth 
          until only the head was inside. He pressed hard again and I opened my 
          mouth wider again, feeling my mouth invaded, and amazed at how much 
          of it I could swallow. And I also found I liked it.<br>
          This was really a surprise - my sessions with the dildo, though frequent 
          and thorough, had only been part of my self imposed regime and not really 
          enjoyable. But apparently all that training had paid off - I got wetter 
          and wetter at the unbelievable sensation of his cock sliding in and 
          out of me, even if it was my mouth and not yet my pussy. Soon I was 
          finding the rhythm that kept him gasping for air, groaning and clutching 
          my hair, and before I knew it he was shouting and thrusting into my 
          mouth and I felt a huge warm shower of cum filling my mouth. I had to 
          swallow again so as not to choke, and after what seemed like a pint 
          or so I licked him off thoroughly and reluctantly let all of his cock 
          slide out of my mouth.<br>
          Peter was sweating and panting, but smiled at me, keeping a handful 
          of my hair in his fist and saying, as soon as he had got his breath 
          back.<br>
          &quot;That was fantastic, Annie. You suck like a pro. Was that really 
          your first time?&quot;<br>
          I pouted and blushed, but told him.<br>
          &quot;Yeah, for real - but I've trained a bit on my own.&quot;<br>
          He wiped the sweat off his forehead and helped me up so I was standing 
          in front of him.<br>
          &quot;What with?&quot;<br>
          I squirmed and he laughed.<br>
          &quot;Come on, Annie, you're obviously not the little innocent you've 
          been acting. What with?&quot;<br>
          &quot;Okay, okay - I bought a little dildo.&quot;<br>
          &quot;You did? Good girl. Where is it?&quot;<br>
          &quot;Upstairs.&quot;<br>
          &quot;Well, go and get it while I get my breath back.&quot;<br>
          I stared at him and he frowned.<br>
          &quot;What are you waiting for? Want me to give you a pat on the ass 
          to make up your mind?&quot; That made me turn and almost run up the 
          stairs - Peter had always been fond <br>
          of giving me a hearty slap on the ass at every opportunity. It turned 
          me on like nothing else, but it also stung even through jeans, and now 
          I was butt naked. As soon as I could I returned downstairs with the 
          dildo in my hand, and saw he was up and had zipped his jeans again. 
          He met me by the sofa and we kissed deeply, and he laughed as he saw 
          the little black rubber dildo in my hand.<br>
          &quot;Not very big, is it? Come here, baby.&quot;<br>
          He took my hand and led me to the big black sofa, and sat down on the 
          table top.<br>
          &quot;See, this isn't over just because I came. Lie down on your back.&quot; 
          I did as he said, it felt like the only thing to do, and he looked down 
          on <br>
          me with a smile.<br>
          &quot;Boy, you have a beautiful body. Love your hairdo.&quot; I was 
          past blushing now, and too much in heat to be embarrassed, so I just 
          gave him a lazy smile and lifted my right leg up over the back of the 
          sofa, revealing my pink, round, perfectly shaved pussy lips with the 
          crack between them glistening wet. Peter sighed.<br>
          &quot;Oh yes. Show me how you make yourself come.&quot;<br>
          That wasn't exactly hard - I would have come in a minute anyway, even 
          without any touch. Now I just slid the head of the dildo in between 
          my pussy lips, running it lightly up and down from clit to entrance 
          and back, and in less than a minute I tensed and arched my back, taken 
          so much by surprise that I moaned and gasped and trembled wildly though 
          I was used to keeping it down. The pleasure was short and sharp and 
          left me hungry for more - I opened my eyes to find Peter watching me 
          with a smile on his lips and his hand over his crotch.<br>
          &quot;Beautiful, Annie - you woke my cock again just by doing that. 
          I think I'm going to taste you too.&quot;<br>
          And before I could even regain full control of my senses after the orgasm 
          he had taken me by the ankles and pulled me towards him, parting my 
          thighs and diving down between them like he had practised too. His tongue 
          found my clit and started to flick back and forth over it, insistently 
          and quickly, making it impossible for me to do anything else but let 
          myself go again. My second orgasm came only a minute after the first 
          and was more intense, longer and extremely pleasurable. I had to scream 
          as I shook in ecstasy, Peter's tongue never missing a beat, not stopping 
          until I was well on my way down from seventh heaven again. He wiped 
          his face on his sleeve and sat down in the other end of the big sofa, 
          waiting for me to look at him before saying.<br>
          &quot;You're magnificent. And you taste good.&quot;<br>
          &quot;So do you.&quot;<br>
          &quot;Where's that dildo? I want to see if you have done this at home.&quot; 
          I felt around for the black rubber shaft and handed it to him, he got 
          up and <br>
          walked to the bathroom, coming back with the head of the dildo entirely 
          covered in white cream. I watched him come, not knowing what he was 
          going to do. He smiled at my blank expression.<br>
          &quot;So, you have a bit of innocence left after all... Get up.&quot; 
          I did so, on trembling legs, and faced him. He smiled a devilish smile 
          and <br>
          showed me the now slippery dildo.<br>
          &quot;I'm going to put this up your ass.&quot;<br>
          I nearly jumped and my eyes widened - this I had never thought of. Sure, 
          I had caressed myself around my anus too, and enjoyed the sensation, 
          but putting my dildo inside had never even occurred to me.<br>
          &quot;You're what?&quot;<br>
          He chuckled and pointed towards the sofa.<br>
          &quot;Get behind that arm and lean over it.&quot;<br>
          I just stared at him and sure enough, he reached over and gave me a 
          pretty hard slap on the ass. It stung, and I jumped, moving automatically 
          towards the sofa.<br>
          &quot;Ow!&quot;<br>
          &quot;There's more of that if you're going to be difficult. Bend over 
          it.&quot; Seeing no way out and feeling a surge of new arousal inside 
          me, I hesitantly <br>
          did as he said and tried to peer over my shoulder to see what was going 
          on. I could feel everything - he came up behind me, pressed me down 
          so my ass was high in the air and moved my legs a bit apart using his 
          foot.<br>
          Then I felt a cool, slippery object between my ass cheeks, felt it press 
          insistently against my anus and then before I had time to tense up it 
          slipped inside and was rammed up in its entire length. I gasped and 
          screamed, from pleasure and pain and all kinds of different sensations, 
          and promptly recieved a stinging slap on my other buttock.<br>
          &quot;Shut up - it went just as it should. Keep still.&quot;<br>
          I caught my breath and in a little while the pain receded, and I felt 
          the dildo start to slide out. Peter pushed it in again, making me gasp, 
          but there was definitely more of a thrill than real agony now. He leaned 
          over me and I could feel the bulge in his jeans, and he whispered in 
          my ear.<br>
          &quot;What do you think of your new toy?&quot;<br>
          I couldn't reply and he retaliated by pushing the dildo deep up me again, 
          and I moaned and felt another orgasm building. Peter laughed as he felt 
          me writhe, and asked again.<br>
          &quot;Tell me, what do you think? Don't you like it? I have a bigger 
          one in my jeans...&quot;<br>
          That snapped me to attention, all right, and I gasped breathlessly.<br>
          &quot;This one's fine - ow! - yes, really, Peter, I love it - ow! - 
          I'm going to cum!&quot;<br>
          His hand slid in under me and hsi fingers started to massage my clit 
          and the swollen flesh around it.<br>
          &quot;Really? So you like a little action behind?&quot;<br>
          I didn't reply because I was so busy enjoying the mixed sensations of 
          pleasure and pain and shame coursing through my body, and moments later 
          I again trembled in an all time orgasm. This one was deep, and intense, 
          and longer than any I could remember having, and left me nearly unconscious. 
          I could feel the dildo slide out of my ass and the thing that brought 
          me back to attention was another slap, and then another, on my by now 
          pink ass cheeks. Peter didn't intend to let me slack off, obviously.<br>
          &quot;Hey, no time to sleep, beauty. We're still going to fuck.&quot;</p>
