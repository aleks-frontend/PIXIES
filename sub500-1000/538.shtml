<p>It had been a lousy day that day anyway&#133;so no reason to expect 
          it would end any better.right? But I never in my wildest dreams expected 
          the ending that really did happen.<br>
          Thoughts of my former Master had been running through my head for weeks 
          now.which was usually an indication that He was thinking of me too&#133;but 
          since we had split months ago&#133;I dismissed those thoughts and just 
          shoved them to the back of my mind&#133;but the nagging thought was 
          always there&#133;what would I do if He would come back? How would I 
          react? What would I say? The ending was so abrupt with Him, only an 
          e-mail telling me that He was leaving town and wouldn't be back. I had 
          never gotten any closure on it with Him&#133;and it was totally unexpected. 
          This man was my life&#133;. my world&#133;and my world came crashing 
          down around me with that single letter. But I picked myself up and carried 
          on&#133;the days seemed endless&#133;and the nights even worse&#133;my 
          rock was gone&#133;the one I clung to when the world around me was tossing 
          me around like a leaf in the wind&#133;the one whose strength I could 
          always rely on&#133;the one who could talk me out of any mood I was 
          in and make my world bright and safe again...the one I loved more than 
          life itself. Was if my fault He left? Did I cling too hard? Did I demand 
          too much of Him as my Master? Was I not good enough? &#133;Obedient 
          enough?&#133;sexual enough?&#133;surely it was my fault that He left.</p>
        <p>Class had let out early that night&#133;and I was in a bad mood anyway 
          because I had to give a presentation on my final paper&#133;which I 
          thought I had done terribly &#133;all the things I should have said 
          and done kept running through my mind as I drove home that night&#133;and 
          I was kicking myself for not doing better. I pulled into my driveway 
          and wasn't really paying attention too much&#133;just was glad to be 
          home and have the night behind me. As I stepped out of the car I thought 
          I saw the red glow of a cigarette at the steps of my house&#133;but 
          thought I was being crazy and paranoid&#133;and then there He was&#133;leaning 
          against the banister of the porch&#133;impeccably dressed as always&#133;the 
          moonlight playing on the soft ebony of His skin&#133;my heart stopped 
          and I know my eyes had to get wide as saucers&#133;I was over this man 
          now&#133;why did He still have such an effect on me? I had moved on&#133;was 
          seeing another Dom&#133;one that I was crazy about&#133;and yet in that 
          instant&#133;when I saw Master Lee standing there&#133;my world flip 
          flopped again and I knew that I hadn't really resolved all the issues 
          of the break up.</p>
        <p>&quot;Hello baby, you're looking beautiful as ever&quot;,&#133;His 
          voice was like a soothing balm to my soul&#133;creeping into every crevice 
          of my being&#133;my nipples instantly hardened and I could feel the 
          wetness in my panties&#133;my body was betraying me&#133;in spite of 
          all that I had been through&#133;all the pain and heartache&#133;I still 
          wanted and needed this man&#133;I was speechless&#133;when I finally 
          found my voice I muttered a hello&#133;my eyes never leaving His&#133;searching 
          them&#133;looking for what I don't know&#133;He quickly came back with&#133;&quot;I 
          can't stay angel&#133;I just wanted to let you know why I left&#133;where 
          I've been&#133;and that I'm ok&#133;my hands were shaking as I opened 
          the door&#133;and He followed me into the house&#133;sitting in His 
          favorite chair&#133;the one that we had went out and bought together 
          for Him when He was at my house&#133;I just couldn't get rid of it&#133;I 
          pulled the cushion out and sat next to Him at the foot of the chair&#133;and 
          slowly began to eat as His story unraveled&#133;when I was done eating 
          I got up&#133;never asking permission&#133;just doing it&#133;and poured 
          us both a glass of red wine&#133;and continued to listen as He told 
          me of His journeys overseas&#133;how he had left everything behind&#133;that 
          He was working on a farm for the summer and was going back out of the 
          country in the fall&#133;my mind was spinning&#133;why was He here?&#133;.all 
          the emotions came flooding back in one fell swoop&#133;I knew at that 
          instant that I still loved Him&#133;probably always would&#133;and no 
          matter who I was with&#133;this man would always hold a piece of my 
          heart that I would never be able to give to anyone else&#133;</p>
        <p>I kept refilling our wine glasses and by the time His story was finished 
          we were both pretty relaxed &#133;and I was feeling more at ease being 
          around Him again&#133;I knew He still wanted me and loved me &#133;not 
          only from the tenderness in His voice&#133;but also from the bulge in 
          His pants&#133;the sexual tension was so thick you could have cut it 
          with a knife&#133;and I knew that even though I would never see this 
          man again in my life&#133;and that He meant every word He was saying 
          to me&#133;that I had to have Him one last time&#133;</p>
        <p>I rose silently from my place at His feet and walked over to the stereo&#133;I 
          could feel His eyes on the sway of my hips&#133;and felt them lingering 
          on my tight little ass&#133;chills shot up my spine as I felt Him mentally 
          undressing me&#133;as I bent over the music rack my shorts slid higher 
          up my thighs&#133;and I knew He could see the bottom of my asscheeks&#133;my 
          hands slid to my ass and I ran them over the soft material of the shorts 
          as I was looking for the music that He had left here also &#133;.i finally 
          found a few CD's of the jazz that He loved so much&#133;and played&#133;and 
          the thought ran through my mind that I wondered if He still played the 
          trumpet? The music was soft and haunting as it filtered through the 
          speakers&#133;and as soon as I turned around&#133;His eyes were caressing 
          every inch of my body&#133;I knew he could see how hard my nipples were.but 
          I wondered if He knew how wet I was? </p>
        <p>I took my place back on the cushion&#133;only this time I moved the 
          cushion directly in front of Him&#133;we both knew we were going to 
          make love that night&#133;that this was going to be the closure that 
          we both needed so badly&#133;but didn't want. </p>
        <p>I laid my head on His thigh and just took long slow deep breaths&#133;filling 
          myself with His scent&#133;imprinting it into my memory to call upon 
          when I would need that comfort again&#133;His strong fingers were running 
          absently through my hair and we were both lost in thought&#133;sharing 
          that quiet moment that only two lovers know who don't need words to 
          express their thoughts&#133;</p>
        <p>And then His fingers were entwining in my hair &#133;softly at first&#133;then 
          harder&#133;and He lifted my head to meet His eyes&#133;they spoke volumes 
          to me&#133;as mine did to Him&#133;and then His mouth was on mine in 
          one sweeping motion&#133;devouring me&#133;His tongue sliding into my 
          mouth as a soft moan escaped from me&#133;His kiss was urgent&#133;tender&#133;demanding&#133;yielding&#133;all 
          at once&#133;and I responded in turn&#133;</p>
        <p>My hands slid up His thighs&#133;caressing&#133;teasing&#133;torturing 
          Him and me with the soft insistent touches&#133;as He broke the kiss 
          I nibbled on His bottom lip and then my hands slid up to His chest.. 
          my palms sliding over His nipples in a slow circular motion&#133;feeling 
          them hardening and then grinning up at Him as I slid His shirt off of 
          Him&#133;.that beautiful chocolate skin once again drowning my senses&#133;a 
          small gasp escaping from me as I leaned forward and the tip of my tongue 
          pressed against one nipple&#133;and then the other&#133;my body was 
          aching for Him at this point&#133;and He then took off my tank top and 
          undid my bra&#133;and then He slowly began slapping my tits&#133;first 
          one&#133;then the other&#133;. then both of them at the same time&#133;softly 
          at first&#133;and then harder and faster&#133;my eyes were closed and 
          with each stinging blow my clit would tingle harder and I knew He was 
          going to make me cum like that before He would allow me to serve Him&#133;I 
          was so lost in the rhythm of His strong hands as they would slap the 
          full part of my breasts&#133;and then hard on the nipple&#133;and then 
          soft on the underside&#133;and then the pattern would start all over 
          again&#133;with His free hand He pulled and pinched the nipple of the 
          tit that He wasn't assaulting&#133;and soon the wetness was trickling 
          down my thighs&#133;He just smiled when He saw my juices flowing&#133;and 
          continued to slap and pull and pull and slap&#133;leaving His handprints 
          all over my breasts until finally my body trembled&#133;and His words 
          came somewhere from the distance&#133;cum for me my slut&#133;for you 
          will always be my little cum slut princess&#133;.a low moan filled the 
          room as my release washed over me&#133;and the moment I began to cum 
          His fingers twisted and pulled on my nipples on so hard I screamed out 
          to Him in pleasure/pain&#133;and then I collapsed against His thigh 
          again&#133;catching my breath&#133;waiting for my heartbeat to slow 
          down&#133;</p>
        <p>As soon as I regained my senses a bit&#133;my eyes looked up into His 
          again&#133;so hungry for Him still&#133;so needy of His touch still&#133;and 
          my fingertips slid under the waistband of His pants&#133;playing with 
          the skin&#133;each touch sending an electric jolt through me&#133;I 
          wondered how I had stood not serving Him for this long&#133;and how 
          I was going to bear never seeing Him again&#133;I quickly pushed those 
          thoughts out of my head as His hips lifted and I tugged at His pants&#133;pulling 
          them and His shorts down&#133;. His thick black cock springing free 
          from its confinement&#133;and my eyes widened as they always did whenever 
          I saw that beautiful cock&#133;my throat constricted and His taste came 
          back to me as if it were only yesterday that I had served His cock with 
          my mouth&#133;my soft white hand wrapped around the thickness of His 
          shaft&#133;and I marveled once again at the contrast of skin color&#133;but 
          only for a moment&#133;and then my lips were pressed against the tip 
          of His cock.my tongue running lightly under the head&#133;and I knew 
          I was serving the only cock that I was ever meant to serve in this lifetime&#133;that 
          this was my one true Master&#133;my hand slid slowly up the length..squeezing 
          the first few drops of precum out &#133;and as I looked up into His 
          eyes&#133;I smeared the sweet drops over my lips and cheeks&#133;wanting 
          them to seep into my pores&#133;to be a part of me forever&#133;</p>
        <p>My hunger for Him was so great that my throat opened instantly&#133;and 
          I slid his whole black cock deep deep into my hungry mouth&#133;my lips 
          were pressed so hard against the base of His suck while I sucked hungrily 
          on Him&#133;His moans only excited me more&#133;and His fingers entwined 
          in my hair sent thrills through me like no other man could ever do&#133;His 
          hips arched higher&#133;forcing His cock deeper into my throat&#133;and 
          my throat just opened wider&#133;I don't think His cock had ever been 
          that deep in my mouth before&#133;I was fighting for air&#133;struggling 
          almost&#133;but I didn't want to take my mouth off of that cock&#133;.not 
          yet anyway&#133;I could feel it pulsing in my mouth&#133;and as I slowly 
          moved my mouth back up the tip&#133;one hand reached down to squeeze 
          His balls&#133;I knew He knew what was coming next&#133;and of course 
          He was right&#133;the flat part of my tongue slid down the length of 
          His delicious cock&#133;and my face was between His thighs&#133;I dragged 
          my tongue slowly over His balls&#133;leaving a wet hot trail and then 
          blew softly over the wetness&#133;as the goosebumps rose on His thighs 
          and His breath caught a bit&#133;I engulfed His balls deep into my mouth&#133;I 
          just couldn't get enough of Him&#133;I wanted it all&#133;and I wanted 
          it all at once&#133;I pushed His knees up a bit and my tongue then slid 
          along the crack of His ass&#133;when I reached His opening&#133;my tongue 
          stiffened and I pushed just the tip of it into His ass as my hand stroked 
          His cock&#133;I knew He was about to cum&#133;and that cum wasn't going 
          to be wasted spraying out into the air&#133;my tongue left a hot wet 
          trail from His ass to the tip of His cock&#133;flicking under the head 
          a few times as I watched His face contort in pure pleasure&#133;and 
          then as soon as He came&#133;I grasped His cock and sprayed it all over 
          my face and hair&#133;smiling up at Him as rope after rope of His hot 
          thick cum covered my cheeks, eyes, hair and mouth&#133;His body was 
          trembling from His intense orgasm&#133;but I wasn't done yet&#133;ohhhh 
          no&#133;my mouth immediately clamped onto His cock again&#133;swallowing 
          the last drops of His cum as I began to suck on Him again&#133;He whispered 
          a protest&#133;but I continued on until His cock was rock hard again.</p>
        <p>Reaching for His hand and pulling Him to the floor with me&#133;then 
          gently pressing back on His chest&#133;oh yes&#133;this hot pussy was 
          gonna have that cock in her one last time&#133;I straddled Him&#133;my 
          slender thighs pressing tightly against His strong muscular ones&#133;and 
          my hot cunt hovered inches over His cock&#133;leaning down to kiss Him 
          hungrily&#133;His cum still on my lips &#133;and then sliding the head 
          of His cock slowly along the wetness of my slit&#133;my muscles were 
          contracting already and He wasn't even in me yet&#133;I could barely 
          stand it anymore as I slowly slid the massive head into my throbbing 
          cunt&#133;my nails dug deep into His arms and my breath was coming in 
          small short gasps as He filled me totally&#133;spreading my aching cunt 
          wide&#133;my muscles clamped around that cock so tight it almost forced 
          it out of me&#133;but I just kept on fucking Him&#133;slow and easy&#133;.fast 
          and hard&#133;muscles loosening and then clamping tightly around Him 
          again&#133;my juices were running down His cock like a river &#133;and 
          I would just grind harder and deeper into Him&#133;taking my fill for 
          the rest of my lifetime&#133;</p>
        <p>And then suddenly He took control again&#133;flipping us over and raising 
          my legs over His shoulders&#133;His cock pounding deep into me&#133;each 
          stroke leaving me screaming out to Him&#133;His lips kissing my thighs 
          and biting &#133;and then slamming His shaft deep into my wetness again&#133;I 
          didn't want to cum&#133;I wanted this to last forever&#133;so I fought 
          my climax every inch of the way knowing He was still good for awhile 
          as this was His second round&#133;His fingers probed my ass and slid 
          deep into my tight little star&#133;and then suddenly His cock was out 
          of my cunt and in my ass&#133;the pain ripped through me and then the 
          pleasure&#133;He took my ass like never before that night&#133;pounding 
          His cock deeper and deeper as my screams tore through the room&#133;my 
          body was exhausted at this point&#133;and I knew I couldn't last much 
          longer&#133;His grunts and moans were coming harder and faster now&#133;and 
          then His voice almost screaming in my ear&#133;.NOW SLUT!! CUM NOW!! 
          And instantly my body stiffened and a flood of cum poured out of me 
          as His cum shot into my ass&#133;</p>
        <p>Tears were streaming down my face as He collapsed on me&#133;my arms 
          wrapped around Him tightly and I just held Him close to me&#133;whispering 
          how much I loved Him&#133;How much I always would&#133;and how much 
          I was going to miss Him&#133;we fell asleep in each others arms&#133;and 
          when I woke up the next morning&#133;He was gone&#133;leaving only a 
          note left next to where He was laying&#133;I love you my angel slut&#133;and 
          I will never forget you&#133;<br>
