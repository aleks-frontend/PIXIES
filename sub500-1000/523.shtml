              <p>I felt like an outsider when Samantha dragged me along to her 
                club, The Nebula. I knew I would be an alien, unwelcome and obscene 
                in a panorama of unfamiliar things. Even the language would be 
                foreign to me, common English broken and browbeaten into something 
                exotic, full of spice and unimagined texture. Even the music, 
                which I've been told is universal, would be an uncharted frontier 
                for me. Jazz. Even that simple term seems strange, like it's alive 
                and leads a mysterious life all its own somewhere in dark, shaded 
                alleys and fragrant, sultry back rooms. Knowing this, imagining 
                untold embarrassment as others, native to The Nebula spotted me 
                and screamed something akin to &quot;infidel&quot; at me; I still 
                agreed to go with Sam. The old Nordic bloodline reared its savage 
                head and called me a coward, so I gave in. There was an urge, 
                a deep seated desire in the depth of my psyche demanding I discover 
                this new world and conquer a place, some small place to call my 
                own. </p>
              <p>A forlorn, lost soldier dressing for a duel looked back from 
                the mirror while I was getting ready. My closet was subjected 
                to the utmost scrutiny, and anything with a hint of flash was 
                discarded. I sought to blend in, as well as a Nordic blonde just 
                three inches shy of six feet might. I dressed seeking camouflage: 
                navy slacks and a close fitting turtleneck. I wanted to blend 
                into the nearest wall I could find in The Nebula. I pulled my 
                moon-silver hair back into a ponytail, slipped on some flats, 
                and ran outside to Samantha's car.</p>
              <p>The Nebula was dark and smoke filled, and stepping inside was 
                like being crushed by a solid wall of sound. We made our way to 
                a postage stamp table, a small lush black woman yelling greetings 
                to anyone who would listen, and a silent white Amazon trying her 
                best to slink through the press of bodies unnoticed. The fabulously 
                beautiful waitress took our orders, a martini for Sam and a badly 
                needed bourbon for me. I took a quick survey under my lashes for 
                anyone staring accusingly at me, and only found a few curious, 
                even admiring glances. The weight I'd been carrying all day fell 
                from my shoulders, leaving only a soft veneer of relief. </p>
              <p>With my biggest fear addressed, and no one treating me obviously 
                like an outsider, I settled back to enjoy the music. There was 
                plenty of it. In one of the close corners of the room, there was 
                a stingy slice of stage, home to a mismatched collection of musicians 
                in varying shades of chocolate. Two of the men were refugee-skinny, 
                with amazingly long fingers stroking ivory keys and heavy bass 
                strings, respectively. A radiant, gorgeously rounded woman clutched 
                the mic stand like a lover, humming and crooning in the throes 
                of something I've only felt in the darkest, sweatiest parts of 
                the night. Watching her made my inner core thrum and throb in 
                sympathy to the heady, animalistic mood she was weaving over the 
                audience. <br>
                <br>
                I tore myself away from the seductive hypnotism she was building 
                note by husky note. I turned my attention then to the third male 
                on the sliver of stage. My breath caught in my throat. He was 
                tall, around six three or four, and every inch radiated lean muscle. 
                His hands were amazing: broad and solid, wrapped around a gleaming 
                brass sax. His eyes were closed, his long thick lashes brushing 
                his high cheekbones. I found myself following the lean, sculpted 
                line of his body downward. He wore black slacks snugly contoured 
                to his thighs, and I found myself staring at the apex of his exquisite, 
                long legs. His pants were snug there, as well, and smoothly outlining 
                manhood a Greek god would have been proud of. <br>
                <br>
                I caught myself breathing hard, staring at this caramel coloured 
                beauty onstage. I drew my gaze back up his fabulous body to his 
                strong face, fascinated by his mouth as he blew soul-shattering 
                notes from his sax. Some increasingly lusty demon in me willed 
                him to look up, to open his eyes and see me. The heavy music he 
                was making vibrated the floor, seeming to radiate across the narrow 
                club and find haven between my thighs. Every tone he created curled 
                tantalizing fingers around my throbbing clitoris. I shifted in 
                my chair, my thighs falling apart so the music could find its 
                way more easily into my sex.</p>
              <p>Then it happened. The song ended, the sax player lowered his 
                gleaming brass instrument and looked around his wildly applauding 
                audience. His dark eyes lit on me. </p>
              <p>We stared at each other for a moment, and all seemed to go quiet. 
                He raised a smoothly curved eyebrow at me in question. The very 
                corners of my dark red mouth curved ever so slightly in response. 
                I felt galvanized, powerful, as if I had willed him to notice 
                me. His own mouth, full and wet from the sax, smiled back at me. 
                A devilish glint gleamed deep within his eyes. His gaze flicked 
                over me, measuring and judging every inch of my body. I was suddenly 
                vindicated by my choice of body-forming turtleneck. I could actually 
                feel the weight of his stare flicking over my breasts; my nipples 
                hardened and became clearly outlined by the thin cotton. His eyes 
                narrowed with appreciation and his smile took on an air of danger. 
                He suddenly looked hungry to me. That primal hunger struck an 
                answering chord within my sex, as surely as if he had played my 
                body tone for tone like his saxophone. </p>
              <p>I couldn't bear the waiting anymore; the temptation was too much 
                to stand. I stood suddenly, murmured some excuse to Samantha, 
                and made my way through the crowd. The sweating throng of closely 
                pressed bodies brushed and tantalized every heightened nerve ending 
                in my over-sexed body. I paused very much against my better senses, 
                rubbing my tingling breasts against the anonymous bodies I squeezed 
                between. A veritable orgy of faceless groping, bodies crushed 
                to bodies, hands possessing anything they could take. I was panting 
                by the time I reached the hall leading to the restrooms and the 
                manager's office. I closed my eyes and leaned against the wall, 
                wishing I had been bold enough to step onto that razor edged stage 
                and grab the sax player, as I had wanted to.</p>
              <p>A hand suddenly touched my side, squeezed my waist. My eyes flew 
                open. The saxophonist was standing before me just inches away, 
                staring hard at me with his burning, coal black eyes. He lowered 
                his handsome face, brushing my cheek with his. </p>
              <p>&quot;The manager's office is just down the hall,&quot; he murmured 
                against my ear, a deep baritone strumming the nerves along my 
                throat. </p>
              <p>I breathed deeply, taking in the heady scent of his aftershave. 
                He smelled like distilled sex to me, pure and crystalline as water. 
                And I was suddenly very thirsty. I nodded ever so slightly at 
                him, my gaze on his mouth. He brushed his full lips against mine, 
                grazed my mouth lightly with his smooth white teeth, making my 
                vision blur. Then he wrapped his arm around my waist and led me 
                down the hall.</p>
              <p>He closed the door behind us and switched on the wan light on 
                the desk. I'm a tall woman, but I felt dwarfed by him as he stood 
                between the light and myself. It made a halo of illumination around 
                his big, muscular body, tricking my perception into a fantasy 
                of demons and devils. I suddenly wished very much to be tempted. 
              </p>
              <p>He ran a broad finger along my collarbone, sending bolts of lightning 
                through my already sensitive body. I found I wasn't in the mood 
                for caresses and sensitivity, long drawn out foreplay. The exhilaration 
                of discovering a new body didn't appeal to me at the moment, much 
                to my surprise. I wanted to take the time to explore his body 
                at my leisure later, but right now I craved for something a little 
                more basic.</p>
              <p>I stepped forward and slid my hands up his broad chest to his 
                shoulders. I wrapped a hand around the base of his head and pulled 
                him down to me. My mouth took his, and I felt his surprise. Tongues 
                and teeth were brought into play, a possession of the other's 
                mouth. He took control quickly, slipping his hands around to cup 
                my ass and drag me hard against him. I felt his cock, long and 
                throbbing against my belly through our clothes. I let go of his 
                shoulder and pulled his shirt from his slacks. He leaned back 
                and drew the smooth silk shirt over his head. I assaulted his 
                belt next, ripping at it in my excitement. He tangled his fingers 
                in the band holding my hair and pulled it free. He took a fistful 
                of my hair and dragged my head back so he could savage my mouth 
                again. </p>
              <p>I went blind, sensation aroused by his mouth on mine detonating 
                behind my eyes. I dimly felt him tug upward on my turtleneck even 
                as I loosened his slacks and shoved them down. I slipped my burning 
                hands over his slick, sweat-sheened body, eyes closed, feeling 
                more than I could bear. The close, cigarette laced air, his heavy 
                cinnamon scented breathing against my face, the short hairs of 
                his chest brushing my arm as I reached down to cup him where he 
                was hardest. Perception froze then, as my hand made contact. He 
                was immense, hard and throbbing, straining against his silk boxers. 
                Unable to slow the sudden punch of greed to my belly, I dragged 
                the thin fabric over his lean hips. I stepped back, pulling away 
                from his mouth, wanting to see him.</p>
              <p>I stepped around the desk into the light, and he turned with 
                me until he was illuminated. It was like viewing a god carved 
                in dark wood. He was no mere sax player to me, but a well-defined 
                sculpture, art to be savoured, a representation of the species. 
                He was MAN, in its finest form. Wide shoulders curved over a broad, 
                firmly muscled chest. Short curling hairs dusted his coffee coloured 
                skin, tapering down to a thin line, an arrow pointing to his beautiful, 
                upthrust cock. He was long and thick, and the heart shaped head 
                gleamed under my scrutiny. </p>
              <p>He smiled at my obvious pleasure, and offered a broad hand out 
                to me. I stepped into his embrace, feeling those skilled fingers 
                skimming down my back to catch the ends of my turtleneck. He pulled 
                it from me in a smooth, single motion, and replaced the fabric 
                with his tongue, tasting every inch of me he had exposed. My skin 
                was hot and damp from excitement, and the fragrant air settled 
                along the light hairs to torment me. His magnificent mouth mapped 
                my shoulders, burning my flesh with his heat. A lightning storm 
                was building under my flesh, bolts dancing from nerve to nerve 
                whenever his teeth nipped me. I wanted badly to share that with 
                him, so I placed my palms on his smooth dark flesh. That alone 
                made the lava pool in my belly, the mere tactile sensation of 
                such fabulous bone and muscle under my hands. I pricked him again 
                and again with my nails, making him laugh low against my flesh.</p>
              <p>He covered my breasts with his hands. Rough, calloused fingers 
                catching on the navy satin, rasping along the lace edge. I arched 
                my back, pushing my breasts harder against his hands. He squeezed 
                and molded them in answer, thumbs scraping my nipples through 
                the satin. I unhooked my bra in back just as he lowered his mouth 
                to taste. He held the bra in place over the soft, heavy globes, 
                flicking his tongue along the edge of the lace and lowering the 
                fabric at his leisure. </p>
              <p>He still seemed intent on taking his time, and I was starving 
                for him. I wanted to feel all those hard, pulsing inches inside 
                me, his big muscled body above me. I reached down, dragging my 
                nails lightly across the sensitive ridges of his belly, following 
                the arrow line of hair to his proudly jutting cock. I brushed 
                the very tip with my thumbnail, slid my fingers along the burning 
                length. He pulled my bra completely from me as I ran my knuckles 
                down the veined underside of his length. I reached underneath 
                his sac and took his heavy balls in my hands as he sucked my nipples 
                into his hot, wet mouth. I rolled his balls in my palms, squeezing 
                and pricking him with my nails. He bit my nipple in response, 
                drawing a gasp from me. I shivered, grabbing his throbbing cock 
                in reflex to keep my world from spinning. </p>
              <p>My belt went next, my impatience spurring him to action. He dragged 
                my slacks down with little ceremony, and slid his hands into the 
                seat of my sheer panties, cupping my ass and pulling me against 
                his hips. The heat of his cock pressing against my belly was incredible. 
                He reached down into the thin scrap of material covering my mound, 
                then slipped his skilled fingers further down. I leaned my head 
                back, giving him a chance to bite and tongue his way along my 
                jaw while his fingers made their own foray along my slit. The 
                tip of one finger parted the folds, dipped inside to run along 
                my core, slick with my cream. He paused just at the edge of my 
                gate, and kept going, feeling his way to the throbbing pearl of 
                my clit. I pulled at his cock, dragging it up and against my smooth 
                belly, asking him without words to hurry.</p>
              <p>He pressed his finger against my clit once, and drew his hand 
                out from beneath the satin. He took my panties in his big hands 
                and tore, shredding them from my body in one move. I shivered 
                in delight and turned my face up to his, kissing him hard to show 
                my approval. He covered my mound with one hand, pushing up against 
                my public bone, crushing my trapped clit against my own slick 
                flesh. I moaned into his mouth. He wrapped his free arm around 
                my waist, pulling me down in counterpoint to his other hand. He 
                rocked my body into his palm, slipping his centre finger into 
                my folds and dancing it around my entrance. I rode his hand at 
                his pace, grinding my crotch into his palm. He started dragging 
                me higher, bringing me to my toes to keep the delicious friction. 
                I was panting into his mouth, sliding my hand over his cock in 
                time to the thrusts of my starving body. I whimpered once, just 
                as I was about to come, and he lowered me, pulled his hand away. 
              </p>
              <p>I looked at him through glazed eyes, and saw him go down to the 
                floor. He grabbed my hips and nudged my ankles apart with his 
                knees. I felt his breath teasing along my slit. He pressed his 
                mouth against me, pulling me apart with his wide, wet tongue. 
                He flicked it over my creamy flesh, killing me slowly, drawing 
                and mapping the edges of my eager pussy. I grabbed his shoulders 
                as he licked his way up to my clit, and I pressed my crotch more 
                firmly against his mouth. He sucked my pearl once, maddening my 
                over sensitive body, then closed his teeth over it. Lightning 
                crackled behind my closed eyes and I came into his mouth with 
                a cry. </p>
              <p>He stood, grinning at me. He grabbed my hips and picked me up, 
                sliding me up his body. I clutched at his shoulders, still shimmering 
                through my first climax. I wrapped my legs around his waist as 
                he dragged me up, that throbbing monster feeling its own way through 
                my wet passage. The rounded head slid easily into my slit, and 
                he rubbed the length of his cock between my thighs. I kissed him 
                again, tasting my cream on his tongue, and he pulled my body back 
                far enough for the head of his cock to enter me. I groaned, trying 
                to hurry him by pulling on his waist with my ankles, but his strength 
                was incredible. He slid slowly up my channel, filling and stretching 
                me deliciously. I moaned into his mouth, pulling against him, 
                wanting it all. He suddenly bucked under me, thrusting upward 
                with all his strength, filling me to my core. I whimpered at the 
                brilliance of the sensation, feeling him in my throat. He cupped 
                my ass in his hands and began to thrust.</p>
              <p>I tore my mouth from his and bit along his jaw to his shoulder, 
                maintaining my hold on his shoulders with my nails. I ground my 
                crotch into his every time he was fully sheathed, rubbing my throbbing 
                clit against his curved, burning cock. He bucked and pounded into 
                me, driving me insane, making me want to scream as he tunneled 
                inside me. I tightened my legs around him to shorten his strokes 
                as I neared the end, but the power of his forearms was too great 
                and he thrust hard and fast into my wet heat. I sank my teeth 
                into his full lower lip, wanting him to slow down and make it 
                last, but he was intent on making me take that fast and furious 
                fall. He laughed low in response to my savagery and kissed my 
                hard, pushing his tongue deep within my mouth. I moaned and sucked 
                on him, clutching his cock with my nether lips as I came again. 
              </p>
              <p>He slowed, giving me time to recover, then began rocking into 
                me again. Still tingling, I determined that he should be the next 
                to lose control. I slid my arms down his back and clawed at his 
                muscular cheeks. He groaned softly into my mouth and bucked harder 
                against me. I tore my mouth from his and leaned my head back, 
                looking into his glittering ebony eyes. I grinned at him, feeling 
                the power of his thrusts dragging me back up that jagged cliff 
                again. </p>
              <p>&quot;Together,&quot; I whispered against his mouth.</p>
              <p>&quot;Together,&quot; he agreed in that rum-on-velvet baritone 
                that vibrated through his chest into mine. </p>
              <p>I sank my teeth into his lower lip again. He took a step forward, 
                and pressed me hard into the office door. He held me there, imprisoned 
                by his body. He pounded into me, breathing hard, bring up his 
                hands to squeeze and mold my breasts. He kissed me hard, tunneling 
                into my wet, pulsing flesh. I felt my muscles tightening again, 
                clutching at his cock. He was growing inside me, getting harder, 
                and his balls were drawing up against me when he was fully sheathed. 
                His thrusts became wild, he pistoned determinedly into my welcoming 
                body. </p>
              <p>&quot;Now,&quot; he growled against my ear. He slid his hand 
                around and into the crease where our bodies were joined. He massaged 
                my clit roughly, pushing it back into my pubic bone in time with 
                his thrusts. I pressed my face into the muscle of his shoulder, 
                moaning against his flesh while he pumped repeatedly into me. 
                He squeezed my throbbing breasts reflexively, panting into my 
                jumbled hair. I looked down when he cried out and jetted into 
                me, having to see where we were joined, the brilliant contrast 
                of his coffee coloured cock sliding into my creamy, wet folds. 
                The image was more than I could bear, deliciously flaunting years 
                of social taboo. I clutched hard at his back, my climax meeting 
                and melding with his. </p>
              <p>He kissed me again, one last kiss beyond any need for kissing. 
                We stayed against the door for a short while, relearning the complex 
                process of breathing properly. He finally gave a shuddering sigh, 
                his cheek pressed into my hair. He took a small step back, letting 
                me lower my legs. He stood still for a moment, while I adjusted 
                my tingling, shaking muscles to bear my weight. He slipped from 
                inside me, leaving me bereft and empty. I shivered, the front 
                of my body gone cold without his heat against me. We dressed in 
                silence, handing each other whichever article of clothing was 
                closest. Finally, he buckled his smooth leather belt while I finger-combed 
                my pale hair back, banding it again. He looked at me with those 
                quiet, intense dark eyes. I sighed then, and reached for the doorknob. 
                His hand met mine, covered it, dwarfing me with his size. A delicious 
                bolt of fiery electricity shot through my body, pooling in my 
                quaking belly. He stepped closer, now just an inch away from me. 
                I tilted my head back to look at him.</p>
              <p>&quot;I'm off work in an hour,&quot; he said quietly, a rumble 
                of stones on sand in the stillness.</p>
              <p>I smiled, heat filling every inch of my body. &quot;I'll wait 
                for you,&quot; I replied. He grinned back down at me, and slid 
                his arm around my waist, dragging me against him for a hard kiss, 
                which would have to last us both for another hour at least. </p>
              <p>We went back out into the lively noise of chatter and clinks 
                of bottles meeting glasses. He left me at my table with Samantha 
                and went back down to reclaim his meager sliver of stage. I sat 
                contented then, shimmering, as he made love to the audience with 
                the soul-stirring notes from his sax, waiting for it to again 
                be my turn. </p>
