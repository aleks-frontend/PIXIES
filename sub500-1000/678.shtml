              <p>The new neighbors seemed an odd couple, he a big angry flannel 
                shirted grump, and she a homely unhappy victim type who always 
                looked down at the ground as she followed a few paces behind him 
                from the car to the house. I watched them move in and heard him 
                yell at her to carry this or that. She said nothing as she did 
                his bidding. It was difficult for me to knock on their door and 
                welcome them to the neighborhood because I didn't like this guy 
                from the get go and have little sympathy for the victim wife, 
                but my house is 8 feet from theirs and a little higher, so my 
                windows look down into their house, so meeting them was inevitable. 
              </p>
              <p>I knocked &amp; heard him yell at her to get off her ass and answer 
          the door. She answered wearing a thin cotton housedress that buttoned 
          down the front. I had some interest about what was underneath the dress, 
          but couldn't get past her uneasiness as she stood there looking down 
          at the ground and not at me. She whimpered out a quiet hello, and I 
          introduced myself. She held out a limp hand to shake and invited me 
          in. Bob came in quickly from the kitchen and shook my hand and was glad 
          to meet me and offered me a beer. I don't drink, so I insulted him with 
          a &quot;no thanks&quot;. He informed me that if I was too damn good 
          to drink with him then I was to get out right now. I left quickly&#133;</p>
        <p> Over the next few weeks I saw them a few times, and it seemed that 
          when he wasn't around I might have seen the start of a smile on her 
          face. One day I was washing the windows and noticed that their back 
          door, which opened into their laundry room, was wide open and rock music 
          was coming out. I continued to wash the windows, which afforded me of 
          a complete view of their laundry room. She (I still call her &quot;she&quot; 
          because I never found out her name) anyway, she entered the room carrying 
          a laundry basket and stared loading up the washer. I couldn't tell if 
          she noticed me there 8 feet away or not, but she was moving to the music 
          and taking her time loading the washer one piece at a time. I was glad 
          to see that this woman enjoyed some part of her life. I began to take 
          notice to the naughty little lacy pieces of negligee she was loading 
          up. She held up and examined each piece and playfully dropped them one 
          by one in to the washer as she swayed to the music. I began to feel 
          awkward standing there mesmerized by my neighbor so I opened the window 
          and called out &quot;Hello&quot;. She paused briefly, but turned only 
          slightly my way. I could not tell if she saw me or not, but I'm sure 
          she heard me, so I no longer felt guilty staring at this quickly blossoming 
          flower.</p>
        <p>I watched her pick up a thong, a see through panty, bra set and many 
          more tasty items and examine each piece while swaying to the music, 
          then drop them playfully into the washer. I think I saw her check to 
          see if I was still watching as she slowly unbuttoned her dress as her 
          slow swaying turned to sexy bump &amp; grind. She slowly removed her 
          dress while dancing like a stripper, then she continued to dance around 
          in her bikini underwear and her see through lace bra while she was still 
          loading the washer. She turned away from me and bent way over to get 
          each piece now with her fine looking ass and thinly covered patch offered 
          for my attention. As she was bent over, ass proudly displayed for me 
          to see, I saw her peak back through her legs to make sure I was still 
          watching and she reached up and slid her panties down affording me a 
          full view of her pussy lips. She rubbed her panties over her pussy and 
          stood facing me as she removed her bra and through them both into the 
          machine.<br>
          Just then she sat back into the laundry basket spreading her legs. She 
          licked her finger and started to masturbate. I could take it no longer 
          and I freed my now fully erect cock and masturbated right along with 
          her. There I was 8 feet from her and both of us were masturbating and 
          still she hadn't acknowledged my presence. I shot my load right on to 
          the window that I had just washed and she screamed YES, YES, YES, I'M 
          CUMMING, I'M CUMMING. She turned her head to look at me and said &quot;thank 
          you&quot; as she pranced her way out of the laundry room.</p>
        <p>I'm thinking about bringing over a welcome basket. </p>
