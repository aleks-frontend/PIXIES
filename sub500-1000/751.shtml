<p> As Jules sat in the bar that night, in his usual seat against 
                the wall, he couldn&#8217;t help feeling that nothing had changed 
                in his life. That the world was caught in some eternal loop where 
                no matter what he did during the course of his days, his life 
                would always be this way. He had no reason to feel this way in 
                particular today, no event had taken place that had given him 
                cause to feel this glum, but that was exactly the point. He was 
                starting to understand the real meaning of boredom. He felt neither 
                happy nor sad, but rather numb, and this numbness was in turn 
                making him miserable, as though his body and mind were so in need 
                of a sensation, that the sensation of misery was preferable to 
                that of nothingness.<p>
                He hardly noticed the new waitress walk over to his table, and 
                it was only when he caught the sound of her low voice with the 
                Spanish accent that he looked up at her, into her eyes. She didn&#8217;t 
                bother to smile at him, for she could see that it wouldn&#8217;t 
                be returned but she continued to speak to him. At first he didn&#8217;t 
                even listen to what she was saying, just the mellow sound of her 
                voice, but he suddenly became aware that she was asking him a 
                question from the intonation of those heavily accented words and 
                the pause which followed. &#8220;Uh, yes sure!&#8221; he replied 
                assuming she had asked him if he wanted the same again. &#8220;Ok, 
                my shift finishes in half an hour, meet me on the corner where 
                my boss won&#8217;t see us&#8221; - her response stopped him dead. 
                He&#8217;d just made a date with this girl without even knowing 
                what he was doing. He looked at her again and for the first time 
                noticed what she looked like as she walked to the bar with his 
                empty glass on her tray. She had a mass of dark curls and was 
                slender and cat-like as she slipped behind the bar &#8211; her 
                eyes flashed as she stared right at him for a second too long 
                before disappearing into the kitchens. Jules would not normally 
                have kept a date with some stranger but at least this was a sensation 
                other than boredom &#8211; this was fear. . . <p>
                They met at the corner and her ease impressed him. She was not 
                forceful, but sure of herself, aware that she was the sexiest 
                woman he had been near in a very long time. Her lack of nerves 
                made him comfortable and she talked about how miserable he had 
                been looking in the bar and that she had a talent for making men 
                feel better. They walked with purpose even though he had no idea 
                where they were going until she stopped abruptly outside an apartment 
                block. &#8220;This is where I live. Come up.&#8221; She didn&#8217;t 
                invite him, she told him and he liked her for not using euphemisms 
                or playing games with him. She didn&#8217;t invite him for coffee 
                she just told him to come upstairs with her. He had a sneaking 
                idea what she had in mind and she wasn&#8217;t bothered that he 
                knew. Upstairs, she sat him down in the armchair in her living 
                room and took off her coat. She reached over and unbuttoned his 
                shirt and pulled it open as he sat there wordless and tense. She 
                told him that tension was a bad thing and that when she had seen 
                him in the bar, all she&#8217;d wanted to do was relax him - that 
                was her gift. She reached over and kissed along his jaw line and 
                then planted her full mouth over his. Gently sucking his tongue 
                into her mouth and caressing it with just enough pressure to be 
                insistent, but not enough for him to feel as though she was dominating 
                him. Somehow she knew how to be passive but without making him 
                feel as though he was in control. She drove him to kiss her with 
                the force and passion of a man, but he did not feel that familiar 
                anxiety which so often comes with being the dominant force in 
                a sexual encounter. The kiss finally ended &#8211; just one, long 
                firm definitive kiss and then she moved to his neck, making him 
                rest his head back in the chair. Her mouth traced the outline 
                of his collarbone as she knelt in front of his chair and her hands 
                rested, one on each of his thighs. Normally he would have felt 
                nervous and his thighs would have trembled beneath her hands, 
                but she was right when she said she had a way of relaxing people. 
                He was at ease because he knew that this was about nothing more 
                than sex and that she wasn&#8217;t doing it for any reason other 
                than because she wanted to. Her lips traveled down to his nipples 
                and she looked up to see him gazing at her. He wanted her clothes 
                off and she sensed this, peeling her blouse off to reveal beautiful 
                coffee breasts and expensive underwear. He felt the lace and the 
                warm globes of her flesh against his abdomen as she returned to 
                flick her tongue over his nipples and he took a deep breath and 
                closed his eyes as though he were receiving a massage - passive 
                enjoyment of this woman&#8217;s talent. She reached his belt, 
                unbuckled, unzipped and slid down his trousers, taking his underwear 
                at the same time. Her attention thus far had almost been too soothing 
                to be erotic and he wasn&#8217;t totally hard yet. The tension 
                was drained from his body and even his cock was too relaxed to 
                be straining against her as she licked the join of his thighs 
                to his groin, each side in turn. She cupped his balls in her cool 
                hands and the first real flicker of lust ran through him, teasing 
                him slightly, but not unbearably. Her delicate tongue licked the 
                base of his cock making him fully hard as she continued to touch 
                his balls lightly, but without tickling him and he issued a guttural 
                moan from his throat. Her tongue moved over his balls, as she 
                traced her fingers down to his buttocks stroked a finger between 
                them making his cock jerk slightly from the pleasure of being 
                touched there so expertly. She stopped briefly to unhook her bra 
                and allow her breasts to weigh down on his naked thighs as she 
                licked lower down, tracing one long lick from his backside, up 
                over his balls to the base of his cock. She repeated the movement 
                a couple more times, not touching the shaft of his cock, until 
                he started to pump his hips, wanting her to take all of him into 
                her mouth and suck and suck. She licked up the shaft of his cock 
                with her tiny pointed tongue, once, twice, three times, until 
                she had taken one long delicious stroke up each side of his penis, 
                each time, stopping just short of the very sensitive tip. His 
                body was shuddering by now and his cock glistened with the pre-cum, 
                which was flowing from his excitement. She glanced up at him as 
                he gazed down at her and smiled slightly before oh-so-gently licking 
                the pre-cum from the very sensitive tip. She paused a split second, 
                to tease him and then continued with slow tantalizing licks, all 
                over the tip of his penis until his balls where so tight he wanted 
                to explode, but knowing that he wouldn&#8217;t until he was engulfed 
                in her hot mouth. She reached down and caressed his balls as she 
                continued to lick the very tip of him, as though to soothe and 
                massage them as they ached from pleasure and need. She placed 
                one cool finger at the opening of his backside and pressed gently 
                in little circles as her licking became firmer and wetter. He 
                continued to moan in the exquisite agony of being teased by this 
                fantastic woman. Never had he known a woman to be so good at giving 
                pleasure in this way and he was all of a sudden amazed by her 
                and turned on, not only by what she was doing but by the whole 
                of her &#8211; by the idea that a woman like this was walking 
                around on the same planet as him. He began to pump his hips harder 
                and in doing so her finger traveled further into him, increasing 
                his desire to explode into her mouth, but still she licked his 
                cock with just the very tip of her tongue. He felt as though he 
                may come from the feeling of her finger inside him and the tip 
                of her tongue on the head of his cock and he willed her to let 
                him have the satisfaction of her hot mouth around him as he flooded 
                her throat. Again, she seemed to sense when he couldn&#8217;t 
                take the pleasure any longer and slowly she pressed her lips against 
                the tip of his cock and engulfed it in her mouth, so that he felt 
                like he was entering the tightest pussy he had ever experienced. 
                She took the length of his cock in her beautiful hot mouth and 
                he played with the tumble of curls on her head as he watched her 
                head raise up, sucking ever so slightly on his silken shaft. He 
                felt the air cool his wet cock as she drew away from him, before 
                sinking slowly back down on it. She moved her wet warm, velvet 
                mouth slowly up and down the shaft as her hands continued to massage 
                his balls and that fantastic finger pressed against him, bringing 
                him ever closer to his climax. His moans grew louder as he became 
                unable to control the pleasure and as he managed to open his eyes 
                for a split second, he noticed that her hips were swaying with 
                her own arousal as she listened to the sound of his pleasure. 
                He reached a hand to her beautiful breast, almost afraid to touch 
                them for fear that he would come from the pleasure of feeling 
                the firm globes and the hard pink nipples. She was so obviously 
                aroused by the pleasure she was giving and he slid his hand up 
                her skirt and under her panties to feel how wet she was. She groaned, 
                with her mouth still full of his bulging cock as he touched her 
                soaking wet pussy which had drenched her soft pubic hair and suddenly 
                he realised how much he wanted to return the pleasure he was feeling. 
                The sensation of her hot mouth around him seemed to get better 
                and better, so that even when he thought he could not feel anymore 
                pleasure without squirting his cum into her throat, it seemed 
                to feel ever more delicious. Until now her mouth had been moving 
                up and down him, with only the smallest pressure, but now she 
                began to suck him harder and harder at the same time as moving 
                up and down the length of his shaft. He no longer needed to pump 
                his hips, for she was giving him that wonderful feeling of a totally 
                satisfying sensation, moving up and down him, increasing the speed 
                with each downward motion and increasing the pressure with which 
                she sucked with each upward motion. She continued this for what 
                seemed like a century until she was sucking hard and fast and 
                his eyes were screwed up tightly with the ecstatic feeling in 
                his groin. She lifter her mouth from him for the briefest moment 
                to speak for the first time since she had begun to work her magic 
                and in her husky Spanish accent said simply, &#8220;You&#8217;re 
                going to come for me now&#8221;. She sucked him back into her 
                mouth pushing her finger a little further inside him until he 
                could bare it no longer. He cried out &#8220;Oh God! You&#8217;re 
                making me come. I&#8217;m coming, I&#8217;m ohhhh&#8221; as he 
                felt the red hot cum from his balls travel the length of the shaft 
                of his cock and felt he release of the pressure as his fluid jerked 
                in several spasms from the tip of his cock. Her wet velvet tongue 
                swirled around it in her mouth and his cock was vibrated by her 
                mouth as she moaned in the delight of his orgasm. She had swallowed 
                the first few mouthfuls of his cum before he had finished spurting 
                the last few into her mouth and as his cock softened in her mouth 
                she continued to suck and throb around him, prolonging his orgasm, 
                &#8220;oh God, oh fuck!&#8221; he gasped in amazement &#8220;I&#8217;m 
                gonna come &#8211; I&#8217;m still coming, I&#8217;m . . .&#8221; 
                and his cock spurted more cum into her eager mouth, even after 
                he thought he had finished his orgasm. This is what it must feel 
                like for a woman to have multiple orgasms, he though as he finally 
                emptied himself fully into her mouth watching as one single stream 
                of cum ran down the side of her mouth. She made no attempt to 
                stop it and it ran down her chin on to her breast. Even after 
                this woman had made him come, she still seemed able to turn him 
                on by her powerful yet unthreatening sexuality, and his mind was 
                already full of thoughts about what they could do later that night, 
                or in the morning. As his breathing returned to normal, she finally 
                took her mouth away from him, kissed his soft cock and moved up 
                to sit on the arm of the chair, pressing his head to her breast 
                and stroking his hair. He opened his eyes and glanced at the clock 
                on her wall. It was late and he was tired - she had spent over 
                an hour and half just seeing to his pleasure and he felt a pang 
                of guilt as he thought about how he should be pleasuring her. 
                He tried to apologise for his sleepiness, but she just pushed 
                his head closer to her breast, so that he was nursing on her nipple 
                and soothed him once more with her voice, &#8220;The morning, 
                my love. I shall take my pleasure in the morning . . . .&#8221;<p>
