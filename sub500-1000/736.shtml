              <p>Michelle Hopkins<p>
                It was a warm sultry summer night. She had just walked down the 
                street from work to the local tavern for a cold one before going 
                home alone again .The bar was dark and stale from the smell of 
                stale cigarettes. Miranda sat down at the nearest stool. Finally, 
                about ten minutes later the bartender noticed her. &#8220;Can 
                I get you something?&#8221; he asked. Miranda nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;ll 
                have a Margarita.&#8221; Suddenly she noticed a tall, dark, tan 
                muscular man at the end of the bar staring at her. At first she 
                felt uneasy. As Miranda sipped her drink, then another, she became 
                less aware of his presence. It had been a very trying day at work 
                and she was stressed to the limit. Not being much of a drinker, 
                the drinks soon started taking effect. Feeling a little more at 
                home, she sauntered over to the pool table. &#8220;Anyone of you 
                gents up for a good game with me&#8221;, she asked. Immediately 
                she had several offers. Being in her mid thirties, no longer looking 
                like a nineteen year old but not bad for her age either, she looked 
                hot in her black mini dress and red silk blouse. She decided to 
                play partners with a young looking man. She guessed him to be 
                no more than twenty-three. The first game was won with no problem. 
                She continued to sip drink after drink. Miranda hadn&#8217;t noticed 
                that one of her opponents had left the table and now she was playing 
                against the dark haired man she&#8217;d noticed earlier at the 
                bar. The two teams played game after game until finally the young 
                man she was teamed with and the blonde gentleman from the other 
                team said it was time for them to cut out. Now she was left alone 
                to play against this man who had been staring at her. Some time 
                after the two guys left, he said &#8220;I noticed you at the bar 
                tonight&#8221;. &#8220;Are you adventurous?&#8221; the man asked. 
                Miranda more than half drunk from the Margaritas said, &#8220;I 
                can be sometimes, I haven&#8217;t had much opportunity to be lately.&#8221; 
                He simply said&#8221;, Maybe we can change all that tonight.&#8221; 
                with a snide look on his face. At first Miranda was hesitant. 
                &#8220;I don&#8217;t even know your name.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Just 
                call me Ace.&#8221; Miranda chucked at this. She didn&#8217;t 
                know why but his name had struck her funny. It was nearly two 
                a.m. The bar was nearing closing time. Ace said, why don&#8217;t 
                we get out of here for a while. Miranda dreading the idea of another 
                lonely night at home alone readily agreed. It had been only a 
                year since she divorced her husband of twelve years. He had been 
                the love of her life, but she couldn&#8217;t take the fighting 
                anymore. Enough was enough. She was so used to having someone 
                there. Even the occasional touch was better than nothing at all. 
                All her life she had never been alone until recently. Miranda 
                was not in the habit of going out with strangers. Somehow her 
                loneliness had taken over for common sense. They exited the bar 
                and headed for his truck. It was a black truck with the windows 
                tinted completely black as well. This made him even more intriguing 
                to her. Miranda had never been the bad girl type. All her life 
                was focused around family and morals. She had gone from high school 
                to living with her boyfriend then on to marriage and children. 
                Now she was discovering herself for the first time. It had been 
                hard for her to go to work after being a wife and mother for so 
                long. It was even worse when the night came. She had never really 
                had to be alone. The girls at work had been on her and telling 
                her to take a chance and try to meet new people. They kept telling 
                her not all guys were like her ex. Stacy at work told her to be 
                more adventurous and take a chance. She wanted to take Miranda 
                to a bar she liked to frequent but Miranda graciously refused. 
                Now, here she was, with a total stranger. Something she had never 
                imagined herself doing. They climbed into his truck, Miranda needing 
                a little help as the steps were so high. As the doors slammed 
                shut, apprehension took over her body. Was she sure she wanted 
                to do this? It was too late for second thoughts now as the truck 
                slowly pulled from the lot. Nervously she asked where are we heading. 
                Ace just smiled that mischievous smile at her. Miranda, trying 
                to get something more out of him during the ride kept trying to 
                make small talk. All he would do was smile. They drove for what 
                seemed like hours. Finally, she noticed a small dirt driveway 
                that looked like it led to nowhere. She hadn&#8217;t been paying 
                attention up to this point so she had no idea where they were. 
                After driving about half a mile up the dark stone drive, they 
                came to a log cabin in the woods. Ace put the truck in park and 
                said now we can get out.<p>
                After he had climbed out of the truck, he came around to help 
                her down. &#8220;Where are we?&#8221; she asked. He just grinned 
                and said heaven. They walked slowly into the cabin, Miranda a 
                few steps behind him as she was apprehensive. Here she was, miles 
                away from anyone or anything. She had no idea where she was, who 
                this person was or what he would do to her. Inside the rustic 
                cabin, Ace offered her another drink. Miranda said no thanks. 
                I think I&#8217;ve had enough. Ace was persistent. I thought you 
                wanted to be adventurous. With that comment, Miranda accepted 
                his offer. He started a fire in the fireplace. It made it a little 
                cozier. They sat on a rug in front of the fireplace saying nothing 
                at all. It was starting to get hot. Between the summer heat, the 
                drinks and the fire, Miranda was feeling extremely warm. The sweat 
                trickled down Miranda&#8217;s neck to her breasts. The feeling 
                tickled a bit and her nipples perked up. They showed through the 
                red silk blouse like she was wearing nothing. Ace pretended not 
                to notice, the whole time glancing down his gaze upon them. Miranda 
                lost count. How many drinks had she had? Oh well, it didn&#8217;t 
                matter at this point. She knew she was beyond helping herself 
                if things got too heated anyway. Ace told her to relax. He gently 
                rubbed the back of her neck with an ice cube. She slipped her 
                stilettos off and leaned back into his touch. She knew she was 
                loosing herself in the time and in the moment. The fire crackled 
                and her skin was hot under his touch. Even with the ice. He slowly 
                started to unbutton her blouse. At first she raised her hand in 
                protest but his firm strong hands pushed hers aside. Who was this 
                man who was so sure of himself and his touches? Her head spun 
                with the drinks and the intensity of his touches. He only had 
                one button left to undo. There, it was done. Now her breasts were 
                exposed, covered only by a thin white bra. He continued to move 
                the ice across her chest. Droplets of water rolling down over 
                her nipples made them even harder. He gently yet firmly removed 
                her blouse. Now he was getting more aggressive. He demanded she 
                remove her bra and exposed herself the rest of the way. Miranda 
                was somewhat shy and said she couldn&#8217;t. With that, he tore 
                the bra away and her full round plump breasts popped out. Next 
                he told her to remove her pantyhose. Wanting to avoid a repeat 
                performance, she reluctantly agreed. Now Miranda was partially 
                exposed. She was on the floor with only her skirt and panties 
                on. Ace stood up and disappeared for a few minutes. Miranda looked 
                around for a phone to call for help but there was none. She couldn&#8217;t 
                even run away. She looked out of the window and saw they were 
                in the middle of nowhere with cliffs outside of the cabin on one 
                side. Just then, ace returned. He grinned. He knew she was his 
                .He pushed her back down to the floor. &#8220;Please, just don&#8217;t 
                hurt me.&#8221; she begged. He didn&#8217;t reply. He came close 
                to her, grabbing her breasts with more firmness than before. Suddenly, 
                she felt a stinging pain on her nipples. He put nipples clamps 
                on them. She started to cry. Ace slowly crept around her and started 
                to lick her navel. She was afraid and yet aroused at the same 
                time. She could feel the wetness growing in her panties and the 
                pain in her nipples was subsiding. Her head was reeling from the 
                mixed signals to her brain of both pain and pleasure. Ace grabbed 
                some rope he&#8217;d brought back. He tied her hands firmly enough 
                that she couldn&#8217;t get out but not so tight as to hurt. Next 
                he blindfolded her. The fear came back and washed over her. He 
                scooped her up in his strong arms and carried her somewhere in 
                the cabin. She could hear a door open and shut behind her. Now 
                she could feel herself being laid down on something hard and cold. 
                It had to be some kind of table. He pulled her bound hands above 
                her head and tied them to whatever it was she was lying on. She 
                started to cry again. This time, he put a gag on her mouth. She 
                can feel his hands moving down her legs and back to her waist. 
                She tries to squirm away from his touch. Suddenly, he pulls her 
                skirt off in one swift motion. Only her g-string remains .She 
                tries to scream but it is in vain. No one can hear her. Between 
                the gag and the location, she knows it is futile. Almost immediately, 
                she feels him yank her legs apart. Is she going to be raped? First 
                he ties one leg, then the other. They are wide apart. Miranda 
                feels the table give way under her and there is no more table 
                under her bottom. It feels like it broke apart. Now Miranda is 
                tied up with her legs apart her bottom hanging in suspension and 
                only a g-string separating her most personal places from whatever 
                intrusion Ace decided for her fate.<p>
                She can feel tugging at the clamps on her breasts. It feels like 
                they are being lifted up high above her. Now realizing they too 
                are being lifted in the air by chains on the clamps she panics. 
                Ace comes between her legs and cuts the small panties away with 
                one swipe. She is now completely exposed and his for the taking. 
                Ace knew she was scared but he also knew she was a woman with 
                deep desires and he wanted to fulfill them. Even the deepest darkest 
                desires one could imagine. Ace took a candle from its holder and 
                lit it. Slowly he dripped the warm wax all over her breasts. She 
                wriggled. He goes to his little box of delights and finds a surprise 
                for her. From within the box, he pulls out a bottle of baby oil. 
                It is already warm from the temperature of the house. Next, he 
                pours it gingerly over her clean shaven mound. He slowly massages 
                it in as he drips more. Miranda is still afraid but now highly 
                aroused too .She is moaning now as he touches her most intimate 
                parts. She can feel his long thick fingers rubbing over her clitoris, 
                down across her vagina, even back to her anus. He feels so good. 
                It&#8217;s been such a long time. Now that she is nice and slippery, 
                he grabs a small anal probe. He slowly inserts it in her anus, 
                a little at a time. It goes in a little, he gently pushes harder, 
                a little further to go to get past the bulb and anchor it securely 
                in her rectum. It is in now. He decides to pick out another toy. 
                This one is a metal dildo about eight inches long and two inches 
                around. He rubs it over her clit and slides it over her opening. 
                He slowly pushes just the tip in and pulls it back out only to 
                rub it over her clit again. With each stroke over her clit and 
                into her vagina, he pushes it in a little deeper. With this stroke 
                he will push it all the way in. She feels so full and tight with 
                the plug in her butt and the dildo in her opening. Ace just lets 
                her adjust to the sizes inside her for a moment or two. He now 
                takes out the dildo and then the plug. She has mixed feelings 
                of both relief and longing. She tries to utter something to Ace 
                but she can&#8217;t be heard. Now he can see the desire in her 
                body. He slides his hands over her vagina, gently opening the 
                labia. First he slips in one finger and he can feel her tighten 
                under his touch. He is enjoying this. Nothing is better than the 
                feeling of being in control of your lovers emotions during sex. 
                He loves the feel of her squirming under his touch. He slips in 
                a second finger. It slides in with little effort as she is stretched 
                a little from the dildo. Now he pushes in a third and forth. It 
                feels like a warm velvety blanket wrapping around his fingers. 
                It is so hot and so moist. Ace wants to explore further. He slides 
                his fingers from her pouting opening and slowly eases his way 
                towards her rear opening. Now he slips in a finger there. Miranda, 
                already hot with passion moans. He knows she is enjoying this. 
                This only makes him hotter and more engrossed in his endeavor. 
                He goes for two fingers in her rear. They enter with ease from 
                the previous plug. Now she is really wriggling around. With his 
                other hand, he puts pressure on her clit. The whole time she is 
                wriggling, it is making the chains on her nipples tug at them 
                a little harder. All of the sensations and emotions have her in 
                a daze. The third finger goes in with a little more effort than 
                the others. His own erection is no longer hidden. He gives his 
                own member a stroke. Now he is becoming intoxicated with desire, 
                so much so he pushes a forth finger in without thinking. This 
                snaps both Miranda and Ace to reality as she stiffens with pain. 
                He quietly mumbles he&#8217;s sorry. Ace maneuvers to her head 
                where he removes the gag. He rubs his growing erection over her 
                lips and she tries to catch it in her mouth. He will not let her. 
                Not yet. Suddenly the room is completely still. He has left the 
                room for something. A few minutes later she can hear footsteps. 
                It&#8217;s not just his footsteps though. She can hear other footsteps 
                but they are strange to her. They sound odd. She feels something 
                cold and wet between her legs and then a hot rough tongue lapping 
                at her crotch. It feels like sandpaper but at the same time it&#8217;s 
                turning her on all over again. What can it be? She&#8217;s lost 
                in the moment. The licking stops and she feels something sharp 
                on her thighs and something huge suddenly invades her rear orifice. 
                She feels it pushing deeper and then a popping feeling. It&#8217;s 
                sliding in and out quickly yet she can feel it growing ever larger 
                inside her, the whole time the digging in her legs still there. 
                She can feel trickles of blood warm and sticky running down her 
                leg where the scratches are. Now Miranda can feel fingers probing 
                at her womanhood. Without hesitation, Ace rams four fingers into 
                Miranda&#8217;s hot wanting vagina. Again, she stiffens for a 
                minute to adjust to the new feelings flooding over her body. She 
                can feel the fingers pushing in and out deeper and deeper and 
                the rhythmic strokes in her back door. Ace drives his entire hand 
                into her tiny vagina. She explodes in pain. As she lets it sink 
                in, the pain slowly turns to a heightened state of ecstasy. Now 
                just as abruptly as the intruder entered her rear, she can feel 
                it being yanked out. It tears her a little and she hears a yelp. 
                With the sound, she realizes it was a dog and with the size of 
                its member, it had to be a big one. The footsteps of the dog decrease 
                as it leaves the room. The dog&#8217;s tool is now replaced by 
                an even larger tool. It has to be Ace, Miranda realizes. Now Ace 
                is between her legs, pumping her vagina with his full hand in 
                her and ramming her anus with his own giant tool. She figured 
                it had to be at least three inches around and eleven inches long. 
                He felt huge in her. Ace strokes her anus with a few forceful 
                strokes and then withdrawals. Now he maneuvers his penis around 
                to Miranda&#8217;s waiting mouth. Now she may suck him. She is 
                hesitant at first but as he continues to batter her vagina with 
                his fist, she is driven closer to the edge of orgasm and swallows 
                him up in her hot mouth. She is allowed to suck him for about 
                ten minutes. Now he again pulls his tool from her mouth and returns 
                to her lower body. As he repositions himself near her bottom, 
                he puts four fingers from his other hand in her rectum. She feels 
                so full. How can this be humanly possible? There is a huge hand 
                in the front and now more in the back. How can she survive this 
                abuse? Will her body ever be the same? She is afraid and so hot 
                at the same time. Now he is working carefully and masterfully 
                on both openings. He stops moving the hand in the front and keeps 
                it completely still while with his other hand, he tucks in his 
                thumb and slowly pushes his whole hand forward again. He can&#8217;t 
                fit it in. Ace removes his hand from the front and concentrates 
                entirely on the rear. After several attempts, he leans his weight 
                into it and it slides in with a pop. Miranda winces in pain. Ace 
                holds completely still for a few minutes to allow her to adjust 
                to the new sensations she is experiencing. Eventually the pain 
                dissipates and is replaced by pleasure. Now he begins the slow 
                task of moving in and out just a little at a time. He slowly works 
                up faster and deeper. At first his hand was only in to the wrist. 
                Now he has worked it up to the forearm and still pushing his way 
                further into the bowels of her soul. The feelings are indescribable. 
                She has never been taken to these heights before. She has never 
                even imagined anything like this in her life. He has his arm buried 
                deep in her rectum all the way to the elbow. The fattest part 
                of his arm being about seven or eight inches in circumference. 
                Now he knows she is comfortable with the new feelings. He wants 
                to take her higher. He plows into her front opening with his other 
                fist. She is crying and moaning in ecstasy and pain combined. 
                Waves and waves of orgasm wash over her body. She has never come 
                like this before. She is completely impaled on two massive arms 
                pistoning in and out of her. She has never even had one orgasm 
                in her life let alone multiple orgasms. Miranda passed out from 
                the orgasms. When she awoke, she was still impaled on Ace&#8217;s 
                arms. Welcome back sweet thing, Ace tells her. Slowly he removes 
                the hand in her front. This feeling is so powerful she almost 
                climaxes again, now the careful process of removing the other 
                hand. He slowly backs out a little at a time, first back to the 
                forearm, then back to the wrist, now the hand slips out. This 
                pushes her over the edge and she climaxes again. Now it&#8217;s 
                his turn&#8230;&#8230;.. </p>
