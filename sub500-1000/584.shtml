        <p>The rain was falling outside the window when she woke up. She stretched 
          under the goose down comforter that had been pulled up around her neck 
          against the soft breeze coming through the open window. The clock read 
          7 am and she didn't have to go to work. She turned over onto her side 
          and listened to her body. She could hear her heartbeats in the rain 
          drops that fell on the sill. Underneath the covers, she began to touch 
          her skin. It felt soft and warm, almost sleepy, as if it were waiting 
          for her permission to awaken. The softness of the rain and the soft 
          warmth of her skin beneath her fingertips began a wetness in her sex. 
          She ran her fingertips over her breasts, stopping at the nipples to 
          rub and pinch them until they woke under her touch. She rolled back 
          over and began to squeeze her breasts enjoying the fullness and the 
          weight of them, pushing them together and pulling on the nipples. The 
          rain continued to fall, fueling the desire to almost an unbearable intensity.</p>
        <p>She ran one hand down her stomach under the elastic of her panties 
          and to the fur between her legs, gently pulling on the hairs until the 
          wetness began to soak the crotch of her panties. She lifted her bottom 
          and slid the cotton panties off her hips and down her legs. She continued 
          pulling on her nipples with one hand and with the other, she found the 
          small pearl that could give her the release she desired. She began to 
          rub in a circular motion and as she began to feel the first waves come 
          over her, the rain on the window sill began to fall harder as if it 
          knew the pleasure that she was feeling.</p>
        <p>Sliding first one finger then another into her pussy, she felt the 
          first orgasm come over her. Soft moans escaped her mouth with the ecstasy 
          she was feeling. She pushed her fingers in harder and the moans increased. 
          Thunder boomed outside her window. Her hips began to move to the rhythm 
          she felt inside and yet another wave began to wash over her. She slid 
          the fingers of one hand from her soaked pussy and clutched at her breasts, 
          kneading the nipples into hardness. The other hand softly rubbed her 
          clitoris in tiny circles keeping rhythm with the finger on her nipples. 
          The thunder was louder and the rain fell harder outside her window. 
          She cried out in ecstasy as the rainstorm roared through the summer 
          morning</p>
        <p>Slowly she slid her finger from her clitoris and softly ran then over 
          her lips and tongue, enjoying the taste of her sex. She crawled out 
          of bed onto mildly weak legs and enjoying the feeling of her juices 
          flowing from her pussy. She then smiled with satisfaction at the wet 
          spot she had created on the sheets. Pulling the sheets off of the bed, 
          she noticed the pattering of the rain on the sill had stopped.<br>
