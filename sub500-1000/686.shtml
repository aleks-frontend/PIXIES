        <p>Monday and Tuesday</p>
        <p>MONDAY</p>
        <p>Oh my secret lover! How can I live sanely after that wild and unbelievable 
          week? I still find it difficult to accept that it actually happened, 
          that I - that we - did all those things that had only ever been a fevered 
          fantasy of my darkest nights. Maybe it is this lack of belief that forces 
          me to write to you like this, put it all down. I don't know if I will 
          ever send this to you, but as a diary of that momentous week, it will 
          help me come to terms with the change you have brought to my quiet, 
          sheltered life. Maybe reliving it, writing down all those things - may 
          help me accept their reality. And, of course, I can reread and relive 
          it each night I lie alone with only my fingers for company.<br>
          How innocent it had all seemed, those late night online chats with a 
          distant stranger. A stranger who seemed to be able to read my secret 
          soul, my hidden inner self. And read it so easily! It was frightening 
          - and at the same time, so strangely liberating. You confused me so 
          much, you made me question so many of my long held beliefs. What did 
          it all mean? - That I had come across the one person in the world who 
          not only understood, but seemed to share my depravity? Or more wondrous 
          yet, that those fantasies, those desires, were not at all that unusual! 
          They were fantasies shared by a great many people, from different countries, 
          different cultures. That the things I felt were only part of the greater 
          human norm? Oh, you tried to reassure me of the latter, but despite 
          my own desires to believe you, I found it difficult to shake the convictions, 
          and constrictions, of my upbringing.</p>
        <p>You wrote about things that I had only dreamed about, not even knowing 
          exactly what those feelings meant, or even how to label them - never 
          mind how to put them into actual words. You freed that part of me, gave 
          me those labels, wrote about those things and feelings that made me 
          understand what it was I was seeking, however unconsciously. I told 
          you things that made me blush when I recalled them in the cold light 
          of day. I told you things that I had not even told myself - if that 
          is possible - but it certainly felt like it. Your words, your seductive 
          burning words, had me squirming in my seat, wet between the thighs. 
          It got so that I would take my knickers off before logging on to read 
          your latest depravities... and then rub and finger myself into a sweaty, 
          quivering wreck. You made me tell you what I was doing, describe the 
          intimate features of my life, of my body. Even now, I can feel the heat 
          in my cheeks at the memories of those early, liberating acts.</p>
        <p>There may have been a few thousand miles separating us, but you were 
          fucking me every night - mind fucking me. When I begged you for pictures, 
          images to feed my fever - you gave me more than I bargained for. And 
          that photo of your veined and gnarled erection filled my dreams, as 
          nightly I would fantasise, squatting over you, sinking down onto its 
          length, of you filling me with your phantom seed, feeling it oozing 
          and dripping out of me. I tasted you in my dreams, swallowing you despite 
          the fact that I had always found that so unpleasant in reality... and 
          contemplated acts that I had never dared. I indeed had enjoyed plenty 
          of sex... but nothing out of the ordinary, nothing depraved. Vanilla 
          sex you called it. Clumsy fumbles, muttered apologies and embarrassed 
          silences. All so polite, as if it was too difficult to contemplate the 
          crude slapping of sweaty skin, the flowing juices and sheer animalistic 
          nature of being soundly fucked. Your became the raspberry whirl, the 
          chocolate chip, sex of my imagination - and I ached for you each night, 
          for the things you did inside my head, the forbidden desires that you 
          caused to blossom in my darkest, wildest dreams. Rest easy, my lover.... 
          You lived up to your promises.</p>
        <p>When the chance came to accompany my boss, and most of the sales team, 
          to the London office arose, I seriously considered not telling you about 
          it. I was fearful, of my own fantasise - which could all too easily 
          become a terrifying reality. I considered refusing the chance to go... 
          but that dark part of my soul exalted, thrilled at the prospect of experiencing 
          even that slimmest chance that maybe... just maybe&#133;<br>
          You sounded pleased to know that I was due to visit your part of the 
          world. And, reading between the lines, fearful of just what might be 
          expected of you. You talk the talk, but could you walk the walk? I made 
          it as plain as I could that I would be busy, surrounded by colleagues, 
          not free from the nosey snoops and eagle eyed gossips, for any cosy 
          meetings or assignations. But looking back, I guess I did drop enough 
          hints to make my unspoken desires plain. If not, you did a wonderful 
          job of reading my mind.</p>
        <p>I was a nervous wreck all during the journey from the airport to the 
          hotel. Sonil (my boss) and Shamila, one of the pool secretaries, both 
          remarked upon the state of me - which I passed off as mere jet lag, 
          or maybe something of the airline breakfast that disagreed with me. 
          Shamila, a dark skinned, quiet girl had been assigned to share a room 
          with me. She had been chatty for most of the trip, working hard to be 
          friendly, and more than a little puzzled at my distracted indifference. 
          Arriving at the hotel, unloading under the carport, I recognised you 
          straight away. Standing casually near the revolving door, smartly dressed 
          and as if waiting for a tardy partner. I thought my heart had stopped 
          for a moment. It was an intense and frightening experience. You were 
          not simply a fevered figment of my imagination, an electronic phantom 
          that lived inside my home pc. You were a person - rather ordinary looking, 
          harmless even - but I knew how your circumcised penis curved upwards 
          when it was hard... while you, you knew my most secret, deeply hidden 
          inner thoughts. You knew details of my sexual fantasise and darkest 
          longings. I think I actually spent the rest of that week in a state 
          of semi-shock - spine tingling, electrifying orgasmic shock after orgasmic 
          shock.</p>
        <p>The hotel lobby seemed very crowed, since a party seemed to be checking 
          out, just as ours attempted to check in. Shamila, chattered on inanely 
          as we joined the queue for the concierge. Being girly and exited, about 
          sharing a room, seeing the city. I knew little about her, but so far 
          had found her rather dull, her childlike enthusiasms wearing - I knew 
          that I was being unfair, preoccupied with darker thoughts that jarred 
          with her girly chatter. I was very conscious of your presence, having 
          to fight hard not to stare at you. You photo's had been a good likeness. 
          I had recognised you instantly. You had moved inside with the crowd, 
          leaning casually against the wall, well out of the way. You were looking 
          straight at me, each time I risked a glance in your direction. Once 
          you gave me sly wink, then looked away innocently as if you were a total 
          stranger. I almost wet myself. You were here, breathing the same air 
          as I, surrounded by my company sales team in a hotel lobby - and I was 
          juicing up just thinking about that simple fact. You turned your gaze 
          back to me, then glanced pointedly at a service corridor the appeared 
          to lead towards the bathrooms. You jerked your head in the direction 
          of the corridor, and then walked nonchalantly down it. Your meaning 
          was clear enough. Heart in mouth, I turned to my prospective roommate.<br>
          &quot;Hold this a moment, Sham - I need the bathroom.&quot; And I handed 
          her my shoulder bag, and hurried after you, my legs feeling leaden and 
          clumsy. Around the corner, there was only a line of unmarked doors. 
          I had no idea where you had gone! Then one door opened and your hand 
          waved me towards it. As I approached, the door opened wider and you 
          reached out to pull me roughly into the small room. <br>
          There was a dim, naked bulb lighting the small room, allowing me to 
          see that it was some kind of store room. It was dusty, with little space 
          amongst the racks of cases and boxes. You held me at arms length and 
          paused long enough to take a long and thoughtful look at me. I panted 
          wordlessly under your scrutiny, feeling the wetness between my thighs. 
          Seeing the obvious pleasure in your gaze, I felt the fear in me recede 
          slightly. I breathed you in, male scent, hint of tabacco and spicy aftershave. 
          I felt dizzy, hot with shame and lust.<br>
          &quot;I so wanted... &quot; I started, but you placed a finger to my 
          lips and hushed me quiet. &quot;Don't talk', you breathed. You reached 
          between my thighs and rudely cupped my sex through my skirt. I froze 
          with shock, the sudden crude touch of you turning my blood to ice. Your 
          palm pressed against me, and you lips formed the words,<br>
          &quot;You're not here to talk. You came here to be fucked.&quot; The 
          crude truth of your words numbed me to my core. Your unsolicited touch 
          was the only reason I had hurried into this grubby closet with you. 
          My outraged protests died unspoken.<br>
          It also felt weirdly good, a relief. Nothing needed to explained, nothing 
          to be worried about. I knew why I was there. I was there to be used 
          by you, in whatever manner you choose, just as I had fantasised. It 
          was a release, an abdication of responsibility. What ever was going 
          to happen was not down to me or my actions. Stupid I know, but I had 
          given myself into your hands. Your hard, capable, and oh so cunning 
          hands.</p>
        <p>When you leaned forward, brushing your lips over mine, I heard myself 
          moan like some kind of animal. My pulse throbbing in my temples. The 
          hand between my thighs moved down and up under the hem of my skirt. 
          Your free arm slipped around my waist and crushed me to you, you mouth 
          pressed roughly over mine and your hand once more cupping my sex. Despite 
          my mental clamour, my body hungered for you touch, and I whimpered when 
          you pulled the cover of my knickers aside to slide a couple of long, 
          hard fingers deep into my cunt. A final mental scream, and my years 
          of respectable behaviour blew away in cloud of animal lust. I sucked 
          on your tongue and squirmed moistly on your impaling fingers. Foolish 
          me&#133; I never gave a thought to what doors I had just opened. You 
          brought me back to shocking reality within seconds. Your mouth moved 
          over my cheek and nuzzled my ear, and your softly whispered words turned 
          my boiling blood to ice. I blush to remember the whimper that escaped 
          me as your rough fingers withdrew from my body, the outraged shame I 
          suffered when you lifted them to your face, inhaling the scent of me. 
          Your eyes held mine, blatant, challenging, as you licked and tasted 
          me. I cringed as you pressed a pussy flavoured finger between my lips, 
          then shuddered as you spoke.<br>
          &quot;Do you spit or swallow?&quot; <br>
          I froze, stupefied as the meaning finally penetrated.<br>
          &quot;I am going to fuck your mouth.&quot; You confirmed for me.<br>
          &quot;You ... I can't... I..&quot; I finally stammered.<br>
          &quot;Shut up, kneel down and open wide&quot; and you commanded, your 
          tone brooking no dissent.<br>
          Everything seemed dream like, I was light-headed and I felt so powerless, 
          events so out of my control. I could never have contemplated giving 
          you a blow job if the choice had been left to me! But it was not my 
          choice, was it? The crowd of people only yards away never entered my 
          mind. I was too busy grappling with the idea that you were going to 
          put your penis in my mouth and that I was not going to resist such crudity. 
          Numb, I let you press me down onto my knees, suddenly very aware of 
          my aroma on your wet fingers. I struggled weakly, and totally ineffectually, 
          and then watched mesmerised as you unzipped your flies and produced 
          the veined organ that I had come to know in such fine detail from the 
          computer images. The number of times I had masturbated over that photograph 
          you had sent me. I had fantasised about this moment, this very act... 
          and now felt so totally overwhelmed by the reality of it. You pressed 
          the blunt tip to my lips and when I tried to jerk away, you held me 
          firmly in your hands, fingers tangled in my hair. You forced me forward 
          onto you, pursed lips firmly against the warm, living thickness. <br>
          &quot;Suck it&quot; you whispered, and with gentle tugs on my hair, 
          my mouth opened without any further conscious thought. Your thickness 
          filled me, stretching my jaws further open as you forced yourself into 
          me. I had never liked the act of oral sex, sucking on a penis - refusing 
          to give blow jobs if I possibly could. It was degrading, something I 
          had always resented doing... it gave me no pleasure at all. But this... 
          this was not of my choosing. I was being made to do this, to blow you... 
          No coy appraisal, no teasing licks or working up to the act of opening 
          my mouth to you... You were using me, there was no romance, no gentleness. 
          I was fully dressed, in my smart business suit, kneeling in a dingy 
          closet with your dick in my mouth. Friends and colleagues a few short 
          steps away, oblivious to the obscene act I was performing. I could feel 
          the hunger in you, the urgency - you had been thinking about this for 
          as long as I had. You wanted me, you wanted to fill my mouth, feel me 
          swallow you. I don't think that I had ever been so hot and horny in 
          my life. <br>
          I struggled to breath, fighting not to gag as you thrust repeatedly 
          into my open mouth. I could feel the smooth flare of your glans, the 
          veined surface of your shaft, with my tongue, tasting the salt and the 
          smear of pre cum, inhaling the scent of you. My pussy ached for your 
          touch and without thinking I reached up under my skirt to rub my soaked 
          knickers, rolling my eyes up to look at you. My left hand wrapped around 
          the base of your cock, partially to restrain your thrusts, but more 
          to feel your thickness, the throbbing warmth of you in my hand. Your 
          face was all strained, tense and filled with a lustful, pleasurable 
          agony. You acknowledged my strained glance by baring your teeth and 
          groaning. Your whole body trembled already so close to release. The 
          clear and graphic pleasure you were taking, watching yourself fucking 
          my open mouth became unbearably arousing. My enclosing fist pumped the 
          base of your shaft and I could feel the gathering explosion build to 
          its climax. 'Swallow it!' you grunted, and I distinctly felt the pulse 
          of your orgasm, as your cock jerked, and filled my mouth with your seed. 
          I ground my clenched fist against my sex, throat flexed as I swallowed 
          your slimy fluid... and my belly convulsed - and I had a strange little 
          orgasm all of my own. I sucked, and I swallowed, until your spurts subsided. 
          Rather breathless and still feeling dizzy, I licked and sucked the length 
          of you cock clean. Despite my efforts, some had leaked from my lips, 
          and I wiped my chin with the back of my hand. <br>
          You tucked yourself away and zipped your flies up, then helped me to 
          my feet. I was panting a little, from the sucking and from my own excitement. 
          You rather surprised me by kissing me passionately, open mouth on mine, 
          stealing the air from my lungs. Your hand reached up under my skirt 
          and you cupped my tingling cunt in your warm palm, as if to signify 
          your possession of me, and the promise of things to come. Your fingers 
          sought the moist opening once more and I could feel the heat in my face, 
          as my body pressed down onto you. I shuddered with shame and lust when 
          withdrew your fingers and once more, deliberately inhaled my hot scent. 
          My wide eyed gaze seemed to amuse you, then I was sucking on your soiled 
          fingers, tasting my own arousal, my cunt juices mingling with your sperm. 
          You kissed me again, sharing the subtle flavour of our sex once more. 
          You murmured unintelligibly into my open mouth. Breaking the kiss, you 
          spun me round, then slapped me hard on my behind. I opened the door 
          and stepped out into the hallway, with your parting whisper ringing 
          in my ears. 'Next time&#133;.&quot;</p>
        <p>I found Shamila waiting by the concierge, and took my bag from her. 
          'Everything alright?' she asked. <br>
          &quot;Of course, don't fuss - I'm fine.&quot; I muttered, still tasting 
          your semen in the back of my throat. She gave me a rather funny look, 
          then shrugged. <br>
          &quot;Our cases have been taken up already.&quot; <br>
          She had collected the key for our room, and I followed her to the elevator 
          still in heady post orgasmic daze. In the room, I unpacked on autopilot. 
          Shamila certainly noticed that I was acting rather spaced out and kept 
          asking me if I was alright. She was normally the quiet type, never volunteering 
          anything, always keeping her own council. I mentally shook myself and 
          tried to respond to her sensibly. She was darker skinned than I, with 
          long, black hair that made her rather ordinary features more striking. 
          Large expressive eyes and a button nose. A little on the plump side, 
          but with a fit looking body for all of that. I knew virtually nothing 
          about her personal life. She wore glasses, that gave her a kind of cute 
          school teacher look. I knew that she was not married, but had no idea 
          if she had a boyfriend or not. I suspected not, since she seemed extremely 
          na&iuml;ve and rarely understood the more risqu&eacute; jokes that the 
          male sales reps often cracked. I found myself wondering if she was a 
          virgin or what she would think of the indecent act I had just performed 
          in a hotel storeroom. I glowed inside at the sheer wantonness of it 
          all. Had she sucked on a hard dick? I confess that I found myself heating 
          up again, the sudden mental image of the demure Shamila on her knees, 
          chocking down a long hard dick - your long, hard dick. The thoughts 
          you stirred in me! I was still very sexually charged from what you had 
          just done to me. I had never looked at another women with sex so much 
          on my mind. I knew from you fevered writings how arousing the thought 
          of a little girl on girl was for you&#133; I wondered if her pussy tasted 
          like mine? God, I was going insane with the lusted you awaked in me. 
          I needed some release. I wanted to masturbate, relive that sordid, wanton 
          mouth fuck and finger myself senseless. Shamila inhibited me enough 
          that I knew that it would have to wait.</p>
        <p>It was almost midday, and once we had freshened up - clean knickers 
          a priority - and I had quickly dabbed at the odd semen stain on my blouse 
          - we joined the rest of our party for a late lunch. The rest of day 
          was taken up with various briefings I kept trying to work out what I 
          felt about what had happened, what you did to me. I would always start 
          off feeling disgusted with myself, with you. But each time I relived 
          kneeling in that grubby storeroom being fucked in the mouth... I knew 
          that I was a lost cause. I had enjoyed the sensation too much. I couldn't 
          recall having felt like that since... since that time my older cousin 
          had finger fucked me to orgasm at a family gathering. He had accosted 
          me in coming out of the bathroom and I had been too frightened to cause 
          a scene. I was totally innocent and he had easily frightened me into 
          shocked silence, and had fingered my virginal pussy roughly. I often 
          wondered how far he would have gone if we had not been disturbed. I 
          had avoided him from then on, too frightened of him, of what he made 
          me feel. Shame, disgust and explosive excitement at the forbidden nature 
          of it all. <br>
          I think I gave up trying to fight what my body was craving that first 
          afternoon. I guess that I stopped worrying about it. What ever was going 
          to happen... was going to happen.</p>
        <p>The afternoon dragged on endlessly, and I hated every drawn out minuet 
          of it. At last it all came to an end, and we were allowed to escape 
          back to the hotel. A group dinner had to be suffered before we could 
          escape to our rooms for an early night. Shamila unfortunately beat me 
          to the room, and found your envelope with my name on it under the door. 
          She raised an eyebrow, but said nothing, and I read the note in the 
          bathroom. I made some lame excuse and popped out to use a call box down 
          in the lobby, and called your mobile number. You never said a word about 
          the days events, simply asking for details of our planned itinerary. 
          When I told you about the theatre tomorrow night, you simply told me 
          to wear something nice. Your tone made me shiver. Details complete, 
          you wished me pleasant dreams (as you knew quite well what I would be 
          dreaming about!) and hung up. Another time, another place - another 
          person - and I would have been incensed at your treatment of me. As 
          it was, come the early bedtime, and Shamila had to knock on the bathroom 
          door to ask if I was ok again, as I had spent so long in there. Masturbating 
          myself silly.</p>
        <p>TUESDAY </p>
        <p>Waking up on that second morning, it took a little while for the events 
          of yesterday to come to me. As the full horror of that brief encounter 
          in the storeroom flooded back I felt rather sickened. I moaned aloud 
          - and then had to cover up my confusion as Shamila was once again fussing 
          over me. I almost confessed to her! I was on the point of blurting it 
          out when I recovered and reined back my emotions. Breakfast was an awkward, 
          silent affair, as I had slapped her down rather strongly - basically 
          telling her to mind her own business.</p>
        <p>The day was full of meetings, new faces and whirlwind trip around the 
          company offices. I more of less put you totally out of my mind - but 
          every glimpse of store room door brought back the taste of you. I was 
          more than relived when the day's events reached their conclusions, and 
          we all were shuttled back to the hotel. An early dinner, then it would 
          be time to get ready for the evenings entertainment. My pulse rate increased 
          at the thought.</p>
        <p>The company organised theatre trip. It was Miss Saigon at the Haymarket. 
          Rather a formal affair, and I dressed appropriately. I suspected that 
          the evening would include some kind of theatrical performance of the 
          participation type. In the bathroom I slipped on a white silk g-string 
          and then the garter belt and stockings. I had rarely worn stockings 
          before, but found them rather a sensuous experience. The air on my upper 
          thighs, and barely concealed mound had me damp with anticipation almost 
          immediately. I slipped into the long evening skirt and my dark silk 
          blouse. I wore a bra that fastened at the front. Shamila made a joke 
          about me looking good enough to eat, causing me to do a hurried double 
          take - then figured that it was an innocent enough remark. I did start 
          wondering if she suspected anything, as I was certainly acting very 
          jumpy.</p>
        <p>Taxi's whisked us off to the Haymarket, and we crowed into the theatre. 
          I saw you straight away, my eyes automatically scanning the crowd. You 
          were standing near the back of the foyer. You made a point of ignoring 
          me, looking for all the world like an impatient husband awaiting a tardy 
          wife. My heart began to beat faster. I could feel your eyes on me as 
          we queued to collect our tickets, feeling you assessing me, my appearance, 
          my dress. I became wet, right there, standing in the queue. I was once 
          again, kneeling in that squalid room, fear and adrenalin coursing through 
          my veins, chocking on your cock remorselessly fucking my mouth. A whorish 
          slave to your animal lust. When I next looked, you had disappeared. 
          I sat through the first half of the show with nervous anticipation. 
          I don't think I heard more than the odd word or two. I squirmed uncomfortably 
          on the seat, unable to get settled, the urge to soothe my own hot lust 
          almost unbearable. Shamila again asked me if I was ok, and I distractedly 
          attempted to reassure her. I ached to touch my clit, sate the hunger 
          between my thighs with a finger or two. I wondered if you would approach 
          me during the interval, and fought the urge to touch my anus, for if 
          you kept your word, it would never be the same virginal opening again. 
          Once the lights went up for the end of the first half, I walked round 
          the back of the theatre looking for you. I ended up being buttonholed 
          by my boss, who wanted to talk about the next days meeting with our 
          London office. It was only when you pressed that note into my hand, 
          behind my back that, I became aware of your presence. I scrutinized 
          the note the first chance I had - it simply said 'Start of the second 
          half - at the back'. I wondered briefly what you would do if I didn't 
          turn up&#133; but only for a moment.</p>
        <p>Once the lights went down for the second half, I eased out of my row, 
          apologising profusely saying that I needed some air. Shamila was all 
          for going with me, and I had to be quite sharp refusing her. I hurried 
          up the darkened isle, and found you waiting at the back of the auditorium. 
          My worries and fears seemed to melt away as you enfolded me in your 
          arms, your mouth one mine, and hungry, insistent. I was barely aware 
          of your fingers opening my blouse, but when you undid my bra, and my 
          breasts were suddenly free and very exposed, I stiffened in alarm. Although 
          it was gloomy at the back of the theatre, it was far from private. Anybody 
          in the rear seat could have seen me, breasts exposed, watched you suck 
          on my engorged nipples - and then as you raised the back of my long 
          skirt, my bare ass and the tiny white thong. I was suddenly panting 
          with fear and adrenalin, as you groped my bare behind, then slide your 
          fingers past the thong and deep into me. I could have died. </p>
        <p>But there were no cries of outrage or shock, and you finally relented, 
          letting my skirt fall to cover me. You took my hand, not letting me 
          even hold my open blouse closed and led me unresisting towards the &quot;Ladies&quot; 
          sign, through the curtain, and then the door. I had a moment of panic 
          and the urge to run back to the safety of the public auditorium. You 
          held me firmly, murmured kind of reassurance then bundled me inside 
          the mercifully empty room. I let you guide me into the end stall, silently 
          urging me inside, before you squeezed in behind me. My heart hammered 
          in my chest, I felt light-headed in you presence, almost as if I had 
          been drinking. When your hands gripped me forcefully by my upper arms 
          I couldn't help whimpering, then gulping apologetically when you hissed 
          at me to be quiet. Inside the stall, with the door locked it was claustrophobically 
          intense. Fear coursed through my veins, mixed with a horny excitement 
          in a buzzing cocktail of chemicals that made breathing difficult. You 
          turned me to face you, and forced your mouth over mine. I struggled 
          as you kissed me hard, ignoring my twisting and feeble attempts to avoid 
          you. My body craved you touch, while my mind screamed at me to resist 
          your control. Your hands ran over my body, squeezing my ass, fondling 
          my breasts. Then one ran up my back and under my hair, gripping me by 
          the back of my neck. You pulled me back, and stared into my eyes.<br>
          &quot;You're going to sit down and suck my cock, then I'm going to bend 
          you over and fuck you.&quot; Fear and lust coursed through my veins. 
          It was degrading, sordid&#133; it was making me wet with anticipation. 
          I couldn't&#133;<br>
          I started to voice some weak protest, ignoring you hissed 'Quiet!' You 
          pressed me down to sit upon the toilet seat, and you silenced my shocked 
          mutterings in your wonderfully direct fashion. You unzipped your trousers, 
          pulled out your throbbing erection and pressed to my open lips. I gagged, 
          shut up and gave up trying to reason, or plead with you. I wrapped one 
          hand around your shaft, holding you near the base, feeling your pubic 
          hair on my fingers. I pulled back, not wanting to choke on you, and 
          reached out with my tongue, and tentatively licked at the tip. The gentle 
          approach was clearly not what you had in mind. You shoved into my open 
          mouth, and I was once again struggling with the length and thickness 
          of you. You pulled on my hair, making my head move back and forth, sliding 
          my lips along your shaft. I savoured the raw male flavour, the tangible 
          evidence of your hard and throbbing desire for me. I was giving you 
          head within moments of our second ever meeting. There was a momentary 
          pang of shame, of remorse, at what this must say about my character, 
          but it quickly succumbed to the lusts that the act aroused in me. I 
          was a dirty little cocksucker and I was loving it.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>When the door of the Ladies banged open, I jumped, making you jerk 
          as I caught you with my teeth, causing you to hiss in pain. I froze, 
          you cock stilled, but continuing to fill me. Footsteps, that paused 
          outside the stall door, and then a timid knock. It was Shamila! She 
          asked if I was inside, while I sat immobile, your cock throbbing deep 
          in my mouth. Finally, receiving no response, we heard her leave. <br>
          &quot;Friend of yours?&quot; you whispered.<br>
          I mumbled unintelligibly around your cock, and with that, you pulled 
          out of my mouth. <br>
          &quot;Not really - but she is sharing my hotel room.&quot;<br>
          &quot;Wonder if she likes it up the ass?&quot; you mused<br>
          Oh God - I had the sudden image of plump little Shamila on her knees 
          with your cock jammed up her ass. I had never, ever, contemplated such 
          imagery in my life before. Heat flared between my thighs, behind my 
          eyes. Whatever my higher consciousness thought about such a sight, my 
          body flamed with a consuming lust. </p>
        <p>Shamila's sudden entrance seemed to bring a natural pause to events. 
          I was trying to get some breath back, when you were taken with my exposed 
          breasts once more. I loved the admiring, pleased noises you made - I 
          had always been unhappy with them, convinced that she had to bigger 
          to be found attractive. Over the months you had almost convinced me 
          that less was more, that the male stero type was exactly that - a stereotype, 
          of a crude and working class mentality. The true gentlemen, the connoisseur, 
          you insisted preferred the smaller variety. All I know for sure is that 
          you seemed to get a great deal of pleasure from mine. Another new experience 
          for me - having my tits fucked. You crouched, your slippery, spit wet 
          cock sliding over my breasts, and I pressed my smallish, pale brown 
          orbs together to form a gully for you to fuck. I revelled in the urgency 
          in your movements, the frantic, slippery thrusts of impending climax. 
          You groaned, then cursed as cock leapt and spat a stream of cum up my 
          chest, to my throat and chin. I barely had time to register a sharp 
          pang of disappointment, before my mouth was once more full of semen 
          smeared cock.</p>
        <p>I sucked on you&#133; tasting you, both disgusted and thrilled&#133; 
          and you stayed hard, filling my mouth without any noticeable change. 
          Your cum cooled on my breasts and throat, and I found myself rubbing 
          the slimy stuff into my swollen, sensitive nipples. My jaw ached and 
          I was just starting to wonder when this torment would end&#133; then 
          you pulled out of me, and helped me to my feet. I felt so powerless 
          when you turned my round and forced me to lean forward, my hands resting 
          on the seat to stop myself from falling face down. <br>
          I was trembling as you pulled the long skirt up my legs and folded it 
          roughly up over my back. Your gaze burned over my exposed bottom, and 
          I heard you gasp appreciatively. I guess you liked the stockings, and 
          that little white g-string?<br>
          I was more than ready for this, my body was hungering for the feel of 
          you inside me. My mind was less sure, but totally submissive to events 
          that seemed so out of my conscious control. I was suffering extreams 
          of split personality - half desperate for you, urging me on ward, the 
          other screaming in horror and outrage at what I was letting you do to 
          me. Then all thought dissolved as you slapped my quivering bottom - 
          the noise loud in the confined space. I shuddered as you ran your hands, 
          hot and hard, over my smooth, cool skin, exploring my thighs and butt 
          cheeks. The g-string gave you easy access to me, and I moaned when you 
          brushed it aside, exposing my dripping cunt and shrinking anus to your 
          steely gaze and your burning touch.<br>
          You were clearly in no hurry, taking time to run your hands over my 
          swollen pussy lips, releasing the moisture that had been building all 
          evening. Pussy juice wet my inner thighs and I moaned when you thumb 
          pressed between my slick labia, and into my hot cunt. It felt so good, 
          so what my body hungered for. Your fingers teased my anus, rubbing the 
          tight muscular ring, scratching gently over the puckered opening, before 
          probing gently. I knew that you had enjoyed and expressed desires about 
          anal sex&#133; and I had written back about my distaste, even fear of 
          that act. Still&#133; your fingertip felt good, so good that I found 
          myself pressing back against you, ignoring the fact that it forced you 
          finger deeper into my bottom. I sighed in frustration when you pulled 
          out of me, then had to bite back a cry of pleasure when I felt your 
          pussy wet thumb stretch my asshole a little wider. Two, long angular 
          fingers squeezed into my cunt, twirling and twisting inside me. My knees 
          shook so hard that I feared they could no longer bear my weight. I arched 
          my back, taking more weight onto my arms, forcing my hips back, driving 
          you deeper into me. </p>
        <p>Then came the heat and hardness of you cock between my upper thighs. 
          Your thumbs spread me wide and the tip of your cock was rubbing against 
          my dripping opening. I bit back a loud cry as your cock eased into my 
          slippery opening. You drew back, the tip rubbing over my swollen, pouting 
          lips. I ached for you, my knees trembling. The broad tip found me again, 
          paused and then drove deep into my cunt, sliding past the slick wet 
          lips and filling me with an uncomforting fullness. I had never felt 
          so tight&#133; or your cock had swollen appreciatively since filling 
          my mouth. Deep, deep in me, filling me, driving the breath from me&#133; 
          and you were still again, buried hilt deep in my body. You hands stroked 
          me, my bottom, flanks and round to tease my breasts. I was aware of 
          the quivering of your body, pressed to mine, your impaling cock trembling&#133; 
          Slowly you drew back, pulling agonizingly out of me&#133; Then you fucked 
          me. God you felt so good&#133; you felt so long and so beautifully hard. 
          It was what I had been dreaming about - although my bending over, fully 
          dressed in a public toilet like a cheap whore, had not been in my mental 
          script. I was sopping wet, squelching obscenely as you filled me repeatedly, 
          thrusting deep, knocking against my quivering cervix. When you plugged 
          your thumb into my bottom, I yelped at the unexpected assault. You stretched 
          me, but there was way too much pleasure coursing through my body to 
          register any real pain. It was disgusting, it was crude and sordid - 
          and it was going to make me cum hard and fast. I could feel my cunt 
          clenching around your hardness and then my muscles were jerking in a 
          sudden explosive orgasm. You fucked without pause, slaming hard against 
          me, balls thumping deliciously against my open, swollen lipped cunt. 
          You leaned forward, your hand covering my mouth to stifle my cries, 
          thrusting hard and fast into me. My knees threatened to give way, and 
          I was grateful for your other hand holding me around the waist, keeping 
          me from collapse. You brought me to a second, shockingly fast orgasm, 
          and you groaned when I bit hard against you fingers. Finally you paused 
          the brutish assault, and while I sobbed, my head hanging down, trying 
          to catch my breath. </p>
        <p>Now you fucked me slowly&#133; long, full length withdrawal that had 
          me whimpering, then an equally slow, deeply filling penetration. Despite 
          a double orgasm, I had never felt so small, so tight&#133; or a cock 
          so full and filling&#133; it had been a long time, too long, since I 
          had last had a man inside my body. I don't remember my ex being any 
          less well endowed than you&#133; a bad memory, or do we shrink from 
          lack of use? And for all that I was enjoying my tight, clasping cunt 
          - it was clearly having its effect upon you too. You were groaning deeper, 
          you body tense and clearly close to another explosive release. I was 
          a little surprised when you suddenly slipped out of me, but as awkward 
          as the cramped space allowed, I urgently twisted myself around, just 
          in time to receive my first proper facial. Just like a porno movie!</p>
        <p>Your pale, creamy fluid splashed across my face, my cheeks, nose and 
          forehead. Then you found my open mouth and once more I swallowed hungrily, 
          ignoring your hard pull on my hair, forcing my face into your groin, 
          hearing you grunt and groan in the throes of you own climax. You leaned 
          weakly against me for a while, your cock softening in my mouth. Then 
          you shook yourself, pulling away and zipping your trousers up. I re-seated 
          the soaked strip of my g-string and let my dress fall to the floor, 
          hiding my shame from the world. I shakily refastened my bra and buttoned 
          up my blouse. My thighs slid wetly against each other, my pussy seemed 
          to glow with inner heat. Weak kneed and wobbly I emerged from the stall. 
          One long hard, breast crushing hug and a long kiss and then you slipped 
          away. <br>
          A quick check in the mirror, a hasty smoothing of my roughly handled 
          hair, and I staggered back to my seat in the auditorium. My abused bottom 
          had me shifting around in my seat, unable to get comfortable, while 
          my senses were constantly assailed by the smell of sex. I was sure I 
          reeked of it. Shamila did give me some very curious looks, but feeling 
          smug and sluttish, I managed to ignore her - more or less. The rest 
          of the evening was pretty much a daze. Back at the hotel, I spent a 
          lifetime in the shower, soaping my sensitive, much abused pussy giving 
          myself a couple of sobbing orgasms in the process. I was very conscious 
          of Shamila's eyes on me when I finally emerged, wearing a long comfortable 
          t-shirt, and slipped into bed. I made it more than plain that I had 
          no desire to hold a conversation with her and fell asleep almost instantly.
