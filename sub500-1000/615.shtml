<p>Sitting in the lounge you're relaxed, sipping a glass of ice water, 
          and listening to the CD player. You look at the clock, it's around 8.30pm 
          and your tired after a long day at work. It's a warm night, the windows 
          are open and your laying back wearing a silk camisole. Laying your head 
          back and closing your eyes listening to the music playing in the back 
          ground, outside you hear the crickets chirping. Everything is peaceful, 
          you start to drift off into fitful little dreams as your mind unwinds 
          from work.</p>
        <p>You sit up at the change in the outside sounds, the crickets have stopped 
          and there is an air of something amiss. Moving to the window, you look 
          out into the dark trying to see if something or someone is out there. 
          It is dark, the wind has changed and the smell of approaching rain fills 
          the air. You love a summer storm, but there is something not quite right 
          outside. You move to the front door. Turning on the light you peer out 
          through the glass looking for anything out of place. Seeing it is clear 
          you open the door for a better look. You step out onto the grass and 
          look to the East at the approaching storm. Drawing in a lung full of 
          sweet air, making you feel alive and refreshed. Heading back inside, 
          you close the door and lock it for the night.</p>
        <p>Moving back to the lounge and resuming your position, you settle down 
          again and relax. The stereo changes CDs and the tempo is raised as Dire 
          Straits start singing 'Money for Nothing'. You hum along for a few bars, 
          then stop as you see what looks like a shadow cross from the kitchen 
          to the dinning room. Your blood freezes as you strain to hear any sounds 
          from the kitchen. An occasional drip from the tap pierces your senses 
          and your heart races, hoping that is was a figment of your imagination. 
          You get up and move towards the dining room, grabbing an ornament as 
          you move past the coffee table, hoping it might help if there is anything 
          there. Slowly approaching the dining room you stand around the corner 
          reaching in to turn on the light. You hesitate, readying yourself for 
          anything, then throwing the switch. Swinging around the corner, your 
          eyes are wide looking for anything out of the norm.</p>
        <p>Nothing. You release your breath, not realizing you were holding it 
          the whole time. You step into the room and look around further, under 
          the table, behind the buffet, even behind the curtains. Nothing. You 
          start to relax, maybe it is the approaching storm playing tricks on 
          you. You turn and walk out, as you're about to turn off the light you 
          hear a sound down the hall. This you know is not the wind, or anything 
          you are familiar with. Leaving the light on for comfort you move to 
          the kitchen. Standing in the middle of the kitchen, your pulse is racing 
          again, terror is starting to rise, something is very wrong. You grab 
          at the phone and start to punch numbers. There is no sound, is it broken, 
          are the batteries dead? Looking at the base station it is still plugged 
          in and the active light is on, that means it is still active. Your mind 
          races, and you start thinking aloud, &quot;OK, it's the batteries, it 
          has to be the batteries&quot;. You rummage through the draws trying 
          to find a new set. Nothing.</p>
        <p>Again your mind races, the other phone. &quot;The other phone is in 
          the Master bedroom. If I can get there everything will be all right. 
          I can ring and get someone to come and check the place out, make sure 
          everything is ok&quot;. Looking down the hall, your ears straining to 
          hear the sound again. Your eyes are darting this way and that, but there 
          is nothing. Your start to settle a bit, &quot;maybe it was nothing. 
          Maybe you were just hearing things&quot;. Turning on the hall light, 
          you proceed slowly cautiously, looking this way and that. You pause 
          at the doorway to the master bedroom, reaching in you turn on the light. 
          The light glows bright, illuminating the room, then blows. &quot;Shit. 
          Will nothing go right&quot;. You edge into the room making for the bedside 
          table. You reach the side of the bed and fumble with the phone receiver.</p>
        <p>As you start to punch in the numbers, a shadow crosses the wall in 
          front of you. You turn to look and suddenly your world is plunged into 
          darkness. You thrash wildly trying to remove what ever has been placed 
          over your head, but to no avail. You feel yourself being pushed onto 
          the bed, face down. Your face is pushed into the covers, you struggle 
          trying to escape. You scream &quot;Who are you? What do you want?&quot; 
          There is no reply. Your heart is racing, panic is setting in, you struggle 
          harder. You feel a knee pressed into your back, forcing you further 
          into the covers, slowing your struggles. A hand grabs your wrist and 
          pulls it behind your back, then your other wrist is pulled back as well. 
          Your struggles become harder. &quot;This should not be happening, I 
          have done nothing wrong, Why are you treating me like this, who are 
          you&quot;. Still no response.</p>
        <p>You try to move your hands from behind your back, but they are restrained. 
          You scream, a slap lands on your face stopping you instantly. The slap 
          was mild but jolting, unexpected. You struggle against your bonds, trying 
          to free yourself, trying to escape. The hands are back on you rolling 
          you onto your back. You feel something cold and sharp run across your 
          shoulder, then the tearing/cutting of material fills your ears. A cool 
          breeze washes over your body as your camisole is cut away and your are 
          left naked except for your panties. A warm feeling washes over you and 
          you release you are getting wet, exposed naked. Laying there on the 
          bed, unable to see your attacker, your mind races to conclusions. What 
          does he want of me, what is going to happen, am I going to be hurt, 
          even killed. You struggle again wanting to get away, run and hide, escape 
          this situation. Again a blow lands upon your cheek, causing you to cry.</p>
        <p>The hands pull you into the sitting position. Your body wants to respond 
          making it easy but your mind struggles with this invasion of your personal 
          space, your own home, your sanctuary. Your body bends forward and you 
          launch yourself forward, wanting to get to your feet and run. As you 
          move the hands grab you and throw you down on the floor, causing you 
          to yelp as your knees crash to the ground. A sharp slap is felt across 
          your ass, and you scream again at the sudden attack. Your body is racked 
          with pain, but you feel the warmth between your legs growing. You can't 
          work it out, here you are someone's captive and your are hot and wet. 
          You roll on your side trying to position yourself to kick out at your 
          attacker. The hands grab your hair and pull you up back onto the bed. 
          You are moved to the center of the bed and held by one hand as the other 
          grasps your ankle. You try to kick out but the pressure on both your 
          ankle and chest are increased as if he sensed that you were going to 
          try something.</p>
        <p>You feel your ankle being tied, then the hand moves to your other ankle 
          and ties it also. You legs are open and your flush with embarrassment. 
          Unable to move your hands from behind your back, your feet stretched 
          so your sex is open and exposed save for the cotton of your panties. 
          Your attacker moves off the bed and your flex your arms and legs, testing 
          the restraints, unable to move. You hear sounds coming from down the 
          hall and the stereo volume has been increased. Your ears strain trying 
          to hear anything at all. Where has he gone, what will happen to me? 
          These questions keep running through your mind. The sounds down the 
          hall get louder, the stranger is returning. Your body stiffens, preparing 
          you for anything. The hands touch your skin just under your breasts 
          and move around behind your back. You try to roll but the weight of 
          your attacker forces you down. He grabs your hands and you feel something 
          slip between the bonds. The hands move away and you feel your arms being 
          pulled back towards the top of the bed. You struggle against the movement, 
          but find you are now trussed completely, unable to raise your body off 
          the bed. You roll to your side but feel the pain in your arms rise and 
          your ankle restraints tighten. Your roll back flat and the pain stops.</p>
        <p>You feel his breath on your cheek, then his tongue as he licks up the 
          side of your face. Again the heat between your legs increases. You want 
          to close your legs, hiding the wet patch growing on your panties. The 
          cool air from the storm rushes in through the lounge windows, blowing 
          down the hall to the master bedroom. Your legs try to contract at the 
          rush of cool air on your wetness. Your body shivers and a small moan 
          escapes your lips. The hands return to your legs and you feel then being 
          opened wider, pressure being applied to your upper thighs. His hand 
          grazes the front of your panties and your hips thrust forward involuntary. 
          You catch yourself moaning softly. Again you feel the cold sharpness 
          of the blade against your skin, as he cuts away your panties. The air 
          is filled with the smell of your sex. Your knees tremble in anticipation. 
          You feel his weight move from the bed and you release your breath.</p>
        <p>Your body becomes alive as you are covered by a bucket of cold water. 
          Your nipples become erect and your wetness grows. The find makes your 
          skin cold and Goosebumps appear all over your body. You are cold and 
          wet and yet your body wants him to touch you again, you want to feel 
          him nearby. His weight presses down on the bed next to your head. He 
          grabs your hair and turns your head towards him. He grasps your nose 
          and you involuntary open your mouth to breathe. Suddenly his cock is 
          in your mouth, choking you. You move your jaw to bite him, hurt him, 
          but a tug on your hair reminds you he is in control. &quot;Suck&quot;, 
          is all you hear, his first words you have heard him say. You suck on 
          his erection and your mind tries to analysis his voice. There is a familiar 
          tone to it, you know it from somewhere but can't remember where.</p>
        <p>He grabs your hair and slides himself faster into your mouth, driving 
          his meat into your throat. You gag slightly at the thrusts and depth 
          that he is going down your throat. You try and move your face slightly 
          to ease the choking, but he holds your head steady and fucks your face 
          harder. You can taste his precum, then without warning he fills your 
          throat. He grabs your head harder and withdraws himself from your mouth, 
          then he holds your mouth closed forcing you to swallow it all. He removes 
          himself from the bed again and you hear him move off down the hall. 
          You lay there licking your lips, loving the taste of his cum. You feel 
          your juices running down your legs, hot wet and sticky. You freeze as 
          you realize he has re-entered the room and is watching you lick your 
          lips.</p>
        <p>You try to close your legs again to hide your wetness. The foot of 
          the bed sinks slightly as he moves up between your legs. You try and 
          roll, wanting to get away, to hide your exposed pussy. His hand moves 
          up your thigh again and your legs open, wanting begging. He stops short 
          of touching your outer lips. You clench your pussy tight, wanting to 
          be touch. He runs a finger over you and dips it into the entrance to 
          your sex. Your body shudders in orgasm, your sex opening and closing 
          trying to draw his fingers in deeper. He pulls his finger out and you 
          feel his eyes examining you, but you are helpless to do anything. His 
          hand returns to your wetness and your body stiffens as he inserts two 
          fingers into the entrance and opens you wide, letting the cold air rush 
          in to your wetness. You shudder again as he starts to open you wider, 
          running his finger around your outer lips. You try and lift your hips 
          but your restraints stop you.</p>
        <p>You gasp as something hard is pushed into you. He slides it quickly 
          into you, ramming it deeper. Your body tenses and you orgasm again at 
          the sudden intrusion to your privates. He drives it in again, this time 
          faster and deeper. Your body is racked by another orgasm. You can feel 
          his finger on your clit, pushing it down hard. Your body is tense, loving 
          the feel of what he has driven inside of you, loving the feel of his 
          finger on your clit. He removes the object, and you sigh as your pussy 
          twitches wanting to be filled again. He fills you again, this time with 
          something larger, longer. You want to draw your knees back to your chest 
          and allow this intruder to drive the object deeper into you, but your 
          legs restraints prevent you. You feel the object deep inside you, but 
          it is no longer being push. He places his hands on your inner thighs 
          and squeezes hard making you gasp as his hold increases and you start 
          to feel is nails digging in. You feel his head brush your inner thighs, 
          then the heat of his tongue on your clit. His touch feels like burning 
          acid, and you moan with pleasure as he licks you hard. His tongue snakes 
          its way around the object intruding your cunt. You feel the object move 
          to his touch, then you squeal, when it starts vibrating. It starts to 
          work its way into you, vibrating like you have never felt anything vibrate 
          before. Your body is racked with another orgasm. You start to feel lightheaded 
          and feel yourself lifting. You realize he has moved his hands under 
          your ass and is lifting you slightly off the bed. His thumbs massaging 
          the skin around your virgin ass hole.</p>
        <p>You start to moan again from the feel of the vibrator, then scream 
          as he thrusts two fingers deep into your ass. You try to fight the intrusion, 
          but it only causes him to slip his fingers in deeper. The pressure from 
          the vibe is getting greater and greater, and you start to yell in orgasm. 
          Suddenly he is gone, and he has removed the vibe, which you needed. 
          Your cunt is dripping wanting more, needing to be filled. You feel the 
          restrains on one ankle then the other being released. You flex your 
          feet and legs, allowing the blood to circulate again. You feel him moving 
          back to the bed and think about kicking out. You stop yourself remembering 
          the slaps and the restrains he had you in. You true to sit up but a 
          tug on your arms reminds you that he still has you tethered. You feel 
          his hands on your legs, rolling you on your side. You roll with him. 
          He pushes you onto your knees. In this position the arm restraints become 
          a little less restricting and you are able to relax your hands and arms 
          a little.</p>
        <p>You hear it before you feel the belt land on your exposed ass. The 
          sting is quickly forgotten as a second blow falls below the first. You 
          lean forward trying to evade the hits. A third stroke cross your ass, 
          slicing across the first hit. You scream out again. You feel the heat 
          across your ass, but also the fire in your pussy. The belt had brought 
          something out in you and you want more. You feel his hands on your ass 
          massaging the marks left by the belt. He is spreading your cheeks wider, 
          opening you. You shiver as another blast of air rushes across your exposed 
          wetness. You feel his fingers circling your ass hole again and some 
          cool liquid flowing over its entrance. He places one hand on your back 
          and you feel a sharp pain as something is driven into your ass. You 
          try to squeeze your ass together to force/keep it out, but he pushes 
          it deeper. You try again, and realize that it is in you and there is 
          no way for you to remove it. His hands brush over your outer lips again, 
          then you feel his finger back inside you. Your pussy tightens, feeling 
          the fingers inside. His hand reaches under you and grabs your nipples 
          twisting them slightly, making them grow. You wiggle your hips trying 
          to get his fingers deeper into you. His hand leaves your nipple, and 
          you let out a sigh at the lost of the pressure being removed. He withdraws 
          his fingers from you and you feel his weight leave the bed again. You 
          shudder as the cold storm winds blow in from outside and straight up 
          between your legs. You tighten your cunt and feel the plug in your ass 
          draw in slightly. You moan at the feel of its movement.</p>
        <p>Again there is silence and your mind starts to worry, where is he, 
          what does he have planned for me? You hear movement to your right and 
          shudder as the belt comes down over your ass again. You feel the wetness 
          rise in your cunt again, and thrust your ass up a little anticipating 
          the next blow, which doesn't come. Instead you feel him between your 
          legs again, pushing the plug deeper into you. The sensation now drives 
          shivers through your body, causing your pussy to contract again. He 
          slides two fingers back into you and stretches you wide. You feel him 
          touching your inner leg, then he drives himself into you sharply, driving 
          your head into the bed and your arms stretched against the restraints. 
          You moan from his entry and your breathing shallows because of the pain 
          in your arms. He drives into you again, you feel like you are splitting. 
          He roughly shoves himself into you, driving harder and harder. You feel 
          one of his hands pushing the plug deeper into you, his other hand grabs 
          your hair and pulls sharply back. You feel him tighten and he pumps 
          himself into you, cumming deep inside. He continues driving into you, 
          your juices and his cum dripping down your legs.</p>
        <p>He pulls out of you and wipes his cock across your back. You are helpless, 
          ties and blindfolded unable to move, unknowing what he is going to do 
          next. Fear over takes you again, as you realize he has raped you and 
          now you fear the worst. You have seen it all before on the news, in 
          the paper. You turn your head to the side and start to scream. His hand 
          comes down across your cheek again. You hear a door opening and wonder 
          what he is doing. Your ears strain to listen to his action. The sound 
          of running water scares you, &quot;is he going to drown me now?&quot; 
          You feel his weight near your head and his hands on your back as he 
          releases the rope holding you to the bed. He sits you up and rotates 
          your legs towards the side. Helping you to stand he leads you the ensuite. 
          On entering you feel the warmth of the steam. He leads you to the side 
          of the bath and sits you down. You sit, ears alert listening to him, 
          thinking of a way to escape.</p>
        <p>You sense him close. He opens your legs and spreads you wide, exposing 
          you to him again. He rubs his hand across your outer lips and trails 
          up to your breasts. You tremble slightly, wondering what is next. He 
          pushes you back slightly and you feel his hand brace your inner thigh. 
          A cold blob hits your crutch. His fingers work the blob around your 
          pubic hair. You bite your lip, you have had it shaved before, but here 
          was someone you know not who about to shave you. The razor slashes across 
          you and you can hear the hair being cut away. He continues until you 
          are smooth. You feel a towel wiping across you, and then his fingers 
          rubbing the area, massaging in the cream. He dips his fingers into you 
          again, and you bit your lip to stop yourself from crying out.</p>
        <p>He pushes you back and you fall into a hot bath. He moves forward and 
          moves you to the edge keeping your head above the water level. Your 
          mind panics thinking about being drowned, then reason kicks in and you 
          think why would he shave me if he wanted to kill me? Sitting in the 
          water your wriggle your hands trying to loosen the restraints on your 
          hands. After a few movements you feel them starting to give. First one 
          then the other hand releases itself. You leave your hands behind your 
          back in case he is nearby and see that you are loose. You lean your 
          head and try to hear where he is, but nothing. All you hear is the sound 
          of the storm outside, and the music from the CD player.</p>
              <p>Lifting your hand of the water, you slowly lift the blindfold and peer 
                around. Not seeing anything, you remove the blindfold completely. 
                You look towards the bedroom, trying to see if he is around. Standing 
                up, you step out of the bath and look around. You see nothing, 
                the bedroom is empty. You move out towards the lounge, looking 
                for any signs of the intruder. Moving to the Kitchen you see a 
                note on the Bench. 'Thank you for your time and effort. You may 
                see me again next storm hehehe'. Outside the storm was easing 
                and the wind dying. Everything returning as it was before the 
                disturbance. You walk to the door and it is still locked from 
                the inside. You look around and see the curtains pulled to one 
                side and the window open. You reach between your legs and feel 
                the puffiness of your lips and your juices running down your legs. 
                A smile crosses your face and you silently wish it could happen 
                again soon.</p>
