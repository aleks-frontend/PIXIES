              <p> Amy loved her job, but she had no illusions about what her job 
                really was. After all, you couldn't expect success if you pretended 
                it was anything else. She was a sex performer, and she was paid 
                to have sex on stage several times a night whenever it was her 
                shift. And sex, whether on stage, for film or in private, was 
                still sex. It meant disrobing, it meant groping and above all 
                it meant penetration. That was what the punters expected and what 
                they were paying for. The art of it was in making the sex as watchable 
                as possible. And this meant that it had to be entertaining, fully 
                visible and as shocking as possible.<p>
                There was no sexual act she could think of that she wouldn't do, 
                as long as it left no marks which might appear in later performances 
                in her shift. She would have sex with one man, two men, several 
                men. Equally as much, she would have sex with an equal number 
                of women. Her arse and cunt would take any object that would fit: 
                animate or inanimate, fist, prick or tongue. Only the laws of 
                the land prevented her from extending her range to include animals 
                or children. The stage was her bed and her boudoir, and she would 
                take on all comers, both from the paying audience and from her 
                cast of co-stars.<p>
                She would stretch herself out naked on the stage, or dressed in 
                latex or leather, her long golden brown hair flopping onto the 
                stage, her freckled face and shoulders lashed with semen, while 
                behind her a cock pounded into her arse and underneath the strapped-on 
                dildo attached to one of her female colleagues pushed more awkwardly 
                into her cunt. Her smiling, grimacing face, crumpled in ecstasy 
                and excitement faced the audience, a face whose oriental eyes 
                and features inherited from her Chinese mother belied the Celtic 
                freckles and fair hair inherited from her Scottish father. Her 
                body was all her own, spared the need for surgical enhancement 
                by the full round apple contours of her breasts and the slim frame 
                kept trim and taut in the gym. And her enthusiasm and ecstasy 
                was all her own as well. The very thought of what she was doing, 
                in front of so many panting, gasping punters, gave that extra 
                erotic impetus which made her sexual acts the most popular and 
                eagerly awaited in the club.<p>
                And her sex life was as integral to her character as her sparkling 
                blue-grey eyes, and her small nose. She was surely obsessed. Every 
                day she would have sex with one, two or more people, and she didn't 
                really count those on stage. That, after all, was her job. It 
                was not necessarily at a time of her choosing and not necessarily 
                with anyone of her choosing. Not that she was that choosy. Well, 
                she might be insofar as any second or third time might be, but 
                for first-time fucks, it was anyone and everyone. And she kept 
                a diary, which she'd started from when she was oh! so young. And 
                in this diary, she recorded every fuck, every sexual act, but 
                not those on stage, and awarded each one a coded description and 
                a mark out of ten.<p>
                She'd always done this. Some people's diaries are a record of 
                their innermost thoughts. An account of their feelings, their 
                ambitions, their worries and their happiness. Others are a more 
                objective account of events, perhaps noting people and places. 
                Amy didn't even bother with names. Even initials were suspect. 
                After all, she couldn't expect to know the name of everyone she'd 
                had sex with. Her diary entries were brief and to the point. She 
                would mention gender, number and any especially pertinent feature 
                of the occasion. And then a mark out of ten. Occasionally, she 
                might add a comment, like 'Took too long', 'Tiny prick' or 'Smelly'. 
                And that was it. To anyone reading her diary, it might as well 
                be a shopping list. <p>
                She had her diary in front of her, cross-legged on her futon, 
                while a naked woman lay on her front beside her. Amy was smoking 
                a cigarette, while her fibre-tip pen hovered over the blank paper. 
                It was a fresh page, and she always kept a diary on unlined, unheaded 
                pages, so she could get several days' entries on one page. In 
                the bathroom, she could see a hairy, bare arse where a man was 
                washing semen off his groin. She smiled, and entered the date 
                in numbers, with a vertical slash between the day, month and year 
                columns. And then in her neat, tiny handwriting: &quot;1M 1F 4/10&quot;. 
                Then she paused for thought before adding &quot;Sloppy&quot;.<p>
                She turned back to the previous page which was dense with similar 
                entries, and took a note of the numbers at the side, which showed 
                her totals. It was proudly in four digits now. And she was even 
                prouder of the fact that the total for 'F' was fast approaching 
                that for 'M'. So proud that she mouthed it to herself: &quot;One 
                Thousand Seven Hundred and Forty Three.&quot; At this rate, the 
                'F's would overtake the 'M's. And before she'd reached the two 
                thousand. And adding the 'F's to the 'M's. Why! That was already 
                over three thousand. That meant that for the ten years she'd been 
                sexually active, that had been on average, just under one a day. 
                Of course, she was making up for it now. One a day! God! That 
                would be a piss poor day. Normally she'd have three or four times 
                that number. She grinned to herself. She loved statistics. She 
                didn't know why she did, but somehow all these numbers added meaning 
                and shape to her life. <p>
                Often when she was alone, she'd take out her diary and pore over 
                the days, looking at the progression on the total, smile at those 
                days which had been particularly eventful where her tally had 
                increased by the most, and perhaps frown at the relatively low 
                scores that might be associated with it. She had very high standards. 
                A seven was pretty good. And not given lightly. An eight was rare. 
                A nine rarer still. And a ten. Well! Could that even exist?<p>
                Often she wondered about what would have happened if she'd included 
                her on-stage sex in her total. What would that have done? And 
                would that be cheating? Would that make her an entry into the 
                Guinness Book of Records? But they didn't really have that kind 
                of thing in there. Or did they? She wasn't sure. But she wasn't 
                sure she'd want her photograph or name in something like that. 
                It was bad enough pretending to her Mum that all the money she 
                was earning and the lovely down-town flat she'd bought cash down 
                had somehow come as a result of exercising the skills she'd gained 
                at secretarial college. And her divorced father. It was bad enough 
                that he knew where she lived and still sent her cards at Christmas 
                and on her Birthday. What would happen if he knew more about what 
                his darling daughter did for a living, for whom he'd paid her 
                mother an allowance for so many years? <p>
                Getting fresh sexual partners wasn't as easy as all that. After 
                all, Amy had soon exhausted all those at the night club. And not 
                just the other performers, whether male or female. There was the 
                janitor, the ticket clerks, the manager and that woman who did 
                the fancy backdrops. There were the people in the audience for 
                sure, but the management weren't too keen on their paying customers 
                getting too familiar with the goods. They might not want to continue 
                paying for the pleasure of just seeing them. <p>
                Amy was a regular visitor at a number of caf&eacute;s, bars and 
                clubs where she could be sure of finding someone, male or female, 
                or both, just the one, or several at the same time, with whom 
                she could increment her tally of fresh conquests, whether at their 
                place (preferred) or at hers (if necessary) or perhaps some other 
                place (as long as she didn't have to pay for it!).<p>
                Of course she had to be careful. Especially with the men. You 
                heard such stories! She kept a handbag full of condoms. All different 
                shapes and sizes and flavours. Ribbed and nobbled and smooth. 
                And sometimes, especially when there were three or more men, you 
                just couldn't risk taking them back or letting them take you back. 
                Then the back of the car, or a dark alley-way, or whatever. It 
                just had to do. Not so good for the actual sex, but more than 
                compensated by the extra notches it scored. Couples were fine. 
                Two couples a little more risky, but not by too much. But women. 
                No problem at all! If only more of them were willing!<p>
                Naturally, the more indiscriminate you were then the worse the 
                sex. The number of ones and twos she'd had to award. And the zeros! 
                When it was sex in only the most technical sense. But it still 
                counted. That was the main thing. It might be crap, but it was 
                clothes off, genitals in place, and a bit of sweat. But it counted.<p>
                Inevitably, the best sex came from her colleagues. They were after 
                all professionals. They knew what to do and they knew how to give 
                pleasure. And they were the lucky ones who got the chance to do 
                it again, even though it didn't count against the total. But then 
                you had to have some pleasure in your life. And she recorded them, 
                and awarded them the sevens or even eights that made it all worth 
                while.<p>
                So whenever a new girl or a new man started working at the club, 
                Amy took especial interest in them, even though she'd invariably 
                had sex with them on stage before they were able to get entered 
                properly as a proper fuck back her own flat or even at theirs. 
                Those were the good ones. That's when she was able to truly enjoy 
                herself, the sweat streaming down the hard, muscular contours 
                of her limbs, her mouth musky and sour from the taste of sexual 
                fluids, her cunt stretched and sore from their thrusting, groping 
                and stroking.<p>
                And so it was that Amy was particularly looking forward to a night 
                of real passion when Lucinda started working at the club. And 
                Lucinda was her real name as well. Not one of those made-up names 
                like some of the girls adopted. And even some of the men,. Not 
                Savannah, Asia, Chesty or Satin. And such a pretty girl as well. 
                She salivated at just the thought of her, as Lucinda nervously 
                entered the changing room in her unusually drab clothes. A blouse, 
                a skirt and woollen tights. Her shoes were flat and dull, and 
                her dark brown shoulder-length hair was actually tied back with 
                a dull green hair band. Fuck! Do people really dress like that. 
                Amy usually wore clothes only just on the right side of decency, 
                made from latex or satin or silk, to encourage lustful thoughts 
                and proclaim her intentions. Amy couldn't wait until this girl 
                could strip off to be sure that her body matched the beauty of 
                her well-scrubbed face, free of mascara, eye-liner or lipstick. 
                You wouldn't have imagined her as a sex performer.<p>
                However, Bob, the stage manager, assured the girls that this indeed 
                was what Lucinda was. She'd previously been working as the Garotta 
                A-Go-Go on the east side of town, but she'd fallen out with the 
                management who kept on wanting her to do things she hadn't wanted 
                to do. But, as he reminded them, their loss was a gain for the 
                Hardcore Heaven. <p>
                &quot;And what won't she do?&quot; wondered Dirk Dongle, whose 
                prick had a special place in Amy's arse, as he never tired of 
                reminding her.<p>
                &quot;Well, men, basically,&quot; Bob told them. &quot;She won't 
                do men at all. So, that's you out, Dirk. Otherwise, she'll do 
                everything. And I know. I've seen her. She's fucking good. She'll 
                do anal and double penetration and fisting and even pissing. I've 
                heard she'd even done on-stage shitting, but as you know we don't 
                do that until it's really late. And she gets the crowd going. 
                She's a fucking draw. We expect to get a lot of the Garotta's 
                crowd down here. And that can't be bad!&quot;<p>
                &quot;She don't look much,&quot; sniffed Mandy, a tall India girl 
                with a weird tattoo on her arse. <p>
                &quot;She wears proper gear on stage,&quot; Bob assured them. 
                &quot;She's not like that naturist who wouldn't even wear heels 
                on stage.&quot;<p>
                Amy liked the sound of this girl. And as top-ranking girl she 
                knew that she'd be the one to get first taste of her. And then 
                back to her place afterwards, she reckoned, maybe just the two 
                of them, without inviting back one of the other girls, even Ebony, 
                the Jamaican girl who she normally always had time for, even if 
                extra sex with her didn't officially count. And if she was that 
                good, well, maybe she'd be an eight. Or even a nine! But that 
                would be too much of a good thing.<p>
                And so it was to be. But not before Amy's appetite had been whetted 
                with a bit of double penetration from Dirk and Handy Andy, underneath 
                the strobes, in front of the early evening audience. Amy blew 
                kisses at some of the regulars and some new ones she'd never seen 
                before, while Dirk's prick thrust in and out of her arse, and 
                she lowered and raised her crotch on Andy's ever-reliable ten-inch 
                prick. It was a good night. There was a good atmosphere. She grinned 
                avariciously at the pile of notes that were scattered on the stage 
                and were being added to as the punters tossed more towards her. 
                She'd get her normal 50%, while the two men would have to split 
                the other half between them. A good night's haul, and the night 
                was still oh! so very young.<p>
                Back in the dressing room, she watched as Lucinda exchanged her 
                drab clothes for stocking, heels and a tight latex skirt which 
                just about hid the splendid melons of her breast and obscured 
                only the tiniest of thongs. She stood behind Lucinda, and placed 
                her hands on the girl's bare shoulders, and smiled at her reflection 
                in the mirror with its newly applied bright red lipstick. &quot;It's 
                going to be so good, isn't it?&quot; she gushed enthusiastically.<p>
                Without comment, Lucinda raised her hands to her shoulders and 
                firmly removed Amy's hands, which rather startled her. She smiled 
                sadly. &quot;I'm sure it will be.&quot; Then she turned her head 
                round and looked into Amy's face. &quot;You will be gentle with 
                me, won't you? At least at first.&quot;<p>
                Amy was too put back by Lucinda's rejection of her very innocent 
                advances to do anything but nod. &quot;Yes, of course,&quot; she 
                replied, as an uncharacteristic warmth spread over her cheeks. 
                How dare Lucinda! Was she going to be as much a cold fish on stage?<p>
                However, such fears were misplaced, when the lights went up on 
                the two girls as they came on stage to the excited whoops of the 
                audience. As soon as they were in action, Lucinda was as warm 
                and intimate as a girl could be. An expert improviser, sensing 
                Amy's most sensual spots, and neither hurried nor too slow. Just 
                right, in fact. The two stripped each other on stage. The stockings 
                were pulled down, the dress was hauled up, hands groped over breast, 
                back and even the precious shoulders. Their tongues waggled at 
                a distance, and then with warmth and passion, their mouths interlocked 
                while their hands felt around each other's spine and bottom. And 
                soon the fingers, tongues and teeth were on each other's vagina 
                and anus. Amy was suitably impressed. Although, unlike her, Lucinda 
                clearly never shaved her pubic hairs or even trimmed them, they 
                were perfectly shaped and not too long. And in amongst the hairs 
                were the beautiful folds of a perfect vagina, which kept its glory 
                inside rather than dropping it out like so many of the other girls. 
                Especially Corrie's. That girl couldn't hold anything in, let 
                alone her cunt. And that lovely puckered anus. And the flavour 
                of it. Bittersweet to the taste and rich in odour. Just as she 
                preferred. <p>
                But true to her word, Amy probed only with her fingers, and left 
                it up to Lucinda to do the penetration, which she did efficiently 
                and expertly with the clear purple dildo that was provided for 
                the job. And Amy didn't know where it came from, but even with 
                the audience whooping at her, all she was really conscious of 
                was Lucinda and her fingers and the way it made her vagina ache 
                from pleasure. More so than Handy Andy or even Georgy Porgy had 
                ever been able to do with the real thing.<p>
                As they left, the stage, Amy quickly kissed Lucinda full on the 
                lips. &quot;That was fucking great!&quot; She said. &quot;You're 
                a real fucking professional.&quot;<p>
                Lucinda carefully wiped her lips with the back of her hand and 
                made no comment.<p>
                Amy wasn't that easily put off. &quot;So, after we've finished, 
                are you coming back with me? To my place. I've got a great flat, 
                you know. And a really big comfortable bed. And then we can carry 
                on where we've just left off.&quot;<p>
                Lucinda frowned. &quot;Are you asking me back to your flat to 
                have sex with you?&quot; she asked flatly.<p>
                Amy smiled broadly. &quot;Of course. It'd be such good fun!&quot;<p>
                Lucinda carefully sat down on her chair by the mirror, still with 
                a frown on her face. She looked up at Amy. &quot;I'm very flattered, 
                er, Amy,&quot; she said politely. &quot;And, no offence. You are 
                a very attractive girl. And I'm sure your feelings are genuine. 
                But, er, Amy. I'm afraid, it's out of the question.&quot;<p>
                And then Lucinda turned her head to face her reflection, ignoring 
                Amy while she tidied up the lipstick on her mouth.<p>
                Amy wasn't that easily put off. &quot;You can't be meaning that! 
                I mean, you were pretty much game on the stage. Why can't we do 
                the same thing more intimately and more privately? I know you'd 
                enjoy it.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Amy.&quot; Said Lucinda firmly and not facing Amy at all. 
                &quot;What I do on stage and do for a living is one thing. And 
                what I do when I'm not on stage and not doing it for a living 
                is another. Please accept that, and I'm sure we'll get on fine.&quot;<p>
                For the second time that evening, and for only the second time 
                she could ever recall in her entire memory, Amy reddened from 
                the humiliation of rejection. She attempted to say something, 
                but her tongue, despite still tasting of Lucinda's vulva, was 
                somehow tied and she lost all ability for coherent response. Without 
                a word, she wandered off to her own chair by the mirror and studied 
                her own freckled face, damp strands of hair plastered to the forehead, 
                with its oriental eyes and full red lips, and tried to reassure 
                herself that in some way that she'd never before suspected she 
                was not after all unattractive. <p>
                How could it be that anyone, male or female, would not succumb 
                to her beauty? Especially a woman who only moments ago was clearly 
                enjoying her body, and whose stated preference was indeed for 
                women and not for men at all. What strange thing was this? And 
                had she done anything to deserve this rebuff?<p>
                Amy wasn't a girl who gave up easily, and she still had two more 
                appearances with Lucinda that evening to look forward to; but 
                in both cases, it was the same. On stage, Lucinda was passionate, 
                sensual and sexy. In no way did she seem abashed or reluctant, 
                expressing her joy unambiguously as Amy penetrated her with a 
                dildo or licked her clitoris. Her passion didn't seem to be at 
                all feigned, and she still managed to synchronise her sexual activity 
                to the slow, loud beating of the music in the night club, somehow 
                unfazed by the pressure of all the male eyes on her.<p>
                And then, off stage, she showed no interest in Amy at all, who 
                endeavoured to repeat her entreaties that Lucinda should come 
                back with her, but meeting only with a polite refusal. Amy was 
                disappointed. She'd been so looking forward to her new conquest, 
                and it just wasn't to be. And so, despite the lateness of the 
                hour, when she finished work for the evening, she headed off to 
                a night club she knew to pick someone up, anyone, it didn't matter.<p>
                The two young and skinny girls she picked up weren't that bad. 
                In fact, she'd awarded them a six, despite the fact that there 
                were so off their faces that they really made no objection to 
                the indignities she put them through. Amy wasn't even sure the 
                girls had ever had sex with each other before, let alone any other 
                woman. But they gamely took dildos into their cunts and arses, 
                and showed a fair bit of enthusiasm, even though they did fall 
                asleep rather too promptly after they had climaxed. As Amy noted 
                '2F' in her diary, and incremented her total of women conquests 
                accordingly, she still felt empty and unsatisfied. Neither of 
                them were as good or as beautiful or as passionate as Lucinda, 
                who she remembered so fondly. Neither of them could be rated as 
                the nine that Amy was convinced that sex with Lucinda would have 
                scored. But she set aside her diary, locked it in a drawer with 
                a little key, and nestled on her bed between the two girls, and 
                sighed. Tomorrow was another day, and Amy was used to getting 
                her way.<p>
                However, Lucinda was more of a challenge than even Amy could crack. 
                However much she pleaded and begged and cajoled, Lucinda was steadily 
                adamant that sex on stage was one thing, but off-stage was another. 
                &quot;I mean, don't you have any other girlfriends you can spend 
                the night with?&quot; Lucinda inquired ingenuously a few days 
                later. <p>
                Amy sighed resignedly. She'd already resorted to having a night 
                with the pesky Candy on an evening when her disappointment at 
                not bedding Lucinda had most distressed her. Not that Candy was 
                that bad. She had a lovely smooth crotch and was always very energetic, 
                but sex with her in no way improved her total and was not really 
                what she was looking for. <p>
                And at the same time, sex on stage was just as passionate and 
                orgasmic as ever. Amy found herself particularly looking forward 
                to these moments of ecstasy more than the sex she had in the evening 
                in the comfort and luxury of her bed in her luxurious apartment 
                with whoever it was that she'd picked up for the evening. But 
                she found she was taking out her frustration in Lucinda's rejection 
                in harder and more aggressive sex. She pissed on Lucinda one evening, 
                even though it wasn't in the script. She forced her fist deep 
                inside Lucinda's vagina until the girl squirmed. She nibbled and 
                bit her clitoris and nipples while Lucinda gasped as much from 
                pain, if not more so, than for pleasure. She pushed larger and 
                larger dildos into Lucinda's orifices to the amazement and satisfaction 
                of the audience who cheered loudly at the extent of the punishment 
                that was being displayed.<p>
                Amy even tried to tempt Lucinda back with the promise of an evening 
                out with no sex at all, but Lucinda wasn't having any of it. &quot;Much 
                as I like you, Amy,&quot; she said, wiping the mascara off her 
                face,&quot; I just don't trust you. As soon as you can, you'll 
                find an excuse to go back to your apartment, and then you'll slip 
                off your clothes, lock the door and try seducing me. I'm afraid 
                that's a temptation, I'd rather not have to face.&quot;<p>
                Amy blushed. That was precisely what she'd intended to do. She'd 
                even rehearsed her lines.<p>
                &quot;Please just accept that I don't want to have sex with you 
                anywhere but on the stage,&quot; Lucinda continued severely. &quot;My 
                body and soul belongs elsewhere. Sex is not something for me that 
                I intend to enjoy other than on the stage.&quot;<p>
                But Amy was obsessed. And she'd never been obsessed before. Not 
                since she was a schoolgirl and had a crush on her Chemistry teacher, 
                who when they'd finally got together turned out to be such a horrible 
                disappointment. But she was sure that Lucinda wouldn't be a disappointment. 
                And she found her thinking about the girl all the time, even when 
                she was enjoying sex with other people. In fact, one day on stage, 
                as Lucinda's tongue probed her vagina and her fingers her breasts, 
                she found herself saying out loud: &quot;I love you! I love you!&quot; 
                And then hoping no one had heard. Sex on stage was one thing. 
                Love was quite definitely another.<p>
                But she was in love. She even got to love Lucinda's appalling 
                taste in clothes. The very frumpishness and plainness of it was 
                in itself a cause for celebration. She would look longingly at 
                Lucinda, at her scrubbed face and tied-back hair, imagining the 
                two of them on her mattress, while she confessed her love and 
                divulged the truth of her diary-keeping. And then the two of them 
                would entwine lengthwise on the bed, arms and legs interlocked, 
                as she would confess all her secrets and her longings. And soon 
                the sun would rise and shine on the two of them, lying in serene 
                bliss, and Amy would never need to make love to anyone else. Well, 
                not for a few days anyway. <p>
                And her diary would read '1F. 10/10.Heavenly!'<p>
                And so it was, after an afternoon session, that Amy actually followed 
                Lucinda out of the building, keeping her distance so that Lucinda 
                wouldn't see her trailing her, although a girl like her, in her 
                thigh-length boots and skin-tight dress was not going to be the 
                sort to merge unnoticed in any crowd. And Lucinda led her on such 
                a long trail uptown. Several stops on the subway, past several 
                dismal blocks of decrepit apartments, around the back of a depressing 
                paint factory and then to a large Catholic church which Amy could 
                see Lucinda enter.<p>
                Amy very rarely went into churches. In fact, never at all as a 
                rule. And a Roman Catholic one. Well! What would her Calvinist 
                father have thought? But Amy hurried in and found herself alone. 
                It was forbidding and to Amy not at all welcoming. All around 
                were paintings and sculptures and carved cricifixes and row upon 
                row of pews, but no sign of Lucinda. She had vanished altogether. 
                Amy cursed herself. Clearly, Lucinda had seen Amy behind her and 
                had taken the opportunity to slip into a church just to get away 
                from her.<p>
                Amy left the church, lit a cigarette and sat on a bench in the 
                church grounds reflecting on the futility of her passion and making 
                plans for the rest of the day. Perhaps she'd go to a bar. Pick 
                up a couple of men. Have a good fuck somewhere. She noticed rather 
                a few people around her, mostly men, dressed in very poor quality 
                clothes. In fact, some of them were distinctly ragged. Couldn't 
                they afford anything better? But then she spotted a sign. 'Soup 
                Kitchen' it read. What did that mean? Was it some kind of rock 
                club or a strange kind of caf&eacute;.<p>
                But, no, it was actually a place for vagrants to gather to be 
                fed soup and bread and whatever. Fuck! How sordid! Amy sat on 
                the bench fascinated. Poverty was something she'd never really 
                known, and she'd often been disgusted by the sight of beggars 
                and the like on the subway. However, there was a bit of excitement 
                amongst the vagrants who all gathered by a door at the side of 
                the church. And then a rather elderly nun appeared carrying a 
                large cauldron, which she placed on the ground. Like feeding animals 
                at the zoo, thought Amy sourly, as a couple of other nuns emerged 
                behind the first nun carrying cups and some clear plastic bags 
                full of sandwiches.<p>
                The nuns weren't so bad looking. Quite thin, and from what Amy 
                could see, probably quite attractive underneath their gowns. And 
                then one of them looked up in her direction, and with a start 
                Amy now understood. That sweet face. That strange slightly beatific 
                smile. Lucinda was a nun. <p>
                Amy glanced at a carved crucifix over the church sign, in the 
                afternoon shadow of the church itself. Now she knew, and the sadness 
                and waste of it hurt her. Now she knew to whom Lucinda's body 
                and soul belonged.<p>
