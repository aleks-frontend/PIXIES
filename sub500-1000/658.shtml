              <p>I smile, feeling the gentle pulling of my leash as you guide 
                me between your legs. My body causing them to part as I crawl 
                up. Looking up into your eyes, the immense love and trust I have 
                for you shining from mine, I see the same emotions mirrored in 
                yours, as they crinkle in your slow, tender smile. Your large, 
                rough hand belies the gentleness of your touch, as you brush my 
                hair from my eyes, and caress my cheek lovingly. Your thumb traces 
                the outline of my lips, and I kiss the pad, before parting my 
                lips. You smile again, indulging me by sliding your thumb inside 
                my mouth. A soft moan from me, as I close my lips around your 
                thumb, and slowly begin to suck. Your fingers continuing to caress 
                my cheek, my eyes closing in the joy of your flavor, my tongue 
                gently flicking over and around your thumb, as you slowly push 
                my head down with your free hand. My cheek now laying against 
                your abdomen, I close my eyes, my lips barely brushing against 
                your pubic hair as I suck. Your hand continues to brush thru my 
                hair, still damp from my recent shower, pushing it back, lifting 
                it from my neck, your fingers gently massaging my neck and shoulders. 
                Feeling a tremor roll through your body, I open my eyes, locking 
                them to your semi-erect cock right in front of me. Moving my hand 
                slowly, teasingly up your leg, alternating rubbing with my fingertips, 
                and gently scratching with my long nails, I tease the inside of 
                your thigh. Causing you to open your legs a little wider with 
                a soft moan. I smile around your thumb, watching your cock harden 
                more, and jump slightly. My nails now caressing over your balls, 
                lifting them gently, as your hips pump up with another low moan. 
                You pull your thumb from my mouth suddenly, leaving it open and 
                empty. Moving my head only slightly, I allow my tongue to slip 
                out, trailing along the head of your cock. Your hand on my head 
                urges me forward, and I respond happily, my tongue sliding down 
                to circle the sweet ridge of your cock. Flicking gently, as I 
                cup your balls in my palm, pushing them closer to your body, my 
                thumb caressing the base of your thick manhood. A low whimper 
                of desire, need escapes me as I turn to my stomach between your 
                legs. My mouth now directly over your increasingly hard penis. 
                Lowering my head, I bury my nose in the pebbly skin of your balls, 
                before drawing it softly up the length of you, knowing how much 
                my Master loves this. My fingers continue to roll and gently squeeze 
                them, my breath is warm surrounding you, as I allow my little 
                finger to drop down, pressing the sweet spot between your balls 
                and ass. Rewarded by your sound of pleasure, and your hand on 
                the top of my head, I slide my tongue back out, and slowly begin 
                to lick your cock. Licking and caressing all sides, taking care 
                to trace the deep vein in the underside with the tip, as your 
                hips begin to pump. Your cock rubbing over my cheeks, my forehead, 
                my eyes with your thrusting, your hand holding me there, I slide 
                my other hand up to wrap my warm, soft fingers around you, pumping 
                slowly. My fingers alternately playing along the length of your 
                shaft, until I reach the sweet ridge again. Squeezing ever so 
                gently, a tasty little morsel of pre-cum oozes from your slit. 
                It glistens in the low lighting of our bedroom, and I close my 
                lips around the tip of your cock, and suck it out, moaning in 
                desire. I hear your low chuckle, you know how much I love your 
                cum, and your words as you tell me &quot;Ok pooh...it's yours 
                baby&quot;. </p>
              <p> Opening my mouth, taking your now fully erect cock into my mouth 
                is my way of saying Thank you Master. Both of your large hands 
                are now on my head, guiding me downward, not allowing me to stop 
                at the resistance of my throat. The fingers of one hand tangling 
                into my hair as I gag, drool beginning to leak from my mouth. 
                &quot;Yesss baabeeee...that's it&quot; you moan. You know how 
                I love your cock in my throat, gagging me...as you continue to 
                raise your hips and push my head. Your entire cock is now deep 
                in my mouth and throat, my nose buried in your pubic hair, as 
                you move one hand to my collar, twisting it slightly, cutting 
                off all breathing chances. My tongue is flat along your cock, 
                drool is now pouring from my mouth, flowing down your balls to 
                your sweet ass. You grind your throbbing cock deeper into my throat, 
                not allowing me to breathe until you hear the sound you want....the 
                low moan that escapes with the last of my breath. You release 
                my collar, pulling my head up with the fingers that are still 
                tangled in my hair. &quot;Breathe kitten&quot; I take a long, 
                deep breath, filling my lungs with the sweet scent of you. My 
                fingers working along your balls, under them caressing, spreading 
                the wetness of my drool, as my little fingernail teases your tight 
                asshole. I hear your gasp, as you release the tightness of my 
                hair, now allowing me to move freely along your cock. Continuing 
                to tease your ass, my finger pushing against the tight muscles, 
                I flick and circle your thick delicious cock with my tongue, tightening 
                my lips and moving down to take you back into my throat. Sucking 
                deeply, my mouth extended with the width of you, I pull my little 
                finger back some, running it through the wetness from my drooling. 
                Now my tight lips begin the slow ascent up your cock until they 
                are closed around the ridge, only the fat head filling my mouth, 
                my tongue flicking and probing your slit for more pre cum. My 
                little finger breaching the tight outer muscles of your anus.....and 
                slowly sliding in. One again I am rewarded by your loud moan, 
                your hips raising off the bed in response to my finger entering 
                you, your cock pushing back deeply into my mouth with your motion. 
                Whimpering and drooling, I resume taking you with my sweet, hot 
                mouth. My little finger now pumping your ass with the same rhythm 
                as my mouth on your cock. Your breathing is fast, shallow, a bit 
                labored as I feel your hands move back to my head. Holding the 
                sides of my head as you pump and grind, fucking my mouth harder, 
                deeper, I feel the telling tightening of your balls against my 
                hand. I am moaning in desire, the need to taste you, yearning 
                to feel the first hot spurt of your cum fill my mouth. Ignoring 
                the aching in my jaws, I open my mouth as wide as I can, flicking 
                my tongue against the throbbing veins, my fingers rolling and 
                teasing your balls, as my little finger continues to thrust deeply 
                into you, pressing that sweet spot inside......you pump up one 
                final time, your hands holding and pushing my head at the same 
                time, a low feral growl escaping you, and you explode into my 
                mouth and throat. OHHHHH the joy! that fills me with your cumming. 
                Moaning, swallowing, slurping, tears sliding down my cheeks as 
                you cock expands with your release. You resume soft pumping as 
                my fingers squeeze your balls gently, my mouth and tongue milking 
                your cock for all your sweet ambrosia. Allowing your hips to relax 
                back against the bed, your hands releasing my head, smoothing 
                my hair back again, you look down into my eyes. I'm continuing 
                to suck, slowly pulling my finger from your ass, as I then draw 
                up your length, releasing you from my mouth with an audible pop. 
                &quot;thank you Keeper, I love you&quot; I whisper, before bending 
                to tenderly lick you clean. &quot;I love you too pooh&quot;, you 
                whisper back, your hands still playing in my soft hair. When I 
                finish cleaning you, I feel you gently urging me up the bed, to 
                lay beside you. Turning onto my side, you turn also, spooning 
                up behind me, wrapping me in the warmth, the safety, the love 
                of your arms. Your now soft cock nestles between the cheeks of 
                my ass, as you nuzzle my ear. &quot;Good night my kitten&quot; 
                you say softly in my ear. &quot;nite Keeper&quot; I respond, and 
                we drift peacefully into sleep.</p>
