        <p>&quot;Melissa,&quot; I said politely as the waiter leaned above me 
          to refill my glass of water. &quot;Could I have your panties, please?&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Melissa was sitting across from me looking intently at her menu, the 
          light from the streetlamp outside casting a slight yellowish tint to 
          one side of her face. She didn't react at first, and I thought that 
          maybe she hadn't heard me. The waiter, on the other hand, clearly had: 
          he made a noise that sounded sort of like a strangled hiccup, the water 
          he'd been pouring splashing over onto the expensive white tablecloth. 
          Out of the corner of my eye I saw the people at the next table-a respectable, 
          well-dressed elderly couple- turn startled faces towards us.<br>
          Melissa glanced up at that moment. So she had heard me after all. She 
          just looked at me for a long moment, incredulous, not sure she had heard 
          me right. Finally, as if with great effort, she whispered, &quot;What 
          did you say?&quot;<br>
          <br>
          &quot;Hand me your panties,&quot; I repeated.<br>
          <br>
          Melissa sat silent, still, like a rock. Her face had gone very white, 
          the ruby red of her slightly-parted lips a stark contrast to her pallor. 
          Her menu slowly slipped out of her grasp and slid down to her lap. The 
          waiter stood by the table gaping, frozen in mid-movement. The noise 
          of conversation around us seemed to fade away, the patter of raindrops 
          on the window beside me loud in the sudden silence.<br>
          <br>
          &quot;Melissa,&quot; I finally said, in a voice that was quiet but demanded 
          obedience. &quot;I don't want to have to repeat myself again. Give me 
          your panties.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          She dropped her gaze, her eyes looking down at the table, her face slowly 
          flushing red. Everyone was looking at her now, like vultures almost, 
          watching, waiting for her to do something. For a long moment, nobody 
          moved. I was almost sure, then, that I had lost her, that she wouldn't 
          obey after all. All of a sudden, Melissa took a deep breath. Then, biting 
          down on her lower lip, still looking down at the table in front of her, 
          she raised her ass slightly off her chair and began hiking her dress 
          up.</p>
        <p>I heard the people at nearby tables release their breaths in a collective 
          sigh. The waiter had stepped back, his eyes bugging out as Melissa pulled 
          her long black evening dress higher and higher, baring those lovely 
          long legs, until it was almost all the way up to her crotch. She reached 
          underneath and pulled down her little black panties, slid them down 
          to her ankles and daintily, casually, over her sexy high-heeled sandals. 
          She stood up, then, her face expressionless, wadded the flimsy transparent 
          material into a little ball, threw it in my face, and walked out of 
          the restaurant. I have to hand it to the girl: she walked out with her 
          head high.<br>
          I scrambled to my feet and went after her as soon as I'd recovered my 
          wits, leaving behind me a loud buzz of sudden shocked conversation. 
          The waiter was still standing transfixed, his mouth hanging open, and 
          I almost knocked him down in my hurry. By the time I got out of the 
          front door, she was gone. It was raining hard, now, cold fat heavy drops 
          that streamed through the weak cones of yellow light of the street lamps, 
          splattering into the puddles on the sidewalk, stinging where they hit 
          bare skin. The narrow street was deserted. Faint in the distance, barely 
          audible over the noise of the rain on the rooftops, I could hear the 
          clicking of high heels on concrete. I broke into a run after that sound, 
          ignoring the cold rain, ignoring the maitre d's shouts behind me.</p>
        <p>I caught up with her soon enough, grabbed her arm, turned her to face 
          me. She was drenched, her wet hair plastered around her face; I don't 
          think I looked much better myself. A little droplet of rain dangling 
          off the tip of her nose made her look strangely vulnerable. Yet in her 
          eyes I saw only anger, a white-hot fury at the humiliation I had thrust 
          upon her.<br>
          She drew back her arm to slap me. I saw it coming, but made no attempt 
          to dodge: this much I owed her for what she had done for me. It staggered 
          me when it landed, pain flashing where her ring mashed against my lip. 
          I felt a salty warmth at the edge of my tongue.<br>
          &quot;You,&quot; she hissed at me. &quot;You fucking bastard!&quot;</p>
        <p>I grabbed her then, kissed her hard, her tongue thrusting hungrily 
          into my mouth in response. I pulled her into a dark alley off to the 
          side, pushed her roughly up against a wall, jerked her sodden dress 
          up to her waist and shoved a finger into her pussy. I heard her moan, 
          her breath coming in shallow gasps, her pussy hot, wet, ready. With 
          trembling fingers I fumbled at the zipper on my pants, pulled out my 
          aching hard cock and thrust savagely into her.<br>
          The rain poured on around us, unrelenting.<br>
