        <p>Crickets. Humidity. The smell of long-damp soil. No breeze, not a fucking 
          wisp of a break from the summer heat. The stars overhead seemed to melt 
          in the sky, running down to the horizon, and stream towards them in 
          a great obnoxious sweaty glob of pure incandescent energy. He was always 
          appreciative of her drug connections for moments like this.</p>
        <p> They were sitting on the stone next to the altar. Embrioled in a game 
          of &quot;who moves first loses&quot;, they began earlier on the altar, 
          side by side, but his touch of only his arm on her was not enough for. 
          As the ensuing rounds of the game unfolded, she lay a leg on him, then 
          sat on his middle, until he could take no more. Where they lay now, 
          on the stone floor, near the altar, her on his lap anew, was where he 
          had tossed her. But she held firm, she had always held firm, and she 
          pulled him down with her. Too hot was his complaint, but she knew he 
          could be cajoled into raising his....... level of temperature temperment. 
          Eyes locked, she surprised him with a question, out of the blue.</p>
        <p> &quot;How will we end?&quot;</p>
        <p> Perplexed, he asked her to better define her question.<br>
          &quot;No,&quot; she held firm, of course, &quot;Just answer, how will 
          we end?&quot;</p>
        <p> Sounding as if her were a teacher, scolding a penitent child, in fire 
          and brimstone manner, he stated for all the world to know, and she knew 
          it was coming......End? There is no end! Where we are, we have been, 
          and will be again. Where we have yet to go, we have alrea.....mmmpph!<br>
          Her mouth on his killed the speech: she had heard it before many times. 
          Many times. His &quot;It's Groundhog Day!&quot; approach to her questions 
          befuddled her sometimes. The time now was for something other than words. 
          So she led the way, like any good guide would. Sometimes he thought 
          the reason she &quot;guided&quot; so well, was the fact that she thought 
          for years as a child she would eventually get a penis of her own, without 
          some guy attached to it, but it attached to her!!</p>
        <p> Later..... he asked her the point of her question asked earlier. She 
          could not recall what it was, and it no longer mattered. He agreed, 
          and asked her to ask him anything. She did.</p>
        <p> &quot;When do we leave for the next mound of stone? I've read about 
          it, and I know, I know.... we've been to more exotic places, loftier 
          ones, more public ones, too.... but for some reason I just can't suss 
          out..... this one makes me...... nervous.&quot;</p>
        <p> He asked her why, and she could not focus on the reason, just that 
          this next trip was.......different. He told her that they would be leaving 
          in a few days, leaving this humid, God-aweful country behind. The Aztec 
          temples of Central Mexico was hot this time of year. They had been carved 
          out of the jungle for the tourists once discovered years ago. One thing 
          the locals had no way of considering, was this odd strain of tourist: 
          these two were just plain off the map of weird leaning more towards 
          fucking heartstoppingly shocking. As they lay against each other near 
          the upper altar in the temple, they could make out the moon just now 
          beginning to rise to the east. <br>
          <br>
          This....... Fate game of theirs....... began as an idea a few years 
          ago for them. What were they afraid of? They asked each other to find 
          out their deepest darkest fears, manifest them in the safest yet most 
          daring manner, and exorcize those fears once and for all. Be it in the 
          form of a loose ritual, formal ritual, carefree sex, ritual sex-magick.....or 
          a combination thereof, (reason being, acts they felt most comfortable 
          doing with each other) they had globe hopped, and never been caught 
          in the process. The ancient rock beauty of the Grand Canyon, the lofty 
          stones of Machu Picchu, the view from the Great Wall, the well constructed 
          wonders of Giza, the sheer risk of Mecca, the rough soil of Vatican 
          Hill, Stonehenge.....connections..... disconnections.... reconnections.... 
          reawakenings....... it was slightly risky, oft times spiritually breath 
          taking, but never dull. </p>
        <p> They arrived at the next stop on their tour. Having dined, slept, 
          conducted an exploratory of each other, (as per their usual ritual in 
          a new hotel), dined again, and having conducted an exploratory of the 
          site, (security weak spots were found right off, they became quite confidant), 
          she made an odd comment he didn't get the full meaning of, &quot;What 
          a foreign stone pile!&quot;, then they dined again (the food was really 
          quite good, afterall) showered, slept.....awoke..... and made ready 
          for their &quot;visit&quot; to the mound of rocks. </p>
        <p> <br>
          In darkness, they made their way to the site. Dressed in construction 
          gear, they mingled with the night crew, and slowly made their way to 
          the concrete piles near the base of the structure. Sneaking from concrete 
          block to block, part of work being done in an attempt to save what she 
          had exclaimed was, &quot;What a foreign stone pile!&quot; they made 
          their way to it's base, and the entry nearby. This was the part they 
          both stressed the most: the actual breaking and entering of the &quot;breaking 
          and entering&quot; violation. To their surprise, the door was unlocked, 
          and they stepped inside. Looking up, he whispered for her to pinch him, 
          but she punched him in the arm instead. </p>
        <p> They stood in darkness, silent blackness. They had seen the photos, 
          and knew the stairwell was nearby. Having found it, they began their 
          way up the 294 steps to the belfry. After a long nervous climb, they 
          found themselves in the open aired pinnacle of the tower, ovrlooking 
          the village below. </p>
        <p> He smiled at her, but her back was to him. She was taking in the view: 
          seven bells surrounded them in a circle at the top of the tower. They 
          had been locked in place years ago, long silent. She turned slowly, 
          and the moon that had followed them from Mexico glimmered a smile from 
          her to him. He joined her, and laughed. They had made it, almost.</p>
        <p> The wind was not a factor. The circle was cast by these bells, hundreds 
          of years ago for them, he put his compass away in a deep pocket. Then 
          the pocket, and the clothing which housed said pocket, joined her clothes 
          on the marble bell tower's floor. He asked her, if she could have one 
          wish fulfilled, what that wish would be.</p>
        <p> &quot;I'd wish to hear these old bells ring again, even if only for 
          a second.&quot;, was her thought, but, instead she said, &quot;I wish 
          you would stop talking, and sit down. Now.&quot;<br>
          Her wish, his command. Hell, he was hoping she'd ask for that. They 
          began. Eyes locked, arms wrapped, she on his lap. Sexual energy being 
          released only momentarily, hers mixed with and becoming his, then channeled 
          inward, towards their center, combined. One energy, one power.... one. 
        </p>
        <p> In some worlds, they would be a High Priest and Priestess, Gods, perhaps. 
          In this world, they would, if caught, be called, charged, and convicted 
          of being sexual deviants in search of a new high, then summarily jailed. 
          Well, they lived much of the time between those two plains. More than 
          a bit left of center, they were in essensce, totally off any and all 
          known Earthly scales. </p>
        <p> Energy building, she looked into his eyes deeper, saw what she knew 
          was coming ........approaching them. And did not flinch. Did not slow. 
          Did not speak a word of warning. Allowed it to become her, consume her, 
          and be released from within her. And she saw that he saw, too. He knew. 
          And they moved quicker to join that moment of final convulsive comepleteness. 
          Join it, enhance it, guide it from the imaginary world, into this world. 
          And it came. </p>
        <p> She felt it, somehow. First from deep within her, then her enitire 
          body, engulfed by it's power, began shaking. He too, felt it coming. 
          They never slowed. Theye never closed their eyes. They continued their 
          pace, bringing it out from the deepest recesses of the beyond to the 
          here and now. </p>
        <p> Then...... she heard it. The bell behind her chimed as it loosed from 
          it's mounts and clapped to the marble floor, sliding by them both. She 
          saw the arch behind him collapse, and it's bell chime as it fell into 
          the darkness. Damn, we're good!, she thought. She looked back into his 
          eyes drawn by the powers deep winthin them, and saw what they said to 
          her: do not stop</p>
        <p>At the Grand Canyon, in the midst of their &quot;oneness&quot; ritual, 
          they saw, felt, sensed the rocks around them erode as the river carved 
          it's way down. At the lofty stones of Machu Picchu, momentarily, they 
          saw the holy men walking the stone paths towards them. At the Great 
          Wall, they smelled the food of the millions of travellers that had walked 
          by over the ages. At the pyramids of Giza, they could see the desert 
          below filled with many people, in ceremonial garb. At Mecca, they were 
          lucky to escape with their minds intact. At Vatican Hill, they sniffed 
          the collective knowledge of the Catholic church. At Stonehenge, they 
          felt, oddly, home.</p>
        <p> Her sensation of &quot;falling&quot; was telling her that something 
          was definitely amiss. She saw as she looked beyond him again, that the 
          horizon was moving, raising. He seemed to sense her distraction, and 
          quickened his pace. She closed her eyes momentarily just then, and then 
          knew. Knew it all was true. </p>
        <p> As they slowly were wisked by gravity from the tower's loft out into 
          the waiting darkness, he had an odd vision. Laying with her, years ago, 
          thinking of the huge rock overhang above them. If that decided to fall, 
          there would be no saving them. There would be no sign they had even 
          been there. Perhaps, a spot under the rock. Howdy, Fate. How the hell 
          are ya? He gave that rock a good slap that day.</p>
        <p> She focused on him.... she still held firm as they fell. Her last 
          thought..... their last meal, the canolis were delicious, and the wine 
          was unlike any wine she had ever tasted. Well.... except once, many 
          miles from here. They fell, being followed close behind by that great 
          white marble Tower of Fate. It was about to reset all their defaults. 
          No escaping this, she thought, why am I not afraid? What if I don't 
          find him the next time arou..... She felt him kiss her chest, saw the 
          horizon and the moon spin around them, and thought one last time, <br>
          &quot;.............falling.........&quot;</p>
        <p> He focused on her, still in his arms, still seeking that high that 
          they both seeked. Even while free falling out into.......... nothing. 
          Eternity. His thought..... of her, and the world's greatest marble bell 
          tower that would collapse on top of them at any moment. He thought of 
          the last thing he had said to her in this life. A question, of course, 
          fitting. He thought of the first question he would ask in his next life. 
          Have I got a long way..........to run, to find her again? He thought 
          of the time as a child he almost drowned in a pool, and recalled seeing 
          a newpaper clipping of his death (in his mind) as he fought for the 
          edge of the pool. He wondered how the accounts of this moment would 
          read in the press. But mainly.... he thought of her, and reached across 
          the dark span between them, and kissed her chest one final time......<br>

              <p><b>Strong Earthquake Rocks Pisa,<br>
                Leaning Tower Topples </b></p>
        <p>(PISA, Italia, Tuesday January 12 2012) </p>
        <p>ROME (Reuters) - A strong localized earthquake shook the area around 
          the <br>
          central Italian city of Pisa Tuesday that officials said was too much 
          for the city's <br>
          famous leaning tower. What had stood for over seven hundred years has 
          finally<br>
          given way. </p>
        <p>Officials at the National Geophysics Institute in Rome said the short 
          sustained <br>
          tremor hit just past midnight local time and registered between five 
          and six on <br>
          the 12-point Mercalli scale.</p>
        <p>The quake was felt by residents in Pisa province but local officials 
          said no lives <br>
          were reportedly lost in the tremor. Oddly, no other damage was found 
          anywhere <br>
          else in the surrounding area.</p>
        <p>The Civil Protection Department in Rome said the damage to the Leaning 
          <br>
          Tower of Pisa, one of Italy's most famous landmarks, was total in scope. 
          <br>
          Police and pathologists ceased the search of the tower's rubble today 
          for traces <br>
          of victims from the tower's fall. All tower workers have been accounted 
          for, and luckily, <br>
          the tremor occurred late at night when there were no tourists near the 
          tower.</p>
        <p>The 58-meter (189-foot) tower was begun in 1173 as a belfry for the 
          nearby <br>
          cathedral and has been listing to the south since its third story was 
          added <br>
          in 1274.</p>
        <p>The tower, built on spongy Tuscan subsoil, has been closed to the public 
          for <br>
          nearly 10 years for fear it may collapse.</p>
        <p>Last month workers began a new attempt to shore up the tower by fixing 
          giant <br>
          steel braces to the white marble monument as part of a project to coax 
          it<br>
          fractionally back toward the vertical.</p>
        <p>No plans have been made to resurrect the tower. A Church spokesman 
          said<br>
          the stones will remain where they have fallen. So there they will lay, 
          littering a three <br>
          acre portion of the cathedral grounds, in some places piled high as 
          ten meters.</p>
