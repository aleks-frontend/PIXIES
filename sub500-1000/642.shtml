        <p>The bitch has escaped again - </p>
        <p> it was after midnight; I thought it was quiet, I hadn't heard any 
          of her usual restless sighing or the sound of her masturbating or singing 
          some insane tune to herself. The cuffs hung from the end of her bed, 
          the sheets had been pulled straight, and the wet tissues were in the 
          little waste-bin, she was a tidy slut if nothing else. <p>
          The contents of her wardrobe didn't look as though they had recently 
          been disturbed, she had probably gone out naked again, like she did 
          in the summer. Only this was late November, it was a blustery night, 
          not very cold but a blowing drizzle was very unpleasant. I stopped to 
          think, I felt pretty sure she would be on the beach, if she were I'd 
          damn soon find her there. I went out into this wild night and crossed 
          the road, down the stone steps onto the beach, the tide had probably 
          just started to come in and spray was blowing inshore as the waves crashed 
          onto the chilly sand. I set off north, but after a couple of hundred 
          yards I had a feeling that I should turn back, which I did, and walked 
          with the wind at my back. As I passed under the pier, I suddenly saw 
          a dark shape flitting in the shallow water, from one of the iron pillars 
          to the next. I stood quietly, and waited. Then I saw her peeping from 
          behind the pillar, she was indeed nude, her hair was soaked and some 
          clung to her body in strands, some of it whipped in the wind, and even 
          though I couldn't distinguish her face, who else would be out here naked 
          with hair down past her waist. I called to her: &quot;Come on Godiva, 
          your horse has bolted!&quot; I heard her giggle, she stepped towards 
          me, wading with the sea up to her knees, I could make out her slim tall 
          body, her dark nipples and her dark pubic hair, finally her face, with 
          those enormous dark eyes. She came close, made no attempt to escape 
          again, she looked at me and said: &quot;I'll come home if you make love 
          to me.&quot; I said if she came home I would definitely make love to 
          her. &quot;NO!&quot; she pouted, &quot;do it here, - now!&quot; I said: 
          &quot;It's bloody midnight and it's raining, you silly bitch.&quot; 
          She grabbed me in those long slim arms, wrapped her legs around me, 
          and we fell into the waves. I fought her off, but only for a moment, 
          she had pulled down my track-suit bottoms, she crammed my cock into 
          her vagina before it was properly hard, and pulled me into her. And 
          again, and again, until I couldn't resist fucking her; when she felt 
          my come pulse into her, she screamed right in my ear, I gave her a smack 
          in the face, though quite gently in fact, and yanked out my cock. Now 
          I was drenched, I was covered in sand, and now it really was pouring 
          with rain. She smiled happily at me, &quot;Home now, please.&quot; she 
          said. We stumbled up the beach, up the steps onto the dark and deserted 
          road, crossed over, I fumbled in my wet pockets for the key, got the 
          door open. She said: &quot;Just a moment longer...&quot; and stood in 
          the rain to let some of the sand wash off her exquisite body. I stood 
          entranced, and as, magically, the full moon appeared between the clouds, 
          she was lit by its glow. She was breathtaking. Abruptly the rain seemed 
          to stop, her arms fell to her sides, quietly she followed me in; upstairs 
          in the candle-lit bathroom I washed her long hair and her slim body. 
          I wrapped her in a towel, carried her into the bedroom, laid her on 
          the bed. I left a single candle burning, and as I left the room I turned 
          to see her buckling the cuffs onto her ankles and around her thin waist. 
          As I closed the door I saw her lean over to blow out the candle, so 
          it was now utterly dark.<p>
          I looked at my clock, it was exactly 3 a.m., I heard through the wall 
          her restless sighing, I knew she was masturbating, and I knew that in 
          a while she would start to sing to herself one of her insane tunes. 
          To the wall I whisper: &quot;I love you</p>
