              <p>Jack had seen no one else on the nature trail all day. It was 
                early afternoon on a Tuesday, a day when he was sure that there 
                could be no other nature watchers out this far into the woods, 
                much less in the park area at the entrance of the preserve. He 
                had scheduled some time off from work to pursue what had once 
                been only a weekend hobby, but which now consumed the better part 
                of his free time: bird watching. In the past three years, he had 
                catalogued over 300 varieties of bird species, but his catalogue 
                remained far from complete.<p>
                He had heard reports of certain rare species being seen in the 
                wooded area of the preserve, one report in particular gaining 
                his interest. A friend had told of seeing a White-breasted Sap-sucker 
                while walking along the trail, but he had lost track of it after 
                only a few minutes of following. What had made it more difficult 
                to track at the time of the sighting, was the fact that a number 
                of families and individuals were in the area, forcing the shy 
                creature to retreat deeper into the woods. The bird had been sighted 
                again at another time in the same area, according to his friend. 
                These reports had led Jack to the conclusion that the bird might 
                be nesting in the area. Of course, the times of the sightings 
                were always occurring when the most people were in the area, so 
                Jack figured that he needed to be there when the fewest people 
                were around. And he could not have picked a better day.<p>
                He casually walked along the trail, his eyes scanning the branches 
                of the trees far ahead; he wanted to be sure that he was some 
                distance away, if the Sap-sucker should appear, thus making his 
                presence less known as he followed its lead. The overhanging branches 
                became denser the further along he went, shortening the view ahead 
                of him. He crouched down some as he walked, trying to adjust the 
                view, but to little avail. He decided to turn back and try another 
                trail; but as he was turning around, he heard a rustling in an 
                area not far off. Crouching low, he could see through the thicket 
                what appeared to be a sunlit clearing not more than 50 feet from 
                the edge of the trail. He began to look for some space between 
                the trees which would provide him a path toward the clearing.<p>
                Pushing some underbrush to one side with his hand, he discovered 
                an opening which clearly marked an old trail through the woods. 
                It was covered with a blanket of fallen leaves, with no noticeable 
                undergrowth and very few branches and twigs that could crack under 
                foot and give away his presence. He slowly made his way along 
                the path, which began to turn toward where he had seen the clearing. 
                As he made the turn, he could now see that the path did indeed 
                lead to the nearby clearing. He approached the opening cautiously, 
                and stopped just short of entering the clearing to avoid revealing 
                himself if something should happen to be there.<p>
                The clearing itself was wide and grassy, its edges shaded by overhanging 
                limbs thick with new spring foliage. Jack scanned the upper branches 
                all around and over head. Then he heard the rustling again, but 
                it seemed now to be coming from nearer the ground on the far side 
                of the clearing. Peering into the shadows of the limbs across 
                the way, he caught a glimpse of the creature whose rustlings had 
                drawn him here; the incredibleness of the sight forced him to 
                use the binoculars to verify what he now saw: a woman sitting 
                on the ground between two large roots of an enormous tree. She 
                was leaning back against its thick trunk, almost engulfed within 
                the recesses of it. She had on a flowery sun dress which buttoned 
                down in the front. Several of the buttons were undone, and the 
                shoulders of the dress spread open and just barely clung to her 
                upper arms. Jack could tell that she was bra-less, the upper hems 
                of the dress being held up only by her well-formed breasts.<p>
                The woman&#8217;s knees were bent and her legs parted several 
                inches. She had pulled the lower hem up to her waist to allow 
                one of her hands to be inserted between her legs and into her 
                crotch. With the binoculars, Jack could now see that she was moving 
                her hand slowly up and down over her crotch. Suddenly, she seemed 
                to shiver, causing the upper hem of the dress to finally fall 
                from where it had been hanging, fully exposing her breasts with 
                their nipples hardened. Jack himself began to shiver with excitement, 
                hardly believing what he was seeing. Also, he could barely hold 
                the binoculars straight to keep from missing a single second of 
                this precious find. As he followed closely the rhythms of her 
                hand, his excitement made its way into his own crotch. There he 
                could feel the tight swelling within his jeans, aching to be released. 
                But not yet, not until he could move in closer without being seen 
                by her, and still see her without the aid of the binoculars which 
                were becoming cumbersome and unsteady.<p>
                Jack looked to either side to see which would be the most concealed 
                way around the clearing. He knew that he could have just walked 
                over to her and introduced himself, and maybe she would allow 
                him to be her attentive audience. However, announcing himself 
                too soon might embarrass her and cause her to run away. After 
                all, why else would she have come out this far to such a remote 
                area, if but to merged herself undisturbed in sheer ecstasy with 
                the natural beauty and wildness around her. Jack could understand 
                this, having himself felt occasionally the urge to come out here, 
                strip naked and roll around in the fallen leaves and undergrowth. 
                So as to not ruin her moment, he carefully crept along the ground 
                under the branches, making his way around the clearing&#8217;s 
                perimeter to just within 30 feet of where the woman sat. She showed 
                no sign of detecting his presence, being too wrapped up in the 
                sensations which, Jack thought, must be increasing, since she 
                had her eyes tightly closed while her whole body rubbed up and 
                down against the tree trunk, her free hand gripping the large 
                root next to her for support. Or, was she gripping it and running 
                her hand along it, with the image in her mind of some large male 
                member, hard, stiff and smooth, being readied for the chance to 
                be slipped between her bare legs and pressed against the burning 
                lips of her vagina.<p>
                Jack lifted the strap from around his neck and laid the binoculars 
                on the ground. He then knelt on both knees and unfastened the 
                snap and gently drew down the zipper of his jeans. He pushed them 
                down his thighs, and discovered that his now erect penis had poked 
                its way through the slit of his briefs. He was ready to start 
                stroking it where it was, but felt that the brightness of the 
                light colored briefs might blow his cover in the darkness under 
                the hanging branches. So he slipped these down as well, his cock 
                springing back up immediately, its head lightly tapping his belly.<p>
                The woman had slowed her movements, as though the electric sensations 
                which she had generated within her loins were beginning to subside. 
                But soon, she was moving her hand again, this time faster, causing 
                her body to rise and her back to arch, her head leaning back and 
                against the trunk. Her wide opened mouth emitted heavy pantings 
                and deep guttural moanings which rose in pitch to soft whelpings. 
                Jack&#8217;s shaking hand was closely wrapped around his throbbing 
                cock, moving up and down its entire length; each time it reached 
                the bottom of the thick, 7 inch shaft, its fingers reached under 
                and tugged his now stiff balls, releasing them as his hand then 
                made its way back up to the head, swollen and polished. As Jack 
                continued to stroke himself, he felt a strong urge to jump up, 
                run over to the woman, crawl on top of her, and give her what 
                she obviously so desperately needed. The thought became especially 
                urgent, since the woman was now moving closer to the large root, 
                apparently ready to mount it for the final ride.<p>
                Jack stood up, his pants and briefs falling to his ankles, his 
                cock extending straight out and up, waving like a flag.<p>
                &#8220;Need some help,&#8221; he said in as calm a voice as he 
                could muster. The woman quickly pulled down the hem of her dress, 
                stood up and against the tree. She fumbled with the upper hems 
                of the dress, trying to get it up over her shoulders again, but 
                she could not seem to get it passed her erect nipples.<p>
                &#8220;What the f . . . ,&#8221; she said, but fell silent when 
                she caught sight of Jack&#8217;s almost perpendicular cock. She 
                let out a nervous and breathy laugh, a big grin forming on her 
                face. The grin then faded and her lips parted with a sigh. Her 
                chest heaved, and Jack could have sworn that he heard the fast 
                pounding of her heart. The corner of her mouth rose to a half 
                smile.<p>
                &#8220;Hey there,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Looks like you&#8217;re 
                the one who might need some help. You lost?&#8221;<p>
                &#8220;No,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;I was just walking along the 
                trail and happened upon this clearing, when I saw you. I didn&#8217;t 
                mean to disturb you, but I couldn&#8217;t help myself.&#8221;<p>
                &#8220;Obviously,&#8221; said the woman, stepping away from the 
                tree. &#8220;So, you come here often? Oh, listen to me, I sound 
                like I&#8217;m in a bar trying to pick a fella up.&#8221;<p>
                Jack felt his cock starting to go limp, so he grabbed it and tried 
                to revive it with more stroking.<p>
                &#8220;So,&#8221; she said, &#8220;what are you standing over 
                there for? The fun&#8217;s over here.&#8221;<p>
                She leaned back against the tree and let the top of her dress 
                fall down her arms again. Then she raised her skirt and reached 
                her hand under it, a large grin forming on her face.<p>
                &#8220;I thought I was alone out here,&#8221; she said, &#8220;figured 
                I&#8217;d do a little &#8216;solo flying&#8217; in the wild. Never 
                expected anyone would catch me. But here you are. Sure, I could 
                use some help, if you&#8217;re up to it.&#8221; She looked down 
                at Jack&#8217;s crotch and giggled, seeing him stroking faster, 
                desperately trying to get it up again. He bent over and began 
                frantically to slip off his shoes, pants and briefs. After they 
                were off, he casually walked across the clearing to where the 
                woman was, continuing the stroking. The nearer he got to her, 
                the bigger his erection became. He stepped inside the shade of 
                the tree and stood watching her rub between her thighs with one 
                hand, while with her other hand she gently squeezed and stroked 
                one of her breasts, all the while eyeing and smiling at him. She 
                then licked her lips and grinned. Jack pulled off his shirt and 
                threw it to the ground.<p>
                &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m up to it alright,&#8221; he said, as he approached 
                her, his cock once more at attention. He stood no more than a 
                foot from her, then reached down and began lifting the hem of 
                her dress. She raised her arms over her head, while Jack continued 
                bundling up the dress higher along her torso, until he was finally 
                able to lift the whole thing off her with one movement. She lowered 
                her arms and laid her hands on his shoulders, while he placed 
                his on her hips. He softly caressed her hips and waist; then reaching 
                around to her back, he pulled her to him. She raised herself up 
                to him on her toes, wrapping her arms around his neck. When their 
                lips met, she let out a deeper moan, as though Jack had just fed 
                her a mouthful of the most delicious dessert she had ever tasted.<p>
                Jack took a small step forward and pressed the woman against the 
                tree. In response, she lifted her leg and hugged his hip with 
                it, pulling him closer to her. They continued kissing passionately, 
                first one way, then another; neither of them could get enough 
                of the other&#8217;s lips, to get the full taste of them. Jack 
                reached under the woman&#8217;s buttocks, groping with his fingers 
                to find her other moistened lips. The woman took Jack&#8217;s 
                groping to mean that he was trying to lift her into position for 
                penetration. She reciprocated by clinging to his neck and hoisting 
                herself up, raising both legs and wrapping them around his waist. 
                Jack, realizing what she was trying to do, proceeded to place 
                both of his hands under her buttocks and lift her crotch to his 
                belly, sliding her up the side of the tree trunk. Then, as her 
                legs gripped his waist tighter, he gently lowered her, adjusting 
                his pelvis in order to aim and work his cock into the opening 
                which she had so carefully prepared.<p>
                As the head of his cock sunk into her, she let out a louder moan 
                but without separating her mouth from his. She raised herself 
                slightly, feeling the penetration acutely; the piercing of her 
                vagina was almost too much to bear (although it was eagerly awaited), 
                causing her to almost want to escape its probing. But, as the 
                weight of her body and the slipperiness of the tree trunk against 
                her sweaty back caused her to sink back down, she felt the cock 
                slide deeper into her and, overwhelmed by its complete submersion, 
                consequently tightened the grip of her arms and legs around Jack&#8217;s 
                own sweaty body.<p>
                Jack grabbed the tree trunk with his hands and, pressing his knees 
                into it, began rocking his hips in an upward motion, pounding 
                the woman harder. She could not maintain the hold of her lips 
                on Jack&#8217;s, so she pulled her head away from his and let 
                out a grunt, then began panting and whining in rhythm with the 
                accelerated pumping action of Jack&#8217;s cock. Jack gripped 
                the tree harder and poured his whole might into the endeavor. 
                The heat of the air under the tree was stifling, as their bodies 
                were becoming drenched with sweat. Then a cool breeze suddenly 
                appeared, and stirred the branches over head. Jack felt the rush 
                of the breeze against his back, like someone had splashed cool 
                water over him. The breeze whipped around, and now the woman could 
                feel it too, the wetness of her skin enhancing its coolness. Jack 
                began to slow his movements, separating his body slightly from 
                the woman&#8217;s; in the space between, the breeze flowed over 
                the fronts of their bodies, invigorating them. Jack pressed his 
                body against hers once more, planting his lips firmly on her neck; 
                he sucked and licked the moisture trickling down from her brow 
                along her cheek and to her neck.<p>
                As they both shivered from the approaching orgasmic rush, their 
                lips locked together once more. The exertion had begun to weaken 
                their frames; Jack&#8217;s knees were shaking, and the woman&#8217;s 
                legs were losing their hold. The breeze was picking up force, 
                and the sunlight in the clearing was fading. Dark clouds began 
                forming over head. Jack, feeling his legs starting to give, swung 
                himself around, walked to a point just beyond the edge of the 
                overhanging branches, and fell to his knees. He laid the woman 
                on her back and continued pumping, but more slowly and with longer 
                strokes.<p>
                As the wind blew harder, thunder could be heard from the thick 
                clouds which now covered the entire sky. As the wind quieted down 
                momentarily, drops of rain struck the ground around Jack and the 
                woman. Jack felt the drops hitting him in the back, then more 
                drops, until the rain was coming down in a steady spray. The woman 
                pushed against Jack&#8217;s shoulders and, using her own body 
                as leverage, rolled him over onto his back. He continued to pump 
                her, but now she was adding to the movement herself. She lifted 
                herself up and erect, her fingertips pressing into Jack&#8217;s 
                chest, her body continuing to rise and fall. Her hair was now 
                slick with rain, the drops streaming down her chest and arms and 
                dripping from her breasts. Jack cupped both breasts with his hands 
                and squeezed and stroked them, his cock still slipping in and 
                out of her warm pussy. She was riding him harder now like he was 
                some wild bull, twirling her head around and slinging her long 
                drenched hair from side to side. She began to make sounds with 
                her voice like those of some wild exotic bird, crying and cawing, 
                wooping and crowing, then screeching. Jack responded by imitating 
                the sounds himself. She let out one last cry, then collapsed onto 
                Jack&#8217;s chest. Panting heavily, she moaned softly for a few 
                minutes.<p>
                She looked at Jack&#8217;s face and ran her hand over his wet 
                brow. Once more, she pressed her lips to his, savoring the remaining 
                morsels. The rain began to slacken to a sprinkle. She pulled herself 
                up and pushed a strand of hair from her face.<p>
                &#8220;What did you come out here for anyway?&#8221; she said, 
                laughing now, &#8220;other than to find a good fuck.&#8221;<p>
                &#8220;I was looking for this rare bird,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;the 
                White-breasted Sap-sucker. But I guess I&#8217;ll never find it 
                now.&#8221;<p>
                &#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;think again, honey. I&#8217;m 
                white breasted, and I just sucked the sap right out of your tree 
                trunk.&#8221;<p>
                They both laughed. Then Jack began to think: the friend who claimed 
                to have seen the Sap-sucker was always joking with him about his 
                obsession with bird watching. Perhaps he had found what he was 
                looking for after all; or rather, it had lured him in and snared 
                him.<p>
                &#8220;So, I guess you found me then,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What 
                are you going to do with me now? Put me in a cage?&#8221;<p>
                &#8220;No,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;you belong in the wild. Wild 
                I found you, and wild I&#8217;ll keep you.&#8221;<p>
                &#8220;Just don&#8217;t forget to keep me fed from time to time,&#8221; 
                she said.<p>
                &#8220;Oh, you can be sure to get plenty of feedings from me,&#8221; 
                said Jack. &#8220;Just remember to open wide.&#8221;<p>
