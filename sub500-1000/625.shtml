<p>Hi everyone, I&#146;m Jillian and I&#146;m from Surfer&#146;s Paradise 
          on the Gold coast in Australia. I&#146;ve only recently found Pixie&#146;s 
          pages but I just luuurrrve them. The other girls at work and I am wasting 
          more time than we should reading stories, and now we&#146;ve actually 
          decided to start sending them in ourselves. We&#146;re finding it hard 
          to make them up, so we said we&#146;d just tell some true stories about 
          ourselves. It&#146;s funny how you can recognise your friends&#146; 
          writing styles. I read a story by &#147;Elouise&#148; which sounded 
          so familiar I&#146;ll have to ask my friend Louisa if it was actually 
          her. (Duhh!) Anyway, if it is you babe, here&#146;s my story about pretty 
          much the same thing. Enjoy it girls (and I know the guys will as well, 
          even though they might find out some of our secrets).</p>
        <p><br>
          Have you ever wondered how hard it is for a girl? If we just motor up 
          to some cute man and ask for sex, we must be sluts. If we don&#146;t 
          make things really obvious, we often as not miss out (and end up spending 
          lonely time in the shower trying to get rid of that heavy feeling inside 
          which stops a girl from sleeping). Thank God for the occasional boyfriend 
          who hangs around for longer than a couple of months. By then he should 
          at least have an inkling of when we do or don&#146;t want some action, 
          and also when those days are that action is definitely out of the question. 
          The other benefit of keeping a guy for a while is that you can try some 
          of those things that you&#146;d consider too risky early in a relationship. 
          I&#146;d always been curious about my last remaining &#147;virgin&#148; 
          territory, but I didn&#146;t want some short-term lover walking out 
          and forever referring to me as the &#147;up-the-butt-chic&#148;.</p>
        <p>Gareth was my current squeeze, and he was an attentive, considerate 
          and gentle lover. When you are going to offer your bottom for the first 
          time, you are naturally a little hesitant, and you want a man who will 
          take his time. To be honest though, since the girls at work had all 
          been talking about anal sex so much, I was starting to feel a degree 
          of urgency. I didn&#146;t worry too much because the general opinion 
          was that it was something that all guys were desperate for. The girls 
          were always laughing about how their partners were always trying to 
          bring the subject up, or would casually brush, bump, tickle, or get 
          a bit &#147;lost&#148; in the dark and try to &#147;accidentally&#148; 
          penetrate their little winking eyes. <br>
          My friend Jeannie kept us all giggling with tales of her new man, Mick, 
          who tried to penetrate her date with his nose whenever he was down for 
          lunch at her front door. We all thought it was pretty funny too when 
          we asked Kerry, the youngest of our group where the strangest place 
          she&#146;d had sex was. &#147;Ummm, up my bum actually&#133; &#145;coz 
          Dave was so insistent.&#148; (Needless to say, Kerry is a true blonde&#133;.heck, 
          so am I.) What really kept making me so curious was that even though 
          a few who had tried it didn&#146;t like it, those who did like it couldn&#146;t 
          stop going on about how fantastic it was. They couldn&#146;t properly 
          describe what was so good, they just kept saying, &#147;Try it sometime 
          and see for yourself&#148;. Then they&#146;d gaze off into the distance 
          with this flushed expression on their face. I couldn&#146;t stand not 
          being in on the secret any longer, and I was going to have to use Gareth 
          to gain entry to the club.</p>
        <p>Well girls,whoever said, &#147;you can lead a horse to water, but you 
          can&#146;t make it drink,&#148; must have been thinking about Gareth. 
          I never realized just how hard it might be to get a guy to fuck my little 
          ass. I&#146;d decided that today was going to be the day long before 
          we got to bed. I&#146;d been thinking about it all morning and my little 
          cunny was pretty much saturated. I also had this strange expectant feeling 
          &#147;back there&#148; which I knew could only be filled one possible 
          way. <br>
          I&#146;d taken Gareth down to the beach for a nice long afternoon walk, 
          and I knew he hadn&#146;t missed the sight of the dark wet patch seeping 
          out from the fork of my pale green bikini bottoms. Not only was it clearly 
          visible, but I kept catching delicate wafts of my own scent. Gareth 
          had to be catching them as well, and I knew that my smell turned him 
          on. Out of the corner of my eye, I watched the growing bulge in Gareth&#146;s 
          straining Lycra Speedos and I knew it was time to head home. </p>
        <p>I live in a nice condo on a canal just off the Nerang River, and in 
          the afternoon the sun shines into my loft bedroom which overlooks the 
          water. It gives a lovely soft warm quality of light for lovemaking, 
          but it&#146;s still bright enough to give you a good view of the working 
          parts. By the time we&#146;d got through the door and up the stairs, 
          Gareth and I had managed to shed our skimpy swimsuits, and we fell onto 
          the bed for a tasty prelude of oral sex. This had been part of my cunning 
          plan, because I knew that while G was down there, I could give him an 
          eyeful of my own squinting eye! Being a normal red-blooded male, he&#146;d 
          surely try to avail himself of its potential. This would save me having 
          to ask for &#147;it&#148; and consequently risking the possibility of 
          looking like some hungry-arsed anal-loving slut. Well, as they say, 
          &#147;the best laid plans etc etc&#148;. <br>
          While G was doing his best work down there, I was almost oblivious. 
          I was too busy with my own plans. G was lying on his back while I crouched 
          over him and sucked on his schlonger. He had a very lovely, thick, circumcised 
          number, and it was only now when I knew that it might soon be up my 
          donut that I realised just how big he really was. &#147;Hmmm, stop worrying 
          girl and concentrate on the immediate issues,&#148; I told myself. I 
          figured that this position was giving Gareth the best possible view 
          of my delicate little &#147;chocolate starfish&#148;, and he&#146;d 
          surely take the bait. Well, to his credit he just kept giving me the 
          most tremendous head and never strayed from my clitty or labs at all. 
          Maybe if I could just get him to shift a smidgeon backwards? I lifted 
          my top half up a bit and arched my back more while pulling slightly 
          forwards. I knew this was pulling my date closer to his tongue, and 
          I pushed my legs wider to open things up a bit. I couldn&#146;t believe 
          it. He pulled his chin down and s! hifted away from my freckle. What 
          was going on here? I started circling my bottom round and round to keep 
          drawing my freckle within his reach. Every time I did, he seemed to 
          avoid it again. <br>
          Oh well. Time for a change of strategy. I turned and pulled him up, 
          and I knelt in front of him in his favourite doggie-position. I reached 
          behind with both hands and roughly pulled to spread my cheeks as wide 
          as possible. This time however, I arched slightly lower than usual, 
          and I realized that if I pulled my knees slightly closer in than usual, 
          then my buttocks would open a little wider. Surely he couldn&#146;t 
          fail to miss now. I felt Gareth rubbing his head down along the slit 
          between my legs, all the way from my hood to my fork. I knew his penis 
          would now be slick, and I braced myself for&#133;..nothing! Well not 
          quite nothing, as he had slipped into my cunny with a very wet sounding 
          slurp. He started his usual energetic pumping, and although this would 
          normally get me off, today it was very much the consolation prize. I 
          was really wet though, and as he slapped in and out, I could feel the 
          hot moisture of my juice running out of my cunny and down my legs. I 
          was also aware of some ! of it spilling upwards and I knew that it was 
          wetting my arsehole. In my mind, I could see it there, boldly on offer 
          and yet neglected. Knowing it was now glistening, I started trying to 
          both clench it and push it open to see if this would catch G&#146;s 
          eye. Sadly, it seemed that the only result of my exertions was to bring 
          G to a peak, and he nearly climaxed right then. No you don&#146;t , 
          I thought, and I realized that a new tack was required. I dropped so 
          that I was lying on my side and I pulled my top leg up and open. Gareth 
          dropped down behind me and I knew he was now seeing my spot in all its 
          splendour. I could also feel that this position actually let me push 
          my date open even more. Surely he couldn&#146;t resist. Surely the fleshy 
          pink crater had to look like ground zero. Surely it would act like a 
          magnetic homing device that would draw his penis to it.</p>
        <p>Splash! Back into my cunt he plunged, and this was now really frustrating 
          me. Did I need some bloody giant neon light on my back, pointing to 
          my freckle, and flashing &#147;Fuck here!&#148;? Sure he was trying 
          hard, but that slurp,slurp,slurp was really getting to me. Maybe I was 
          just going to have to demand it. Then I got worried. What if he really 
          hated anal sex? Had he realised what I had been up to and been politely 
          ignoring it? Did he think less of me? What was I to do?</p>
        <p>Thankfully &#147;reason&#148; then left me and &#147;cunning&#148; 
          swung back into action. What I needed to try was one last change of 
          position. Without a word, I swept out from beneath him, and lay back 
          as if in classical missionary position. As Gareth moved towards me, 
          I pulled my legs up as high as I could and tried to roll even further 
          back. Damn hanging my legs over his shoulders; they were so far past 
          my ears if I got them any further back now they&#146;d be over my own 
          shoulders! I knew the afternoon sun streaming in the window was spotlighting 
          my holes; could he possibly resist now?</p>
        <p>Fuck! He&#146;d stuck it up my cunt again. I wanted to scream out, 
          &#147;Ass stupid, Ass. Stick it up my ass!&#148; Garth was totally oblivious 
          and pumped away without a word. In exasperation, I pulled as tight as 
          I could, and suddenly G was spurting into me. He gasped and went to 
          pull out, and as he did, he shot a load all over my wretched arsehole. 
          Then I noticed his face!!! He was kneeling in front of me, but his gaze 
          was locked between my legs. I didn&#146;t need to be Einstein to realize 
          that he wasn&#146;t staring at my slot, but about two inches lower. 
          Was this a minor success after all?</p>
        <p>Gareth started stammering and trying to say something. He was umming 
          and ahhhing and couldn&#146;t seem to get the words out. Then I heard 
          the most magnificent thing&#133;.. &#147;Umm Jilly, I don&#146;t really 
          know how to ask this, but I&#146;d really like to try anal sex. You 
          don&#146;t mind do you? Um, we don&#146;t have to if you don&#146;t 
          want to&#133;.but I can&#146;t help it! I&#146;ve been transfixed by 
          your hole all afternoon. Can we try?&#148;</p>
        <p>And that dear girls is how I got Gareth around to trying it. The story 
          about how we actually did do it will have to be &#147;Part Two&#148;. 
          (I think my boss has noticed that I&#146;m flushed, breathing deeply 
          and typing furiously; I&#146;d better get back to work before I stick 
          to the seat.) Let&#146;s just say it wasn&#146;t quite as easy as I 
          thought it might be, but I&#146;m definitely a convert.</p>
        <p>Love Jillian.</p>
        <p>(PS Gareth is past history, so if anyone &#147;willing to start at 
          the bottom&#148; is ever travelling through the Gold Coast, drop me 
          a line to jilliand@pixies-place.net If you sound like my type, I might 
          even give you a wink!)</p>
