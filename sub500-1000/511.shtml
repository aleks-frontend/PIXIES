              <p>Snow White was feeling wretched and miserable as she lay naked 
                in the shadows of the tall forest trees, as well she might after 
                her unexpected rape at the hands of the forester. It had seemed 
                such a jolly idea at first when he suggested walking into the 
                woods with her ostensibly to show her what he did for a living, 
                and the fact it was sanctioned by her usually unsympathetic stepmother 
                and guardian made it an especial treat. But then he turned on 
                her, beating her about the face, pulling off her clothes, and 
                then forcing himself on her. At first, Snow White had no idea 
                what was happening to her, but it soon became clear when he pulled 
                down his britches, pulled out his erect penis and violated her. 
                Whether the rape was to be all that she was to endure she didn't 
                know, but in the struggle she managed to loosen his grip and ran 
                deep into the woods.<p>
                She had no idea where she was or whether the forester was still 
                running after her, but the pain she felt from his punches and 
                the stinging, aching pain between her legs had weakened her so 
                much that after a while all she could do was collapse onto the 
                bracken, a trail of blood coursing down her inside thighs. Perhaps 
                she was saved by the torrential rain that started within minutes 
                of her escape. The forester's dog would probably have lost her 
                scent, but it served to make her even more miserable. Her long 
                hair was thoroughly damp and streaks of rain slid over her pale 
                skin. Yet another misery in a thoroughly miserable life, which 
                had steadily become worse since her father had died in suspicious 
                circumstances.<p>
                Snow White lay in the damp undergrowth for hours, as she gradually 
                recuperated from her pains. The early morning sun eventually rose 
                in the sky, and shafts of light penetrated through the canopy 
                of leaves above her, revealing to anyone passing by, a wretched 
                sight as she lay prostrate on the ground, hardly conscious but 
                not able to fall fully asleep. Her face was damp with tears, as 
                much as her hair was damp from the rain and her body from the 
                early morning dew.<p>
                And this is how Snow White was found by the seven dwarves who 
                lived in a decrepit cottage in the middle of the forest, not far 
                from the pit shaft where they worked. Shunned by the world for 
                their freakish appearance, they had grouped together where they 
                dug coal from beneath the ground and sold it at the market alongside 
                the metal tools and garden vegetables they produced. The dwarves 
                were not a pretty bunch. Their heads were large, their bodies 
                small, and their limbs short and stubby. They were related to 
                each other, but not too closely, and the brighter ones still felt 
                bitterness towards a world that either treated them as objects 
                of fun and derision or feared them as servants of the devil. This 
                latter reputation protected them to some extent from those who 
                might otherwise steal from them, or sell them off to a circus 
                freak show, but it meant that other than each other they rarely 
                had any human contact at all.<p>
                It was Sneezy who saw Snow White. He earned his name from the 
                dust allergy which was in no way assisted by his labours in the 
                coal mine and made much of his life a constant misery. He was 
                recovering from another fit of sneezing, while his six comrades 
                marched ahead, when he caught a glimpse of Snow White's remarkably 
                pale skin through the trees, where she was illuminated by the 
                sun breaking through the canopy. He signalled to the others to 
                be quiet, knowing that it was he who was most likely to break 
                the silence, and the seven dwarves gathered around Snow White's 
                body.<p>
                She was moaning from pain, a darkening bruise on her cheek and 
                over her eye, cuts and bruises all over her body, both from the 
                rape and her naked chase through the dark forest, including a 
                nasty gash on one of her ankles. Her legs were spread open which 
                meant that for all the dwarves except the resourceful Doc, this 
                was the first time any of them had ever seen a woman's crotch. 
                Snow White looked up at the dwarves around her, shivering with 
                fear. She believed that she was about to be attacked by goblins 
                or trolls who, as legend had it, feasted on the flesh of virgins 
                snatched from the villages. She had never seen such a deformed 
                or ugly bunch of people.<p>
                There was Sneezy, whose nose was constantly red and from which 
                usually trailed a globule of snot. There was Sleepy who had once 
                contracted an illness which had left him permanently lethargic 
                and for whom all physical effort was twice as great as it would 
                for anyone else. And the dwarves were known for their hard work. 
                There was Doc, the de facto leader of the group who handled the 
                dwarves' financial affairs and had negotiated terms with merchants 
                in the larger towns for some of their goods. He was short sighted, 
                but had succeeded in manufacturing spectacles which partly corrected 
                his vision, but meant that he looked especially monstrous behind 
                the thick glass. There was Grumpy who was well-named, and was 
                also the ugliest of the seven dwarves: one eye lower than the 
                other and his mouth twisted up to one side. Then there was Happy 
                who was a bit of a practical joker, but retained his popularity 
                with a good wit and a willingness to accept as good as he gave. 
                Bashful had a large birthmark on most of his face, which he was 
                understandably reluctant to let people see. And finally there 
                was Dopey. In most communities, he would have been considered 
                a village idiot, if he hadn't died in childhood, but amongst the 
                dwarves, his drooping lower lip and blatant mental deficiency 
                were treated with a sympathy unusual in these harsh unforgiving 
                times.<p>
                &quot;Don't eat me! Spare me!&quot; gasped Snow White, too weak 
                to stand up and make a run for safety.<p>
                The dwarves laughed, not all of them kindly, at the girl's stupidity 
                and ignorance. Doc, however, could see an advantage to be gained 
                from the situation, even if he couldn't focus especially well 
                on the physical manifestation of it. Here was a source of boundless 
                rest and recreation for him and his comrades, and no doubt a willing 
                worker in the cottage. Domesticity and home-cooking did not come 
                easily to the dwarves, and Doc was all too aware of how filthy 
                and untidy the dwarves' cottage was. He slapped Dopey hard on 
                the ear, who was laughing along with the others without really 
                being sure what was the object of their humour. Perhaps a naked 
                woman in the woods was inherently amusing in itself.<p>
                &quot;Don't laugh at the pretty lady,&quot; he commanded. For 
                some of the dwarves, this mention of Snow White's prettiness was 
                the first time that it occurred to them that this find carried 
                some material value. &quot;You can see she's in distress. Let's 
                take her home with us and care for her.&quot; He leaned over to 
                smile at the girl. &quot;I don't know what you think we are, dear 
                lady, but we're not ogres or monsters. We are mere artisans who 
                live in the forest, making a living from our own toil and we don't 
                wish you or anyone else any harm.&quot;<p>
                Snow White was reassured by the dwarf's kindness, although he 
                looked so monstrous behind the thick lenses of his spectacles, 
                and she gushed forth in a torrent of tears of gratitude which 
                served both to clean her face and to make her look more wretched. 
                &quot;Thank you, kind sir. You're generosity and kindness is surely 
                more than I truly deserve. I have been wrongfully used, but I 
                am sure that you will not be so monstrous as to treat me so criminally.&quot; 
                <p>
                It was not easy getting Snow White back to the cottage, but the 
                dwarves had great ingenuity. They fashioned a stretcher from some 
                branches and a cloth and carried her back on that, but it was 
                not an easy journey back for the small men. For a start, although 
                they were all of small height and stature, they were not all the 
                same height. Some of the dwarves were just three feet tall, while 
                others were more than four feet in height, not a huge difference 
                in absolute terms but quite substantial relative to each other. 
                But after much grumbling and some great effort, she was back at 
                the cottage, and was laid down on two beds which were given to 
                her, at great expense to Dopey and Bashful, the two dwarves least 
                likely to complain. And there she lay for several days while a 
                great fever engulfed her and the dwarves bickered amongst themselves 
                as to why they should even bother with her.<p>
                Eventually, Snow White was lucid enough to see where she was: 
                and a filthy, dusty place it was too. Doc came to see her while 
                Snow White sat up in the bed, naked of course as the dwarves had 
                no clothes which were nearly big enough for her. He looked at 
                her perky, sharp nippled breasts with pleasure that he just about 
                managed to disguise. He stood by Snow White as she turned to him, 
                with a sad look in his face.<p>
                &quot;How are you feeling, my dear?&quot; he asked in a gruff 
                but slightly squeaky voice.<p>
                &quot;Much better,&quot; Snow White replied with some effort. 
                &quot;You saved my life. How can I ever repay you?&quot;<p>
                For a start you can clean up the cottage, thought Doc, but he 
                was too tactful to say anything. &quot;We'll see,&quot; he said 
                with a smile. &quot;We are hard working people, and we need as 
                much help as we can. If you are willing, would you help us keep 
                house and home?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Gladly,&quot; smiled Snow White who at that stage had no 
                idea what a formidable task lay in front of her. After all, housework 
                was something she had become more than a little familiar with 
                after the years spent skivvying in her stepmother's large rambling 
                house. However, as her full wits returned to her, she saw just 
                what a mountain she had to climb. She was not only expected to 
                dust and clean the house, but to maintain the fire, cut wood, 
                prepare them dinner and sew their clothes. This was more work 
                than she'd ever done before, and at the end of each day the cottage 
                became only gradually more presentable than the decrepit hole 
                it was when she first arrived.<p>
                Moreover, all this work she had to do, however wet, cool or windy 
                it was, had to be done naked. The dwarves were not prepared to 
                make her any clothes and Snow White was in no sense of the word 
                encouraged to do something which, in any case, she only had the 
                most rudimentary idea of how to do. And she soon became aware 
                that the dwarves much preferred her to be naked, a thrill which 
                she was only beginning to understand. They argued that they had 
                more than enough work to do in making a bed which was big enough 
                for her to sleep in, so that Bashful and Dopey could sleep on 
                something more comfortably than smelly damp sheepskins in front 
                of the dying embers of the fire. <p>
                As she worked, most of the day by herself whilst the dwarves laboured 
                down the pit, she took pleasure from singing to herself while 
                birds hovered around in the garden and mice scurried across the 
                floor. She knew very few songs, but those she did afforded her 
                immense pleasure. One song she particularly liked was 'Sometime 
                My Prince Will Come', a traditional tune addressing the longings 
                of many lonely women in a country ravaged by war where men were 
                frequently in short supply. She would sometimes pause with the 
                brush in her hand and think of some dashing prince who would one 
                day come by, recognise her beauty and take her away to another 
                place. She would look at her skinny frame, the dark hairs of her 
                crotch against her snowy white skin, her thin legs and perky breasts 
                and imagine herself in the hands of someone like the young men 
                she occasionally saw when she was at her stepmother's house.<p>
                However, no prince came by to sweep her off her feet or to enjoy 
                her body close to his. Instead, Snow White came to know what else 
                her gratitude to the dwarves entailed. Doc was a subtle man, but 
                he knew how to achieve his end. He reminded Snow White that she 
                was no virgin and appraised her of the need to boost the morale 
                of his comrades. And then he taught her what was expected of her, 
                revealing a penis which despite Doc's size was, erect, much the 
                same dimensions as the forester's, the only other penis she had 
                ever seen. <p>
                &quot;Relax! It's only natural. And it is every girl's duty, as 
                surely as it is to keep the cottage clean and to prepare us our 
                dinners.&quot;<p>
                And Snow White had no reason to disbelieve him, as she took his 
                strange smelling organ into her mouth and jerked it up and down 
                as Doc advised her. And then, when it was as erect as it could 
                be, the dwarf gasping and grunting with excitement, she allowed 
                it to be taken into her vagina, a place until now only associated 
                with the release of urination, the pain of monthly periods and 
                the shame of her rape. Although Doc was the most practised of 
                the dwarves at lovemaking, he was not an expert. He knelt between 
                her much longer legs, supporting himself on her upper thighs, 
                as he thrust back and forth, a sensation Snow White tolerated 
                but was not enjoying in the slightest. The pain was quite acute 
                as it pushed into flesh that hadn't fully recovered from its recent 
                violation.<p>
                And Doc, of course, was not the only dwarf to penetrate her, although 
                he was probably her most frequent lover. All the dwarves took 
                turns with her, and, frequently, more than one would be enjoying 
                her naked body, happily fed on the food she'd prepared, wearing 
                the jerkins she had repaired, pushing into her vagina with penises 
                of seven different sizes and personalities. Although Doc was slightly 
                rough and crude, often taking his pleasure in Snow White's anus 
                as well as her vagina, an entry initially tight and painful, he 
                was probably the least bad of the dwarves. Although ill-informed 
                and often crude, he had more idea than all the other dwarves put 
                together as to how to put a girl at ease and how to treat her. 
                The jerks of his pelvis at her vagina may have been mechanical 
                and predictable, but at least he didn't slap her or slobber over 
                her. After a while, Snow White was able to tell that it was him 
                who was fucking her, even though she might have been distracted 
                by another penis in her mouth or even another one pushing into 
                her arse at the same time: quite a feat for such small people!<p>
                Sneezy was always rather brief and spasmodic: rather quickly loosing 
                his weight of semen into her vagina while he was engulfed in a 
                storm of sneezes. But Snow White preferred him fucking her, than 
                running his tongue over her body, inevitably leaving a trail of 
                snot and mucus wherever he had been. Just one of the many traces 
                of sex and slobbery that Snow White would soon have to sponge 
                off with icy cold water in the wooden basin. Sleepy was unenergetic, 
                but sometimes succumbed to exhaustion in the middle of his exertions, 
                his small frame collapsing onto her breasts, a thin trail of drool 
                coming from his mouth. Happy lived up to his name: his penis was 
                the largest of the dwarves, an attribute which made him inordinately 
                happy. It was painful enough when he fucked her vagina, but when 
                he forced it down her throat or up her arse, this was often pain 
                she could barely endure.<p>
                These were the dwarves she minded least. Of the others, she wasn't 
                sure whose lovemaking she disliked the most. Was it Bashful with 
                his hideous birthmark that he insisted she lick with her tongue? 
                Was it Grumpy, who was bad-tempered and impatient with her, frequently 
                slapping her as he grunted away with his small penis trying to 
                gain presence inside her orifices, his favourite of which being 
                inevitably her anus? Or was it Dopey, from whose lip always dribbled 
                a long drool of saliva, who fucked like an animal: viciously, 
                unremittingly and eventually with an unpleasant release of semen 
                which sometimes got her on the face, and in her eyes, and only 
                rarely anywhere between her legs.<p>
                And she never knew when the dwarves would be finished. With so 
                many of them, however exhausted she might be after hours of fucking 
                there was always at least one who still had reservoirs of energy 
                and semen to work out on her. The nights would go on for too long, 
                her sleep caught in snatches between spasms of lovemaking, sometimes 
                when blissful repose had finally come on her, and then another 
                prick in her face or her arse. Her orifices were constantly sore 
                and bruised and there was always a nasty bitter and sour taste 
                in her mouth. <p>
                Her relief when the dwarves left to work in the early morning 
                sunlight was compromised by the thought of the exhausting tasks 
                she had in front of her. Washing up the dishes from the night 
                before, preparing meals, chopping wood, gathering vegetables and 
                mushrooms from the dwarves' garden plot, skinning rabbits and 
                pheasants and occasionally boar, and, if there was time, dusting, 
                cleaning and scrubbing the cottage. Often she was on her hands 
                and knees, with a damp cold cloth and sweat pouring off her brow, 
                her only comfort being her singing. <p>
                And worse was to come. She'd noticed that she was no longer having 
                monthly periods, but in her na&iuml;vet&eacute; she assumed that 
                with so much sperm inside her it had simply blocked up her system, 
                although she was still able to shit and piss, which she always 
                did outside naked in the rain and snow where her ordure could 
                be used as fertiliser for the plot, the laying of which she never 
                relished. But then there was the swelling in her stomach which 
                she knew for sure meant that she was pregnant. It was Doc who 
                had to inform her how this had happened. Snow White was terribly 
                innocent of the causes of pregnancy assuming that a girl needed 
                the happy grace of marriage for this blessing of God's creation 
                to be bestowed on her. When she learnt about the link between 
                her nightly indignities and her changed condition this made her 
                somewhat bitter about it, frightened that she would soon be the 
                mother of another freak like one of the seven possible fathers.<p>
                Her state of pregnancy did not lead to a lessening of the dwarves' 
                predation on her body. They didn't mind the swell of her stomach 
                or the growing heaviness of her breasts. Indeed they frequently 
                put their mouths to her large sore nipples in the hope that they 
                would have a drink of the milk that would surely soon be emanating 
                from them. And it only made her labours in the cottage harder 
                to bear. The weight of logs and the heat of the kitchen fire became 
                more painful burdens than ever for her to endure.<p>
                As more months were added to her pregnancy, Snow White became 
                ever more desperate for a reprieve from her life of sex and servitude. 
                She was miserable when she looked after the house, the added weight 
                of her unborn child making her labours increasingly onerous. She 
                was miserable when the dwarves came home, their rapacious sexual 
                appetite not lessening while her own was diminishing yet further 
                with the burden and discomfort of her gravidity. But every day 
                as she pushed her broom, she would look out at the Spring sky, 
                the birds frolicking in the warm rays of the sun, and sing to 
                herself longingly that one day her prince would come.<p>
                However, the only visitor Snow White ever had since her first 
                days at the cottage was a woman in her late forties wrapped in 
                a black shawl, carrying a wicker basket in which there were several 
                apples and pears. The dwarves were at the pit, and Snow White, 
                naked as always, was pushing her broom across the uneven rocky 
                floor. The woman put her head through the window, the shutters 
                having been parted, and yelled across to Snow White &quot;Would 
                you like to buy some of my fruit, dear?&quot;<p>
                Snow White looked up from the floor where her broom had been sweeping 
                and smiled. The woman's voice was such a welcome sound after all 
                these months. A trilling soprano sound, in such contrast to the 
                gruff alto tenors of the seven dwarves. &quot;I'd love to,&quot; 
                she said, &quot;but I have no money.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Nor any clothes, I see,&quot; sniffed the middle-aged woman. 
                &quot;And this the first cottage I've come across in this accursed 
                wood for many a mile. Would you be so kind as to let me rest my 
                weary limbs before I go on my way?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Of course, I will,&quot; eagerly cried Snow White, unlatching 
                the door and letting the woman in. She shuffled in, pushing back 
                her hood to reveal a handsome chin and face, with long greying 
                hair, a proud arch to her slightly ragged neck and the smallest 
                trace of a wart below the curve of her lower lip. After seeing 
                only small ugly men for so many months, just the presence of another 
                woman was striking enough, but overwhelming everything else were 
                the woman's piercing dark eyes which ever so slightly reminded 
                Snow White of her stepmother. The woman sat down on a wooden stool, 
                and placed her basket on her knees.<p>
                &quot;My! You're a pretty girl!&quot; she said approvingly.<p>
                &quot;Thank you,&quot; smiled Snow White who got fewer such praises 
                from the dwarves in recent months.<p>
                The woman studied the cottage, the small beds and small scale 
                furniture and asked Snow White about her living arrangements, 
                smiling sympathetically as Snow White spoke, nodding her head 
                in encouragement and letting the tenor of her questions become 
                increasingly personal. She was particularly interested in Snow 
                White's account of why she was not allowed to wear clothes and 
                of the dwarves nightly predations on her body.<p>
                &quot;Such a beautiful girl!&quot; she sighed sympathetically. 
                &quot;Aren't men cruel?&quot;<p>
                &quot;But they saved my life in the woods,&quot; protested Snow 
                White. &quot;Were it not for them, I might have been eaten by 
                a wolf or a bear.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Indeed you might,&quot; smiled the woman. &quot;And the 
                little men abandon you all day in the cottage. When do they return?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Not 'til after dusk.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Is that so?&quot; the woman said. &quot;That is so many 
                hours away. And it is such a warm day. I'm stifled by my shawl.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Why not take it off,&quot; suggested Snow White helpfully.<p>
                &quot;Indeed I shall,&quot; smiled the woman, parting her shawl 
                at the front and letting it drop to the ground. As it did so, 
                it revealed a fine handsome naked body underneath, with skin as 
                ivory white as Snow White's own. Her breasts were heavy, but with 
                maturity rather than micturation. Her stomach bulged slightly 
                around her navel and her arms and legs were muscled and taut. 
                <p>
                She stood up and grinned at the startled Snow White. &quot;It 
                isn't right that you should know only the attentions of despicable 
                little men, who daily rape and besmirch you. What you need are 
                the attentions of a woman.&quot;<p>
                &quot;But that can't be right!&quot; gasped the innocent Snow 
                White, who in her life had never thought of such a thing. <p>
                &quot;It is the most right thing in the world,&quot; the woman 
                assured Snow White, striding over to the gravid girl, placing 
                her hands around her shoulders and pushing her face close to Snow 
                White's. &quot;And for the pleasure it would give me to show that 
                this is so, I shall gladly give you all my fruit.&quot;<p>
                Snow White looked at the apples and pears with greedy eyes. Although 
                it was many months since they must have fallen off the Autumn 
                trees, they looked succulent and firm. Her increased hunger, growing 
                in direct proportion to her waist line, got the better of her 
                reservations.<p>
                &quot;I would gladly find out if what you say is true,&quot; she 
                said with a timid smile.<p>
                The woman smiled again and pressed her lips and tongue against 
                Snow White's mouth. And so Snow White did find that there was 
                such a thing as a love which was more tender and to her more satisfying 
                than any she'd had before. The feel of the woman's bare flesh 
                against her own, the fingers that stroked and squeezed her vagina, 
                the tender kisses and caresses on her face, her neck, her stomach 
                and her lactating breasts. The two women fell onto the coarse 
                semen-stained linen sheets of Snow White's bed, hands and arms 
                and legs and feet intertwined, as their bodies sweated and struggled 
                against each other, Snow White enjoying the sweet taste of her 
                new lover's mouth, so much better than the foul odours that came 
                from the dwarves, especially after they had been drinking or smoking. 
                There was none of the painful penetration she so rarely enjoyed 
                from the dwarves. Her anus was licked, and not poked. The two 
                women's hair tangled together in sweaty dampness and intimate 
                contact.<p>
                And then the two lay down on the mattress, while Snow White glanced 
                guiltily at the abandoned broom, the unmade fire and the empty 
                coal scupper. The woman gently ran her fingers over Snow White's 
                sweaty body, following the taut curves of her stomach and the 
                protrusion of her navel. She tenderly kissed Snow White on the 
                forehead and above each eye.<p>
                &quot;So this has been your first time with another woman,&quot; 
                she commented. &quot;Let's hope it isn't your last.&quot;<p>
                Eventually, and with great sadness and tenderness, the woman put 
                her shawl back on, and departed, leaving Snow White as promised 
                with all her fruit. Snow White sat on her bed, lost in emotion 
                and confusion, idly eating the fruit, wondering whether in a perverse 
                way the woman had been the prince that she'd so often wished would 
                come along.<p>
                Unfortunately, the fruit was very much off-season, and only crude 
                preservatives had kept them looking so fresh and wholesome. They 
                also turned out to be quite poisonous, but Snow White was so lost 
                in her thoughts and so ravenous in her hunger, that she didn't 
                heed the warning signs from the foulness of their taste. It was 
                not much later that she wished she had.<p>
                When the dwarves returned, after wading through the vicious storm 
                which had broken out in the forest, they were tired and weary 
                from their day's work and looking forward to their evening meal. 
                They found no food waiting for them and instead discovered Snow 
                White doubled up on her bed, shrieking in agony as the poison 
                in the fruit took hold. In front of her was clear, foul-smelling 
                vomit, but this was as nothing in toxicity and disgustingness 
                as the stream of blood-flecked diarrhoea which was periodically 
                convulsing out of her arse and mingling with the semen stains 
                and sweat on her sheets. <p>
                The dwarves had absolutely no idea what to do, and it is likely 
                that their unprofessional attempts at medicine and first aid merely 
                added to the pain and distress that accompanied Snow White's last 
                few days. She was soon buried outside the dwarves' cottage, taking 
                her unborn child with her, soon to be only a distant and sentimental 
                memory to the dwarves, whose cottage was even sooner restored 
                to the untidiness and squalor it had been before they had met 
                Snow White.
              <p> When finally a prince did come by, it was too late for Snow 
                White, but it was probably just as well. It was only as a result 
                of the various wars that wracked the lands that any prince would 
                ever venture this far into the woods and then only for rapine 
                and pillage. Which is what he and his soldiers did, burning the 
                cottage, murdering the dwarves, ransacking their smallholding 
                and stealing all that they could find of any value. When the prince 
                left, the charred corpses of the seven dwarves behind him, all 
                that was left standing was the crude cross which marked where 
                Snow White lay.<b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">
