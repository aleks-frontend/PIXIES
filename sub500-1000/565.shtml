          Chapter 1 </p>
        <p>Chloe awoke. There was someone in bed with her. She blinked her eyes 
          against the piercing sunlight that was flooding the room. The realization 
          struck her that something hard was pressing between the cheeks of her 
          bare bottom. It continued to probe. Chloe gasped-no mistaking what it 
          was-and it was causing exquisite sensations. <br>
        </p>
        <p>She scanned the room for clues to his identity, and took in her discarded 
          clothes along with an unfamiliar denim jacket. Her head pounded with 
          the after effects of too much drink. In her dreamy, hungover state she 
          felt the stirrings of arousal. Something was holding her back from doing 
          the sensible thing, to turn round and discover his identity. Behind 
          her she heard the steady breathing of a man who was still asleep. That 
          would buy her some time until she decided what to do. <br>
        </p>
        <p>While waiting for the stranger to awaken she pieced together yesterday's 
          memories. Since finishing law school two months ago she had been touring 
          around Australia. She had taken the ten-hour bus journey yesterday, 
          from Sydney to Byron Bay, the notorious hippy resort on the east coast. 
          Yes, she remembered now, getting off the bus in the evening. Sweaty 
          and tired she had made her way to the nearest bar. And then? Images 
          floated into focus, it was coming back to her, gradually now. Her eyes 
          felt dry and she was in dire need of a coffee. She had met a man, an 
          English man, they had had several drinks. He had been amusing, with 
          a dry sense of humor. And then? Had they made love? Chloe had not the 
          faintest recollection of that occurring. With a sense of dread she hoped 
          that they had not. It was not something she was in the habit of doing, 
          sleeping with strange men the first night she met them. <br>
        </p>
        <p>His cock was still pressing into her, lower now, just skimming over 
          her labia. She bit her lip as a little tremor ran through her. It was 
          this pleasant pressure, she realized, that was making her reluctant 
          to turn to face him. An image was forming in her mind, of the man she 
          had spent the evening with, handsome, with dark hair. A snatch of conversation 
          floated into her mind. <br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;They're after me, I know it,&quot; he'd said. &quot;They've followed 
          me from London. I chose this place because it's completely off the beaten 
          track, just surfers and new agers, and still they find me.&quot; She 
          must have looked puzzled because he had continued, &quot;I saw the two 
          of them, waiting for me outside my hotel in a car. Now, everywhere I 
          look I see them. They're tailing me. Guess it's time to move on.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>She tried to make sense of it all as she stared at the blank, functional 
          walls of the room. She could hear the splash of the swimming pool beyond 
          the window. She barely remembered booking herself into this place, which 
          from the look of it was a youth hostel. <br>
        </p>
        <p>Behind her he started to murmur, beginning the slow journey from sleep 
          to consciousness. Reluctantly, she turned towards him. He was lying 
          with his head along one luxuriously outstretched arm. Her eyes took 
          in the curve of his biceps, then ran down to his bronzed chest, firmly 
          muscled, broad and hairless and very provocative. It was an enormous 
          relief to find that he was so good looking. <br>
        </p>
        <p>Her anxiety now dissolved, she desperately wanted to touch him. When 
          he opened his eyes she was lying only centimeters away. They were a 
          clear, piercing blue, fringed with black lashes. Blinking, he focused 
          on her. He rubbed his square chin, covered in stubble, and smiled. <br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Who on earth are you?&quot; He spoke in an immaculate English 
          accent.<br>
        </p>
        <p>She pulled the sheet up, the fact that she was completely naked with 
          a strange man, suddenly making her blush. <br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;I'm Chloe.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>He propped himself up on one arm. &quot;Oh, right. I'm Jaspar.&quot; 
          He fixed her with a direct stare, which made her feel as if she had 
          something to feel guilty about. &quot;And could you tell me how we happen 
          to be sharing this bed?&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;No. I was hoping you could tell me.&quot; She paused, lowering 
          her eyelids, then meeting his gaze again. &quot;Did we?&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Did we what?&quot; There was a trace of humor in his voice.<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Well, you know, have-&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Spit it out!&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Sex!&quot; she blurted.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Falling back onto the pillow, his chest shuddered with laughter.<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Well, that is nice! I took you to heaven and back, ooh, two or 
          three times. And you tell me you can't remember any of it?&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Well, I do remember meeting you, and getting horrendously pissed.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Oh, you do exaggerate, Chloe. A few beers, a couple of whiskies. 
          You were perfectly lucid.&quot; <br>
        </p>
        <p>While they were talking he had edged himself forward on the bed, so 
          that again she could feel his erect cock brushing against her pubic 
          hair. His body emanated heat, a heat that was causing thoughts to swirl 
          and collide in her head. She was confused and unsure what to believe 
          about him. He was dangerous, she sensed that, but he was also a puzzle 
          that Chloe was determined to get to the bottom of. If only she could 
          recall the night's events more fully. <br>
        </p>
        <p>She swept her long blonde hair away from her forehead, which was damp 
          with perspiration, the movement causing the sheet to fall away revealing 
          her full breasts, tanned to a golden brown and scattered with freckles 
          in the hollow between them. She reached down to pull up the sheet but 
          he gently pushed it away again.<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;I just can't remember. What did we do exactly?&quot; she murmured. 
          <br>
        </p>
        <p>His gaze had moved from her large gray-green eyes, skimming over her 
          delicate nose, her mouth with its full lower lip and had finally come 
          to rest on her breasts, scrutinizing her nipples which tingled and hardened 
          under his gaze.<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;When I see those the memories come flooding back to me.&quot; 
          He paused as if chewing over a thought. &quot;Look, why waste time with 
          me giving you a detailed account of what happened last night.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Well, what do you suggest?&quot; she asked coquettishly.<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Well, how about I show you?&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>She started to laugh. It was a very tempting offer. &quot;I just don't 
          know if it would be-&quot;<br>
          &quot;What? Appropriate? You're an English girl a million miles away 
          from home. Who's going to know what you get up to?&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>She relaxed. He was right of course. This was her last taste of freedom 
          before settling down to her career. And since they had done it last 
          night, it seemed churlish to object now. Anyway, she had always found 
          that sex in the morning cured a hangover. <br>
        </p>
        <p>All her objections melted away as she felt her nipple slip into his 
          mouth. His stubble rubbed against the areole, its abrasiveness strangely 
          arousing as he sucked hard on her erect nipple. With his hand he rolled 
          the other nipple between his fingers, sending sharp arrows of pleasure 
          across her breasts. Then he took it in his mouth, moving his tongue 
          back and forth across its sensitive tip, causing Chloe to moan with 
          the almost unbearable pleasure. Then he started attacking her breasts 
          with small bites, as Chloe arched her back, surprised but enjoying his 
          forceful handling of the situation. <br>
        </p>
        <p>She hadn't experienced such driven male energy in a long time. He was 
          stoked up, and his fiery passion bubbled under the surface, desperate 
          for release. Her pussy grew hot as the juices began to flow. His mouth 
          moved down her body, slowly, tantalizingly biting the taut flesh of 
          her stomach and moving down, inch by inch to the wispy blonde hair that 
          covered her mound. <br>
        </p>
        <p>Instinctively her thighs opened, ready for him. He paused for a moment 
          and she felt a flutter of self-consciousness as she thought of him scrutinizing 
          her pussy. He pulled back her labia and began to lick back and forth 
          along the opening, drinking in her musky juices. Every time his tongue 
          reached the top of her slit it brushed casually across her clit, creating 
          rampant pulses of pleasure. <br>
        </p>
        <p>Finally, his tongue settled on the swollen bud, dragging it gently 
          from side to side. She gasped in delight as he abruptly entered her 
          with his two fingers, driving her back on the bed as she squirmed against 
          his hand. As he thrust his fingers deep within her tight tunnel while 
          continuing to torment her clit she began to buck against his mouth, 
          so urgent was her need for release from this build up of exquisite pleasure. 
          She reached her climax gradually, one peak of pleasure more heightened 
          than the last until finally she felt herself flung into darkness, spasming 
          wildly while cross-currents of pleasure coursed from deep within her 
          with an intensity that she had never experienced before. <br>
        </p>
        <p>As she lay panting, he kissed her hard, his tongue probing for hers, 
          tasting herself on his tongue. His stubble was rubbing against the sensitized 
          skin around her mouth, stoking up the heat between them a further notch. 
          Pulling away from him she slid down his hard body to his cock that had 
          so delightfully awoken her that morning. As he lay on his back she gazed 
          down at it, then reached to touch it. It was impressive in length and 
          girth. At that moment she felt an urgent stirring within her pussy. 
          After the impressive way he had made her climax with his hand she felt 
          sure he would be equally talented when he fucked her. <br>
        </p>
        <p>She took the head in her mouth while sheathing his foreskin back and 
          forth. Circling the shaft tightly with her hand to prevent the whole 
          of its impressive length from entering, she took more of it into her 
          mouth, moving deliciously along its length and tasting the stirrings 
          of his arousal, which was leaking from the tip. <br>
        </p>
        <p>She was lost in her sensual activity when he pushed her gently away 
          so that she was now on her back, her hair wildly tangled around her 
          flushed face. He eased himself on top of her, and, holding her thighs 
          wide open, began to push his cock into her entrance. He moved back and 
          forth, at first with very shallow thrusts of his cock until she again 
          began to moan and grab at his shoulders, wanting him deeper inside her. 
          He stopped for a moment, bent down to her ear and whispered,<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Shall I let you into a little secret? We didn't do anything last 
          night. I remember everything perfectly. I wanted to, but you just passed 
          out on the bed. So I had to store up all my energy until now, our first 
          time. But it was certainly worth it!&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>He started to butt his cock into her vagina, a little deeper this time. 
          <br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Oh, you bastard,&quot; she said, in mock anger. She no longer 
          cared how she had got here, only that she was here on the verge of him 
          taking her. She moved her legs so that they hooked over his shoulders. 
          With a jolt he entered her fully, with such force that her breasts quivered. 
          She cried out at the ferocity of his entrance. It felt good to be filled 
          up so completely. With every thrust he drove into her lubricated tunnel, 
          the head of his cock hitting the neck of her womb. She looked up at 
          him. His eyes were closed, perspiration forming on his forehead, as 
          he ploughed into her. Ripples of pleasure coursed through her as she 
          spasmed around his bone-hard cock. The waves of her climax continued 
          to run through her as he jerked inside her, still pounding her, letting 
          out a loud cry as she felt him ejaculate deep within her.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Afterwards she felt a warm glow settle on her body as she lay face 
          down on the bed. The sun was still streaming through the window. She 
          should get up, but not just yet. She could sense that he was becoming 
          restless beside her. He started to slip on some shorts and a T-shirt. 
          Was he trying to run out on her already? she thought apprehensively.<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Where are you going?&quot; <br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Don't worry. I'm just off to try and find the toilet.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>When he had left she lazily rolled over onto her back. She needed to 
          know something about him. If there really were some people following 
          him, might she also be in danger? Suddenly a pale shape registered at 
          the edge of her vision. Rolling onto one side she propped herself up 
          on her elbow to get a better look at what had caught her eye. She could 
          just make out the tip of an envelope protruding from his jacket pocket. 
          She guessed that she had been too hungover to notice it earlier. She 
          was not in the habit of reading other people's letters, but its lure 
          was too powerful to resist. <br>
        </p>
        <p>She got out of bed and pulled it out, rationalizing that it was her 
          only means of getting some answers. <br>
        </p>
        <p>The back of the envelope had deeply embossed letters spelling out Clancy 
          and Durham, a name far from unfamiliar to her. Clancy and Durham were 
          in a league of their own, one of the most reputable law firms in London. 
          A firm that was completely out of her reach, she thought with some bitterness. 
          She had worked hard at university, harder than many of her colleagues. 
          She had applied to many firms but had pinned her hopes on getting a 
          contract at one of the big ones in the City. So far she had been unsuccessful. 
          Knowing that the competition for these places was very fierce was no 
          compensation. <br>
        </p>
        <p>She held the envelope in her hand, wondering whether she had the courage 
          to draw out its contents.<br>
        </p>
        <p>She heard his footsteps return, and as he turned the handle she quickly 
          stuffed the envelope back into his pocket and just made it back into 
          the bed as he entered the room.<br>
        </p>
        <p>He lay down beside her and started nuzzling her neck, but her mind 
          was still on the letter.<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Are you hungry?&quot; she asked.<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Yes, a bit.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Would you get me something? I'm famished.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;I'm not surprised. That was really something this morning.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;I'm glad you enjoyed yourself. I certainly did. But right now 
          I really need a coffee and a bacon sandwich.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Certainly. What madam wants madam shall have.&quot; He leant 
          over and kissed her full on the lips, then left the room.<br>
        </p>
        <p>To her relief, he left his jacket. She hesitated for a moment, then 
          swiftly pulled out the envelope. Surely it would offer some clue to 
          Jaspar's identity. Unfolding the thick creamy paper, she read,<br>
        </p>
        <p>Dear Jaspar,<br>
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for your postcard. Byron Bay sounds like an interesting place 
          but I fear that the drugs that you are smoking have addled your brain. 
          Unfortunately, I must decline your request to lend you ten thousand 
          pounds. I can't imagine what you need it for. Surely you haven't spent 
          your inheritance already? If you have squandered your father's money 
          within six months you have only yourself to blame. May I suggest that 
          you get yourself a job? I hope that the prospect of working will not 
          prove to be too much of a shock to the system. <br>
        </p>
        <p>John<br>
        </p>
        <p>That Jaspar had money worries came as no surprise to Chloe, but what 
          really interested her about the letter was the fact that Jaspar's uncle 
          worked at this firm. To her great shame, she had not yet managed to 
          secure a position, although a small firm in Oxford had asked her to 
          contact them when she returned. She would have to start the long climb 
          to the top from there. <br>
        </p>
        <p>Folding the letter, she carefully slid it back into the envelope, placed 
          it in the jacket and waited for Jaspar to return.<br>
        </p>
        <p>That evening, after spending the day together, they lay on the beach, 
          looking up at the stars. She could sense that Jaspar's mind was full 
          of his own problems but she didn't want to pry. She wanted to keep things 
          casual. Soon they would go their separate ways, and she sensed that 
          getting involved with Jaspar could only spell trouble.<br>
        </p>
        <p>She was lying across his chest as he lay sprawled out on the white 
          sand, running his fingers through her hair. <br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;I'll have to be going tomorrow.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Where to?&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;I can't really say.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;What's the big secret?&quot; He continued to run his fingers 
          along her scalp, but then abruptly he yanked a lock of her hair.<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Ow!&quot; He continued to tug at her hair so she shook him free, 
          and sat up. &quot;What the hell was that for?&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;For being nosey.&quot; <br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Are you crazy?&quot; She rubbed her head. Suddenly she was glad 
          that he was leaving. He was definitely a little unhinged. &quot;I only 
          asked.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;I'll ask the questions if you don't mind.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>There was an awkward silence. <br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;What do you do back in England?&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;I've just finished law school. When I get back I need to find 
          a job as a trainee solicitor.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Nothing lined up?&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Nothing worth talking about,&quot; she said sulkily.<br>
        </p>
        <p>He became silent. Chloe turned and looked down at him quizzically.<br>

        <p>&quot;What is it?&quot;<br>
          &quot;Nothing. I was just thinking.&quot; He took another moment to 
          process a thought. &quot;I know someone who works at Clancy and Durham, 
          my uncle.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Really!&quot; she said with commendable deceit. &quot;They're 
          in a league of their own.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Yeah? He's the big boss man. Heads the Corporate Litigation Department. 
          How about I put in a good word for you?&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Oh, I don't know if I'd fit in at a place like that,&quot; she 
          said, turning away. Now that the possibility of getting a job there 
          had suddenly presented itself she started to feel anxious. Would she 
          fit in?<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Don't sell yourself short.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Well, I don't know, they've probably filled all the trainee solicitors 
          positions by now, but I'd be happy to start as a paralegal.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Well, I'll see what I can do. My sister Felicity works there 
          as a paralegal. She's been there for a year now. But like you, she's 
          desperate to become a solicitor.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;If you're sure you don't mind. That would be great.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;No problem. I'll phone him as soon as it's nine am in London.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>She buried her head in his neck, murmuring, &quot;Thank you Jaspar, 
          thank you.&quot; <br>
        </p>
        <p>A wave of optimism flooded through her. Suddenly all her doubts left 
          her. She would make it as a solicitor, that she was sure of.<br>
