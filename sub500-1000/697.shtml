        <p>The morning went quickly for Paul. He had changed jobs again, though 
          working in an office had not been his desired job. But financial priorities 
          had ended dictating the direction of his career. But now he had the 
          afternoon to himself. It was pleasantly warm for an autumnal day so 
          he decided to take a visit to the local churchyard before going home. 
          It was only a ten minute walk, but well worth it for the peace and quiet 
          that it offered amidst the busy working life of Canterbury.<p>
          Leaving his workplace he quickly made his way through the alleys and 
          quiet back streets, until he finally reached the churchyard. Few ventured 
          into the churchyard during day time, so he was pretty much guaranteed 
          peace and quiet. Taking up position on the bench that overlooked the 
          fields beyond he sat back and began to breath deeply. Focusing his concentration 
          upon a bright light above him he imagined that it gradually descended 
          down through his aura and into his body, soaking away all mental and 
          physical aches and pains. After five or so minutes of meditation he 
          gradually brought himself back into conscious awareness of his surroundings. 
          Spiritually and mentally he felt partly revitalised, but his back still 
          ached from the time spent in an office chair looking at a computer screen. 
          <p>
          &quot;Oh for a better life.&quot; He said to himself, wishing that his 
          desire of authorship had taken off. At least then he wouldn't have to 
          work in a boring office. Everything would be better he thought to himself. 
          <p>
          &quot;No, it wouldn't.&quot; A new thought entered his consciousness, 
          one that seemed higher and more objective about his circumstances. These 
          dreams, will they never leave me? He wondered. <p>
          The creaking of the gate at the far corner of the churchyard brought 
          him back to his environment, another reminder that he wasn't quite as 
          developed as he often thought he was.<p>
          He watched as an attractive long haired brunette pushed open the gate, 
          passed through the opening and closed it behind her. She was of medium 
          height and had remarkably beautiful eyes. Her clothes seemed practical: 
          a pair of black boots, a long velvet skirt, a blouse, jumper and long 
          coat. <p>
          She didn't look over at him, but merely followed the path along the 
          far side of the church so that within a few moments she was out of view. 
          Breathing in deeply he calmed his mind and sat trying to remain aware 
          of himself and his surroundings. His thoughts focused on the attractive 
          lady, wondering where she'd come from and where she was going, she was 
          obviously interesting to be venturing alone into a churchyard. <p>
          His mind wandered again this time fantasising about the possibility 
          of a wild romantic encounter. Was she single? Probably not, she was 
          too attractive to be single. But she was alone. Maybe her partner was 
          a little way behind, or waiting for her inside the church? Without another 
          thought he got up off the bench and made his way to the front of the 
          church. He was alert hoping that she might still be around, but if she 
          was he didn't see her. &quot;She's gone.&quot; He quietly muttered to 
          himself as he reached the entrance to the church and pushed open the 
          old front door.<p>
          It was quiet, cold and dark inside the church. He stood quietly for 
          a few moments, before proceeding inwards, through the nave and up to 
          the high altar. The Christian iconography still intrigued him, the statue 
          of a crucified Christ indicating a mystery that lay deeper than the 
          accepted Christian teaching allowed. There was more to the religion 
          of Christ he was sure, but the modern clergy - of whatever denomination 
          - didn't seem to hold the keys, they were to be found elsewhere, in 
          hidden and secret teachings. <p>
          A desire to bring forth some energy came upon him - as it usually did 
          in such places. Pausing for a moment he used his breath to further calm 
          his mind before taking in a final deep breath and commencing a sacred 
          chant that he'd been taught years ago whilst a member of a secret society. 
          It was a short chant, but he merely repeated the phrase raising and 
          lowering the tone in a slow manner. It was a sad chant, invoking a pre-Christian 
          pagan goddess that had been hunted by an ancient British King. She had 
          escaped but since that day had been seen with an arrow through her breast. 
          Singing the chant was akin to calling her.<p>
          Quietly she crept into the church, intrigued by the mysterious cantor. 
          The song was unlike those you'd expect to hear in a Christian Church. 
          Their hymns were far less poetic and left little spiritual feeling within 
          the cantors. That was one of the contributing factors explaining why 
          most people didn't attend church any longer. She took a seat at the 
          rear of the church watching and listening in silence to the man who 
          stood facing the high altar singing his heart away. It was a beautiful 
          if slightly unearthly song. <p>
          Coming to the last phrase of seven, he closed his eyes and meditated 
          again. <p>
          Meditation was something he did often when he was trying to find some 
          inner peace. Nothing else seemed to provide it, it was to him one of 
          the few things that no one could ever take away. <p>
          Turning away from the altar he began to walk back along the nave to 
          the entrance. And there she was sitting at the rear on the left hand 
          side. He smiled and she smiled back. <p>
          &quot;That was very nice.&quot; She said. <p>
          &quot;I'm not in very good voice,&quot; he said still smiling.<p>
          &quot;What was it?&quot; <p>
          &quot;Chant to a goddess.&quot; He replied not wishing to tell her exactly 
          where he'd been taught it.<p>
          &quot;Where are you from?&quot; He asked, walking up to her. <p>
          &quot;I'm from the Midlands.&quot; She replied.<p>
          &quot;Ah, whereabouts? I used to live in Shropshire.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Really?&quot;<p>
          &quot;Yes, Church Stretton.&quot;<p>
          &quot;I live in Shrewsbury.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Ah yeah, I went there quite a lot, it's a very nice town.&quot; 
          &quot;Church Stretton's really nice as well. The Long Mynd is lovely.&quot; 
          She replied, warming to him &quot;Yeah, it is isn't it. Do you go there 
          very much?&quot;<p>
          &quot;Only occasionally, it's full of tourists most of the time.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Yeah, it was when I was living there.&quot;<p>
          They talked for a while, he asking about her visit to Canterbury, she 
          about the chant and his obvious interest in spiritual maters.<p>
          &quot;So you're single then?&quot; She asked him.<p>
          &quot;Yeah,&quot; he said, he seemed a little embarrassed by his circumstance.<p>
          &quot;Me too,&quot; she said, &quot;I'm always looking for Mr Right.&quot;<p>
          &quot;If he exists!&quot; He said, &quot;well, he or she I mean.&quot;<p>
          &quot;I don't suppose you could do me a favour?&quot; She asked, all 
          of a sudden changing the subject.<p>
          &quot;If it's in my power, of course.&quot; He replied obligingly. &quot;Well 
          I seem to have got myself in a pickle. I need to get to a friends house, 
          but I've lost my purse, I don't suppose, if it is no bother you might 
          be able to give me a lift or lend me some money. I promise I'll repay 
          you, but I really need to get to there before 2pm otherwise she's going 
          to be going out and I won't have anywhere to stay for the night.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Well, I could do either actually. What would you prefer? I mean, 
          if you're unsure of travelling with a stranger then I can lend you the 
          money. Where do you need to get to?&quot;<p>
          &quot;Do you know a village called Wye?&quot;<p>
          &quot;Yes I do actually, it's over by Godmersham, it's a very nice village. 
          Whereabouts does your friend live then?&quot;<p>
          &quot;Well she actually lives in a mansion house this side of it, it's 
          got two dragons on the gate posts.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Yeah I know the place. I've been past it when I take the back 
          road to Wye. Look, it's only one thirty why don't I give you a lift. 
          I can easily get you there by 2pm. There's no way you'd get there by 
          train in time and a taxi is unlikely.&quot; &quot;If it's no bother?&quot;<p>
          &quot;No, no problem at all, my cars only around the corner in the car 
          park. Would you like to go now?&quot;<p>
          Within five minutes they were in Paul's car and on their way to the 
          Wye Mansion. Luckily the main roads were relatively clear and as Paul 
          knew the back roads they were able to make relatively good time. But 
          despite this the distance was still too far for them to get there by 
          the time she wanted. They turned into the Mansion drive at five past 
          two. <p>
          &quot;I'm sorry you're late for your friend. What will you do now?&quot; 
          Paul asked once they'd reached the Mansion house.<p>
          &quot;Oh it doesn't matter, I have a key.&quot; She replied. <p>
          &quot;But I thought you said you couldn't get in?&quot;<p>
          &quot;Yes sorry about that.&quot; She said without any apparent sense 
          of guilt. &quot;Would you like to come in for a drink?&quot;<p>
          &quot;Yeah, that'd be nice.&quot; He said disturbed at being taken for 
          a fool. <p>
          &quot;Big house.&quot; Paul said taking a sip from his cup of tea <p>
          &quot;Yes, I used to visit here when I was young. My mum used to visit 
          here, Susie's mum and my mum were very close friends. <p>
          &quot;I still don't know your name?&quot; Paul said. <p>
          &quot;Lucy.&quot;<p>
          &quot;And I'm.&quot;<p>
          &quot;And you're Paul.&quot; Lucy said cutting him off, &quot;I know. 
          You are here for a special reason.&quot;<p>
          Her words drifted off, slowing down and gradually distorting, the room 
          blackened and he slumped back against the cushions on the settee. </p>
        <p>II<p>
          It was dark when he awoke and it took him some time to get accustomed 
          to his surroundings. The floor was comfortable but his movements were 
          restricted in some way. Paralysis he thought, his subconscious mind 
          immediately jumping to a worst-case scenario. Taking a deep breath he 
          attempted to sit up as best he could. He was naked and his arms and 
          legs were splayed outwards so that he was lying in an x position. The 
          room was empty, but he was lying on a thick and comfortable mattress. 
          He looked down at his penis and saw that some sort of leather strapping 
          had been attached to its base and around his scrotum. Although he was 
          limp now he wondered if this would restrict him were he to became erect. 
          What the hell had happened? He remembered giving a lift to the pretty 
          girl. What was her name? Lucy. Her friend had gone somewhere and they'd 
          sat and had a cup of tea. Had the tea been spiked?<p>
          For a moment he thought he could hear singing. Low almost inaudible, 
          it was a strange song, slow and almost melancholic. The sound gradually 
          subsided, replaced by footsteps and female laughter. He swallowed, his 
          heart rate increased and he felt the sensation of fear rise. What the 
          hell had happened? Who had done this to him and why? The footsteps got 
          louder someone was definitely approaching. A key was inserted into a 
          lock, turned and then, from somewhere behind him a door was opened. 
          <p>
          &quot;He's awake.&quot; A female voice said.<p>
          &quot;Good,&quot; Replied another voice that sounded familiar. Was it 
          Lucy? He wondered.<p>
          He strained to turn around but his bindings served to restrict his movement. 
          <p>
          &quot;I see you fitted him with a harness, good idea.&quot; The first 
          voice said. &quot;Yes, I thought it would give us a little more control 
          over him.&quot; It was definitely Lucy.<p>
          Painstakingly he heard them move slowly forwards. He was concerned about 
          his predicament but also incredibly turned on by his situation. He felt 
          his cock twitch and gradually come to life. The harness proved a little 
          more restricting than he wished, but it wasn't so restricting as to 
          prevent him becoming fully erect. &quot;Look, he's getting an erection.&quot; 
          The first woman said. &quot;A bit premature since he doesn't know what 
          he's in for.&quot;<p>
          The other one laughed, he felt self-conscious and embarrassed.<p>
          Two figures moved into view, one on either side of him. They both wore 
          featureless robes, one black the other white. The face on his left was 
          covered in a featureless white mask save for two sockets that served 
          as eyes and the eyes beyond the sockets were pure black matching the 
          blackness of her robe. The mask on the right in contradistinction was 
          of a shiny black appearance and the eyes beyond were pure white again 
          matching the white robe that she wore. <p>
          &quot;Who are you? What is going on? Is that you Lucy? What are you 
          doing?&quot;<p>
          &quot;Silence,&quot; the unfamiliar voice said. &quot;you have been 
          led here by your higher god. Relax, be at peace and you will find peace.&quot; 
          Her words soothed him and he relaxed a little.<p>
          &quot;Breath in,&quot; Lucy said, &quot;relax and we shall take you 
          to realms that previously you only dreamt of.&quot;<p>
          The woman to his right leant forward and with her right hand ran her 
          long fingernails across his chest. Likewise, Lucy, on his left did the 
          same. He hadn't noticed overly long fingernails when they first met, 
          so it was likely that they were false. Lucy's claws ran downwards from 
          his chest to his groin where they scrapped along the length of his penis.<p>
          The woman to his right produced two chains that she handed to Lucy who 
          in turn attached them to the harness that was secured around the base 
          of his shaft and his balls. His erection had remained since they'd first 
          noticed it. <p>
          &quot;We shall be taking you to see the Mistress. She will instruct 
          you on the path that you must take to achieve enlightenment.&quot; Lucy 
          said as she attached a new set of chains to his ankles whilst the other 
          woman unbound his bed chains. They repeated the same procedure for his 
          wrists, though ensuring to cuff them behind his back, before helping 
          him to sit up and with their unspoken assistance he was made to stand. 
          He felt a tug on the chains that were attached to his penis harness 
          and shuffled along behind them in a state of overpowered submission.<p>
          The procession headed for the doorway and the flooring changed from 
          cold floorboards to a thick warm carpet. He was led along a landing, 
          passing a window that revealed large gardens under the cover of darkness, 
          then up a flight of steps and onto another landing until finally he 
          was made to stop at a doorway. &quot;Wait here.&quot; He was told then 
          left alone. Time seemed to stand still. Now and again he thought he 
          could hear movement in the room closest to him, but no one came back 
          and he wondered whether he should try and get the hell out, or wait 
          and see what would happen next. Crazy thoughts passed through his mind, 
          but deep down he sensed that this was right. It felt like some sort 
          of initiation ceremony. Robed, masked and clawed Temple members, or 
          guardians perhaps, a naked and bound neophyte, the sound of chanting. 
          It all seemed to fit together. But he could be mistaken. <p>
          He shivered a little, getting cold from the lack of movement and his 
          nakedness. Then, suddenly he heard footsteps approaching from behind. 
          Moving in front of him the right hand lady spoke as they both took a 
          leash. &quot;Now, we will enter.&quot; They were both still masked and 
          robed. Looking down at his state of arousal Lucy's free hand reached 
          down, took him in her hand and began to massage him back to life then, 
          when he was suitably aroused she let go of his cock turned around and 
          knocked sharply on the door in front of her.<p>
          &quot;Who seeks entrance?&quot; A female voice enquired &quot;I come 
          bearing a gift of masculinity for the temple.&quot; &quot;How does he 
          come?&quot;<p>
          &quot;In submission before the might of the Servants of the Goddess.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Why does he come?&quot; <p>
          &quot;So that his sleep may be brought to an end.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Who brings him to me?&quot;<p>
          &quot;The Sisters of Watchers.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Then enter in humility and peace.&quot;<p>
          The conversation had informed him of a great many things, though he 
          still had many questions. How had they found him? Unless his inner work 
          had sent reverberations to the right people?<p>
          The door opened and he was led inwards. A beautiful feminine aroma greeted 
          him as he entered. The room was warm and packed full of Temple members. 
          There didn't seem to be any males present, which increased his fear, 
          embarrassment and state of arousal. He remembered when he had once had 
          to briefly walk through a large gathering of women and they had all 
          given him a look that purveyed sexual challenge, he had felt nervous 
          then, but that was nothing in comparison to this. <p>
          He was led into a large circle within a circle. In front of him his 
          two Guardians stood, white robed on the right and black robed on the 
          left. Three black marble steps led up to a throne behind which a large 
          septagon slowly revolved in a clockwise motion. As it rotated it made 
          a strange low humming noise, which he noticed was gradually causing 
          an effect upon his unconscious as he could already feel his astral body 
          coming into awareness. Seated upon the throne sat a very beautiful brunette, 
          she wore little or no make up and had an enormous sense of presence 
          about her. She was dressed in the style of a classical dominatrix; thigh 
          high boots, stockings attached to suspenders themselves attached to 
          the lower part of an open breasted PVC basque that ran up in between 
          her exposed breasts and formed a collar around her neck. She wore bright 
          red lipstick and her dark hair was combed back in a classical Spanish 
          style. On either side of her a naked hand maiden was positioned. Both 
          had been completely shaven from top to bottom making them appear remarkably 
          unusual, an appearance that was accentuated by the fact that both their 
          bodies were painted causing the illusion of contours where none would 
          naturally exist. The art had obviously been drawn in such a fashion 
          as to arouse the sexual desire of any heterosexual male that might set 
          eyes upon them.<p>
          &quot;You who have been brought here,&quot; it was the dominatrix upon 
          the throne that spoke, &quot;do not know our ways, yet you have been 
          seeking us for a long time. We are the Sisterhood of the Watchers. We 
          exist to awaken the sleeping, to lead men from the darkness of the shadows 
          to the illumination of the awakened state. What is it that you seek?&quot;<p>
          &quot;I seek freedom from suffering.&quot; He answered as honestly as 
          he could.<p>
          &quot;Do you seek to serve womanhood?&quot;<p>
          &quot;I seek to serve all beings.&quot; A sharp tug on his chains indicated 
          that he'd answered incorrectly.<p>
          &quot;Do you seek to serve womanhood?&quot;<p>
          &quot;I do,&quot; he said.<p>
          &quot;How will you serve?&quot;<p>
          &quot;In all the ways that I can.&quot; Another sharp tug.<p>
          &quot;How will you serve?&quot;<p>
          &quot;I will serve in mind, body and spirit.&quot; No tug.<p>
          &quot;Are you prepared to undergo the tests?&quot; <p>
          &quot;I am, but I am not aware of what these tests will be.&quot; He 
          felt the chains become taught, but it was obvious that the questioner 
          did not feel that he had been out of order.<p>
          &quot;The tests will be revealed to you one at a time. You have already 
          passed the first series, but now there are more for you and they will 
          get harder. We seek to develop strength in mind, body and spirit and 
          it is only by passing through a series of tests or ordeals that this 
          is possible.&quot; With that the questioner fell silent. <p>
          Another tug on his chains indicated that he was to be led away without 
          further comment. As he made his way out through a door on the opposite 
          side of the room the robed celebrants moved in and surrounded him, hands 
          reached out and touched his naked body, sharp nails raked along his 
          back, a hand briefly stroked his thigh, another reached for his manhood 
          and pulled his foreskin back exposing his glans. A tongue flicked into 
          right his ear whilst a strange exotic voice whispered erotic ideas into 
          his left. A pull on the two chains sharply led him away from the crowd 
          of sirens. A door was opened and he was led through into a small confined 
          windowless passageway. &quot;Wait here.&quot; He was told and left alone 
          once more as his two guardians passed through the door ahead of him.<p>
          &quot;What the hell is happening?&quot; He muttered to himself. Behind 
          him he heard a key turn in the door, locking him out of the Temple.<p>
          III<p>
          By the time the two guardians returned to lead him into the next room 
          he was again shaking from the cold.<p>
          &quot;Where are we going now?&quot; He asked, his voice shaking, an 
          indication of cold and nervous excitement.<p>
          &quot;You are to undergo a ritual bath after that you shall rest until 
          called for.&quot; The unknown guardian said. He tried to place the voice 
          and wondered if she was a local girl. Picking up his leads Lucy unlocked 
          the door ahead of him and then led him inwards. <p>
          An aroma of incense greeted him. The room was large with a massive circular 
          bath positioned in the centre of the room. The four walls were mirrored 
          and at each corner a woman was dressed in the habits and robes of a 
          nun, save that they were all white as opposed to the traditional black 
          of the Christian orders. Standing within the bath were three naked women 
          - all with different coloured hair: brunette, blonde, redhead. As he 
          looked about him, his attendant guardians uncuffed him and released 
          him from his penis harness. The hands on his genitals combined with 
          the site of the three naked women caused him to become erect once more. 
          He could feel his desire for some form of sexual release growing more 
          intense as time went on.<p>
          &quot;Come,&quot; the blonde, said her voice soft and sultry. In the 
          mirrors he watched his two guardians leave him, closing and locking 
          the door behind them as they went. He walked forward towards the blonde 
          who massaged her breasts with soapy suds. The nuns in the corner remained 
          motionless, their eyes staring madly, though they appeared to be focusing 
          not on their surroundings but on something within their own minds. It 
          was obvious that they were in some form of meditative trance and that 
          this led to a very heightened state of self-awareness. <p>
          He was familiar with esoteric teachings that portrayed this idea of 
          self-awareness, it was known under different names; awakening, self-awareness, 
          self-remembering, mindfulness, watching, self-consciousness. They all 
          meant the same, a heightened state of awareness of the part of the being 
          that watched all internal and external phenomena. And here he was standing 
          naked in a bathroom with four apparently awakened nuns. As he realised 
          the enlightened state of the nuns he felt a warmness suddenly rise within 
          himself. It started at his genitals and then proceeded to simultaneously 
          to descend down his legs, into his feet and rise up through his chest 
          and into his shoulders, then down his arms and into his hands and fingertips 
          whilst simultaneously ascending into his head. His astral body became 
          incredibly strong and present. Looking about him he could also see the 
          astral bodies of the three water nymphs, each one a beautiful and lovely 
          soft pink, indicating he thought the depths of their spiritual love. 
          It was almost as though time itself was coming to a halt. He reached 
          the edge of the bath and then began to descend the steps. The water 
          was warm and his feet and legs tingled as he gradually submerged himself. 
          When his genitals touched the water his loins and body shuddered as 
          though he were undergoing a mini psychic orgasm.<p>
          As he took the final steps into the centre of the bath the three water 
          nymphs moved toward him and encircled him. In unison their hands touched 
          his body and he let himself slide back into the water that proved to 
          be incredibly buoyant. &quot;Close your eyes and your journey to the 
          world you have been seeking all your life, shall truly commence.&quot; 
          Her voice was soft and he looked into her green eyes and felt nothing 
          but love, empathy and compassion for him. &quot;At last,&quot; he said 
          to no one in particular, &quot;I have found peace.&quot;<p>
        </p>
        <p>IV</p>
        <p>In his dream he was swimming beneath the waves with three beautiful 
          mermaids. The water was clear warm and full of exotic and strange creatures. 
          The further he descended the less chance he knew he'd have for returning 
          to the world from whence he'd come. But the mermaids had seduced him 
          and he was now himself changing. His legs began to merge into one, his 
          genitals withdrew into his body and he felt his internal organs adapt 
          to the obstacle of underwater existence. Suddenly the nearest mermaid 
          swam up to him and kissed him on the lips. As she did so he felt a new 
          sensation pass through his transforming body. His legs had now become 
          one long scaly tail and his need to breath in oxygen was replaced with 
          an ability to breathe underwater. Below him a sudden darkness began 
          to appear, but still he descended, following the three mermaids until 
          he could see neither them nor any other creature. Then, suddenly he 
          was back in the body of a human. Panic struck as he gasped for air, 
          his legs and arms thrusting out in a vain attempt to reach the distant 
          surface. Suddenly the nearest mermaid swam toward him. He signalled 
          to her for help, but she merely returned his gaze with a long and sinister 
          smile. Suddenly with a rapid thrust of her tail she set upon him, razor 
          sharp talons and shark-like teeth tearing into his flesh, drawing blood 
          and causing fatal damage. Within moments he was falling uncontrollably 
          into the deeper and ever growing darkness, blood spewing from gaping 
          wounds, a signal for other bottomless creatures to feast upon another 
          casualty of the watery depths.<p>
          He awoke with a start, sweat covered and disturbed by the dream sequence 
          that he'd just undergone. He took a deep breath, held it and then breathed 
          out long and hard. Clearly the dream had been archetypal, but what did 
          it mean exactly? He wondered. Glancing about him he momentarily forgot 
          the nightmare as he took in his surroundings. It was still dark, but 
          thick heavy velvet curtains had been closed so it was likely that the 
          darkness was merely an effect of the closed curtains rather than an 
          indication of the real time of day. He was lying in a four-poster bed, 
          but didn't recollect coming to this room, or getting himself into bed. 
          He remembered getting into the bath with the three water nymphs. There 
          had been others in the room, yes, four nuns all standing in a pose of 
          self-awareness. He'd let himself lie back and the water had proved extremely 
          buoyant, the nymphs had massaged him and then all was vague. Something 
          about the nuns dancing around him, had they discarded their robes? They 
          had made love to one another and he remembered wishing he could join 
          in, but he was strapped to a wall, again helpless before the vision 
          of desire, someone had kissed him, a tongue had lapped at his manhood. 
          A hot cream stung as it was massaged into his body, his mind felt afire. 
          His astral was so strong and he'd been lifted out of his body, ascending 
          upwards towards the light until he had lost his sense of self and become 
          one with it and then there was no more. <p>
          He relaxed back in his bed. The aches and pains of his body had for 
          once actually gone. Breathing in he noticed that even the tightness 
          in his chest had seemed to disappear. Lifting the covers a little he 
          looked down at his member. Strange to think that the evening before 
          he had been under the control of a group of very attractive women, who 
          could have done anything they wanted with him. God what a turn on he 
          thought to himself. &quot;They must have known, because I had a hard 
          on for most of it.&quot; He said grinning to himself. <p>
          His thoughts returned to the dream trying to find an explanation. Three 
          mermaids take him into the depths, he transforms and then suddenly turns 
          back into human form and is devoured by the monsters. Clearly it was 
          archetypal, the great depths being the unconscious, the mermaids being 
          guides on his journey. But then they had devoured him. But only after 
          he had turned back into human form. Of course! It directly relates to 
          my current journey. If I turn back to the ways of the uninitiated I 
          will be devoured by my subconscious and its lies, symbolised by the 
          shark-like mermaid, but if I accept the transformation then I will be 
          able to continue onwards and finally achieve a level of spiritual transformation, 
          which is akin to me being a creature and inhabitant of the world beyond 
          the world. <p>
          V<p>
          Pulling back the covers he quickly got out of bed and went over to the 
          window to see if it was indeed daylight, there were no clocks in the 
          room so he had to rely on his intuition and what he could see of the 
          sun. Pulling back the curtains daylight poured into the room. It was 
          overcast and the cloud seemed to remain motionless as though hanging 
          heavily above the house and grounds. His room had a view of the rear 
          gardens and he stood there for a moment looking out over the lawns. 
          Involuntarily he shivered and glanced back into the room his eyes intent 
          on locating some clothes, less he end up with a chill which wouldn't 
          bode too well. <p>
          Turning back he made his way over to the wardrobe which was situated 
          by the door. It was empty except for a plain black robe, which he decided 
          was easily better than nothing at all. So he pulled it on over his head 
          and shoulders. At first it seemed to fit perfectly, but then he realised 
          that it was crotchless. Looking behind him he saw that the behind had 
          also been cut out, exposing the wearers loins and backside. The previous 
          evening he'd found it a turn on, but even this was pushing it a bit 
          too far and there was little chance of maintaining any dignity when 
          the only clothing he could find was a crotchless black robe. <p>
          Accepting his predicament he wandered back over to the window and continued 
          his survey of the grounds. The gardens themselves looked pretty spectacular 
          with circular and square-shaped flowerbeds positioned in-between either 
          small streams with stepping stones serving as pathways or sections of 
          short cut grass. A large seven sided pond was positioned further away, 
          with a huge phallus shaped conifer tree centred upon an island in its 
          centre. Beyond that various statues carved in stone were positioned 
          within a hedged maze and beyond that a wood where he spotted a few horse 
          riders riding in an out of the trees. A knock at his door brought him 
          back to his immediate environment.<p>
          &quot;Come in.&quot; He said. <p>
          The door was pushed open and a young Spanish maid entered carrying a 
          tray of food. &quot;I have brought you breakfast,&quot; she said in 
          an appropriate Spanish accent her attention focused on the breakfast 
          tray. <p>
          &quot;Thank you.&quot; He said aware immediately of the predicament 
          of his exposure and pulling his robe around so that he was no longer 
          exposed. She was another stunningly attractive woman, just like most 
          of the women here he thought to himself. &quot;Am I not allowed to eat 
          in the dining room then?&quot;<p>
          &quot;No.&quot; She replied, her answer short and directly to the point. 
          As she lent forward to put the tray down on the dressing table to the 
          left of his bed, he noticed her dress rise up a little and could just 
          see her stocking tops. He felt sleazy but slightly aroused.<p>
          Once the tray was safely placed she turned to look at him &quot;You 
          not supposed to be wearing that,&quot; she said indicating to his robe.<p>
          &quot;But there is nothing else for me to wear,&quot; he protested, 
          &quot;I don't know where my clothes are and no one has provided me with 
          anything suitable, I've.&quot; he cut himself off, not wishing to divulge 
          his continual naked status to a mere maid. &quot;You supposed to be 
          naked until they ready to give you clothes.&quot; She said looking him 
          directly in the eye, &quot;you take it off now, before the Sisters catch 
          you, they not like you wearing clothes until you are ready.&quot;<p>
          Her manner was far more authoritarian than he would have expected from 
          a maid perhaps this was another test.<p>
          &quot;Anyway, you like not having clothes on in front of women.&quot; 
          The maid said seemingly more aware of his sexual desires than he would 
          have expected, &quot;you like having your willy exposed before woman. 
          But you take it off now, or you get us both into trouble.&quot;<p>
          If this was a test what was the correct action to take he quickly thought 
          to himself. If he took it off, he was submitting himself even to a supposedly 
          lowly maid, if he didn't then he was proving his masculinity, the dominance 
          of the male over the female and so far the scenario had been that the 
          male had to submit before the female. The symbolism was clear the passivity 
          of the masculine principle itself representing the ego to the passivity 
          of the feminine representing the hidden spiritual self. &quot;You take 
          it off now,&quot; the maid repeated taking a step towards him. &quot;I'm 
          just thinking&quot; He said looking at her and deducing that she would 
          most likely win one way or another.<p>
          &quot;You take it off before I get into trouble.&quot; She said still 
          moving towards him. &quot;Okay, okay,&quot; he said gambling on whether 
          or not he was being tested, but even if he wasn't he knew that her words 
          were true and he really did relish the idea of being naked before a 
          clothed woman. He began to pull the robe over his head just as the maid 
          reached him. She stopped and waited for him to disrobe. When he was 
          naked she put out her hand for him to pass her the robe. As she waited, 
          she took a long and deliberately slow look over his body, ensuring that 
          he was aware of her gaze. Her eyes lingered for a long time on his manhood 
          and he watched her lightly flick her tongue over her lips before she 
          caught his gaze once more and smiled. His face went red and he could 
          feel his heart again beat a little faster, his cock twitched and she 
          looked back down at it as it slowly and involuntarily rose to attention. 
          &quot;You not had release yet.&quot; She said taking the final step 
          towards him so that her body was touching him, &quot;you be patient,&quot; 
          she said her voice softer now as she reached down and took his manhood 
          in her hand, &quot;but no masturbation, you keep seed inside you.&quot; 
          She said squeezing him tightly. She let him go and with his discarded 
          robe in hand, left the room.<p>
          He heard a key turn and be withdrawn from the lock and then he was left 
          in silence. He was still hard and without thought took himself in hand. 
          He felt so aroused, but had found nothing but erotic teasing from a 
          lot of extremely sensual and dominant women. His hand moved along his 
          shaft, slowly at first then rapidly increasing in pace as he realised 
          how much he needed release. Another sound at the door startled him, 
          but despite the sound of a key being inserted and turned indicating 
          an imminent intrusion he couldn't stop himself. The door opened and 
          he looked over, still wanking himself as two young women quickly strode 
          into the room. Their clothes startled him as they both wore green combat 
          trousers; black well polished army boots, white sleeveless T-shirts 
          and black berries. For all intents and purposes they could have been 
          straight out of a Para-military organisation. His heart beat faster 
          as they took swift confident strides across the room to him. The one 
          that reached him first yanked his hand away from his cock.<p>
          &quot;You're not supposed to be doing that.&quot; She said in an American 
          accent. She was young, 18 most likely but possibly a little older. <p>
          &quot;No masturbation.&quot; The second one said in what sounded like 
          a light Jamaican accent giving his hand a slap.<p>
          &quot;Oh god,&quot; he said, &quot;please I'm almost bursting.&quot;<p>
          &quot;No masturbation.&quot; The lightly bronzed Jamaican repeated as 
          she gripped his other wrist. He saw a third female enter, clothed in 
          similar attire, save that her berry was red instead of black. He presumed 
          it meant that she was in a higher position of authority than the other 
          two. In her hand was a long chain which as soon as she was within reach 
          she proceeded to use to cuff his hands behind his back. &quot;Oh not 
          again, please.&quot; He said struggling. The two black berry's had obviously 
          trained in some form of martial art as he found it impossible to struggle 
          against them and so, was once again handcuffed and defenceless. &quot;If 
          you cannot contain your own desires then we shall contain them for you.&quot; 
          The red-berry said in a well-spoken English accent. &quot;There is much 
          to be done yet, before you get carried away by your desires and think 
          what those words mean.&quot; She said instructing him in a manner that 
          many would not understand. He looked at her and could see that she, 
          like her two compatriots wore no bra underneath her tea shirt. &quot;We 
          are not for you.&quot; She said aware of his gaze. &quot;There will 
          be time enough in the future when you may again enjoy the consort of 
          many that you see before you, but for now you must go without.&quot; 
          She nodded to the two women holding him and they pulled him back onto 
          the bed. Either he hadn't noticed or they had been hidden, but two more 
          cuffs were then attached to his wrists, the former cuffs having a locking 
          chain mechanism that upon release enabled his arms to stretch outwards. 
          As his wrists were bound to the bed, the officer in charge bound his 
          ankles in turn. &quot;Now, we will see how strong your self control 
          really is.&quot; She said, looking from his now declining penis to his 
          eyes. And with that he was once more left alone. <p>
          VI<p>
          Silently he awaited the next test, but no one came and he was left bound 
          and naked upon the four poster bed. Now and again he heard voices, laughter, 
          a car or motor vehicle start up and drive off. The birds sang their 
          final chorus of the day as daylight progressed through dusk into darkness 
          and the light in his room was chased away by the onset of night. He 
          remained undisturbed and eventually drifted into a deep and dreamless 
          sleep. <p>
          &quot;Paul, Paul,&quot; the voice spoke gently, urging him out of his 
          sleep. &quot;Paul.&quot; The third call brought him back to consciousness. 
          Sitting beside him on the bed was the beautiful Mistress that had presided 
          over his initiation. In contradistinction to her earlier more dominant 
          and erotic form of clothing, she wore a long black baggy woollen dress 
          that served to hide the contours of her body. &quot;Who are you?&quot; 
          He asked, his mind still subconsciously questioning the validity of 
          this whole experience. His bindings had been undone and he was lying 
          underneath the covers though he was still naked.<p>
          &quot;I am here to remind you of your past.&quot;<p>
          &quot;My past?&quot;<p>
          &quot;Have you forgotten already? Surely you cannot have forgotten the 
          path that you have followed?&quot;<p>
          &quot;No, I've tried to forget,&quot; he said feeling somewhat like 
          an actor in a tragedy. &quot;You mustn't forget, that is your path and 
          it has led you to us. Few succeed in this journey, but within you lies 
          the seed of greater awareness. It is up to you to utilise it.&quot; 
          &quot;I was looking for this my whole life, but I thought it was just 
          a fantasy, another day-dream.&quot;<p>
          &quot;There is much for you to do, though you do not realise this. That 
          is why you are here. But you have a question for me.&quot;<p>
          A question? His mind went blank as he tried to think what it was that 
          he wanted to know. If she really was a genuine Mistress and had passed 
          through the Abyss then it was important to ask a meaningful question, 
          rather than one that he could determine the answer for himself.<p>
          &quot;It has been difficult to adjust to a life without the Left. There 
          is something wrong and I cannot seem to transfer from the Old Path to 
          the New. The Old has left such a deep impression upon me. But I could 
          never fully walk it, still there was something in the way. What is it?&quot;<p>
          &quot;You know the answer to your question even when you ask. So why 
          ask a question you already know the answer to? Why not ask what you 
          really need to know?&quot; He thought about her answer, aware of the 
          truth in her words and the fact that despite his insight he'd still 
          asked the wrong question. He did know what had prevented him both in 
          the past and in the present. It was within him as it was within all 
          who lived. That being that the knowing Christians had called Satan. 
          Those of the Left who had known the truth also had a name for him though 
          it varied from group to group. &quot;How do I overcome it?&quot;<p>
          &quot;That is what we are here for. We are here to show you the way 
          across the abyss and past the demon that has ruled you all your life. 
          Here, I give you a gift. Hold out your hand.&quot;<p>
          He did as instructed and she passed him a pendant and chain. &quot;This 
          will mark the path for your future, do not forget your past.&quot; She 
          said suddenly getting up from the bed. She made for the door, glancing 
          back at him as he looked at the gift she had given him. In his hand 
          he held a circular piece of gold metal inscribed upon which was a triangle 
          and within that the Greek words 'En To Pan'. &quot;All is One.&quot; 
          He said out loud as the door closed behind the Mistress and she smiled 
          at the two sisters waiting in the hallway.<p>
          &quot;The first stage is nearing completion.&quot; She said. <p>
          &quot;Will he be ready for the final stage?&quot; The first one asked.<p>
          &quot;He will, he knows enough already to undergo the change.&quot;<p>
          &quot;He just needs the guidance.&quot; The second sister said.<p>
          &quot;Guidance and discipline.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Yes, he needs to know his place.&quot;<p>
          &quot;That is what we are here for my sister,&quot; the Mistress said, 
          &quot;to show men their place in the scheme of the Creator.&quot;<p>
          &quot;May Sophia guide our school.&quot;<p>
          VII<p>
          He sat and thought for a while. He'd been led here by an attractive 
          and strange brunette who he'd met in an empty church. He'd been tricked, 
          stripped, bound, humiliated, aroused and initiated all without a question 
          of whether he wanted to or not. He was it had seemed an unwillingly 
          victim in a sorority's sex game. But that was merely a surface impression. 
          Clearly they knew what made him tick, especially when it came to sex, 
          but they also knew about the mysteries. The eyes of the nuns, the words 
          of the Mistress, the symbolism of the ritual and now the pendant, symbolising 
          among other things the endlessness of the Great Being, the achievement 
          of crossing the abyss, internal and external wholeness and unity. All 
          of this seemed to indicate that they knew a lot more than a lot of other 
          occult groups and hadn't he looked for long enough to try and find a 
          genuine group? And he'd found one, maybe two. But even one of them had 
          proved to be based in fantasy and he'd travelled a long way down that 
          road, lying to himself as he went, but happy and content to live in 
          his fantasy world. But here, this was a different matter. Here there 
          was certainly a potential for something far greater.<p>
          He lay back and closed his eyes again. The soft pillows cushioned his 
          head and the bed felt so comfortable and warm. His right hand once again 
          descended to his groin and he rested it upon his cock which hardened 
          as he drifted off once more into a deep sleep.<p>
          The spiders were all over the room. Involuntarily his body shivered. 
          He didn't like spiders, never had really. He could face them, objectively 
          try and face up to his fears, but he'd had some extremely bad nightmares 
          involving huge spiders. He remembered one time when he'd awoken with 
          a start, leaping out of bed certain that a massive spider was resting 
          just above his bed. He'd been convinced that it was the result of his 
          dark workings, but still he'd continued. This was different though. 
          The room was practically empty but many small spiders were rushing around 
          the room, up the walls, along the floor, across the ceiling until eventually 
          they'd started to clamber up his legs. At that point he woke up, the 
          disturbing dream replaced by another disturbing image. Disturbing for 
          the fact that it was real. About him stood a group red robed figures, 
          they were all of consistent height and their cowls were pulled up over 
          their heads. During his sleep he'd been uncovered and bound once more, 
          defenceless again amidst the sorority.<p>
          VIII<p>
          &quot;It is time for your submission.&quot; A female voice at the foot 
          of the bed spoke. &quot;You have been waiting for this,&quot; a soft 
          female voice said as the figure leant forward and took his cock in hand. 
          <p>
          He became aroused as the hand pulled his foreskin slowly down his shaft. 
          &quot;Look, he is becoming hard again.&quot; He recognised the voice, 
          it was the Jamaican soldier from earlier. <p>
          &quot;But how long will he last?&quot; A voice that he didn't recognise 
          asked. &quot;We shall have to wait and see.&quot; The voice at the end 
          of the bed said. That was a voice he did remember it was the English 
          officer from earlier and she was evidently in command.<p>
          The hand on his penis had begun moving slowly back and forth, pulling 
          his foreskin upwards and downwards, at one stroke exposing his glands, 
          another covering them over again.<p>
          He gasped. The hand wanked him slowly, the eyes of the robed women intently 
          watching the erotic manipulations of their sister.<p>
          &quot;He likes that doesn't he.&quot; One of them giggled.<p>
          &quot;Look he's going to cum.&quot; The Jamaican said.<p>
          &quot;He didn't last long did he.&quot; It was the short female to his 
          right that spoke. From the sound of her voice he estimated that she 
          was another teenager. &quot;Are they all like that?&quot; She asked, 
          directing the question to no one in particular. The woman beside her 
          whispered a quiet answer, &quot;Some last longer than others, but they 
          have all been through a heightened state of sexual eroticism, so it 
          is to be expected that they do not last long once they are touched by 
          a female hand.&quot;<p>
          &quot;I've never seen a man cum before,&quot; the young girl said giggling. 
          <p>
          No one answered.<p>
          &quot;Don't bring him off yet,&quot; instructed the leader, &quot;he 
          must experience the sight first.&quot; All about him a slow and beautiful 
          chant was begun as the woman who was masturbating him slowed her hand 
          rhythm down to an almost stop. Holding his retracted foreskin for a 
          few moments before ever so slowly pulling it back up the long veined 
          shaft and then holding it there for a few moments before repeating the 
          whole cycle.<p>
          Directly above him a white mist began to form, initially remaining formless 
          until it gradually moulded itself into a strange unearthly feminine 
          being. A long Aryan face, long pointed elfin ears, intense staring eyes. 
          She was naked and her breasts hung down almost touching his chest. A 
          tongue flicked seductively over full lips. The hand on his cock continued 
          its incredibly slow pace of stimulation. As best he could he thrust 
          upwards subconsciously desiring union with this strange succubus.<p>
          The chant continued, the female cantors obviously intent upon increasing 
          the level of energy in the room. Beyond the succubus an open doorway 
          appeared, beyond which golden steps led to a marble plateau upon which 
          a golden throne was positioned, it's back towards him so that he was 
          unable to see whether it seated an occupant. Suddenly he was out of 
          his body and ascending the steps, a voice counted the number as he progressed 
          upwards. One, two, three. The succubus ascended a few steps ahead of 
          him, every now and again looking back at him, indicating for him to 
          follow her to the top. Twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two. In the distance, 
          somewhere behind him he heard a slow and beautiful chant being sung 
          by a female choir. He looked back and saw a figure masturbating his 
          naked and bound body, about him a group of red robed figures stood motionless. 
          Thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty. He'd reached the plateau. The succubus 
          had vanished. He moved towards the chair which slowly turned to greet 
          him. The seated figure startled him. Naked, winged, muscular, masculine, 
          a long face with dark eyes that looked deep into his soul and made him 
          shake involuntarily. &quot;I left you behind.&quot; Paul said questioning 
          the validity of the vision before him. &quot;I am always with you and 
          you know that as truth.&quot; The figure replied grinning, sharp and 
          dangerous teeth apparent. <p>
          &quot;Oh God, where are you?&quot; Paul asked looking up into the sky 
          beyond the figure. <p>
          &quot;I am here.&quot; The figure replied. <p>
          &quot;You are Satan and I no longer serve you.&quot; <p>
          &quot;If that is so, then why did you find me here?&quot; Satan asked 
          suddenly standing, his long reptilian wings nearly touching the marble 
          floor. &quot;I don't know. I never really sought you. I was looking 
          for something else.&quot;<p>
          &quot;You were looking for lies.&quot;<p>
          &quot;This is wrong,&quot; Paul said backing away from him. &quot;This 
          is wrong, something is wrong.&quot;<p>
          &quot;You are wrong,&quot; Satan suddenly snarled at him, a cloud of 
          blackness spreading out into the atmosphere directly around him, &quot;fool, 
          you sought me and found what?&quot;<p>
          &quot;I.&quot;<p>
          &quot;You found your own nothingness,&quot; Satan interrupted, &quot;and 
          still you hide behind bullshit,&quot; blatant contempt in his voice.<p>
          In his heart Paul felt the truth. &quot;I am nothing.&quot; He said. 
          He'd known this before, sensed it within himself. The falsity of it 
          all. How everything and everyone was hiding behind what they were not. 
          &quot;I am nothing.&quot; He repeated as he fell to knees. &quot;God, 
          I am nothing. I am nothing.&quot; <p>
          &quot;You are nothing.&quot; Satan repeated staring with intensity at 
          the naked form of the initiate before him. &quot;Even this form is not 
          you. Can you not even see beyond form yet? Fool! You who are nothing! 
          Fool! You who are blind to the true Mysteries! Fool! You who hide behind 
          what you are not. Fool! You are nothing!&quot; Each sentence cut him 
          like a whip thrashed across his back. Finally Paul raised his gaze to 
          look firstly at Satan, &quot;You are a teacher, but you are nothing 
          also.&quot; Then casting his gaze skywards he asked the question that 
          he had always sought an answer to. &quot;What am I?&quot; White clouds 
          passed across the canvas of the blue sky, pushed by a high and distant 
          wind, but no answer came.<p>
          The vision faded, replaced by the red-robed Servants of the Goddess. 
          He was limp now, semen spilled upon his stomach and over the hand of 
          the masturbator who had carefully wiped it off into a glass jar. <p>
          &quot;I am nothing.&quot; He said his gaze unfocused. The sisters stood 
          for a moment or two, quiet and unmoving until the lead sister indicated 
          for them to leave. In silence the masturbator undid his bindings as 
          the others left, then she too followed them out of the room closing 
          the door behind her, leaving only the well spoken English sister alone 
          in the room with Paul.<p>
          &quot;You have found the question.&quot; She said as she moved toward 
          him, &quot;We are here to provide the answer that has eluded you all 
          this time.&quot; As she walked toward him she pulled down a zip at the 
          front of her robe, enabling it to fall from her shoulders onto the carpet. 
          Stepping out of it she was naked, her breasts firm, nipples erect. &quot;Now,&quot; 
          she said climbing onto the bed, &quot;I have the honour to be your first. 
          Let us find the truth together.&quot;</p>
