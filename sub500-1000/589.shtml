              <p>One night you hear a gentle but persistent tap at your window, 
                you curiousity is up so you glance out the window. You see me 
                standing there in the moonlight, motioning for you to get dressed 
                and come outside. When you walk outside, I talk your hand, giving 
                you a light kiss on the cheek. I slowly start leading you to the 
                car, you start asking where we are going. I tell you that it is 
                a surprise, with a shy sleek smile on my lips. Leading you to 
                the car, I open the door for you, still holding your hand. I help 
                you into the car, and after giving your a hand a kiss, gently 
                secure the door. Getting in on the other side, I start up the 
                car, starting to back out, you ask again where? The only answer 
                you see is that shy smile. We drive for a little while, eventually 
                pulling into a dark parking lot. </p>
              <p>There are no lights on in the parking lot, or on the building. 
                You curiousity is going, as I park and turn off the car. Walking 
                around to your side, I open your door and take your hand to help 
                you get out of the car. Walking to the front door, I knock what 
                seemed to be a pattern and a couple of minutes later, you hear 
                the door unlock. Waiting just a couple of seconds, I open the 
                door for you. You wonder who could've umlocked the door, You notice 
                at first that the inside is almost as dark as the outside. I lead 
                you through the building, Walking around what vaguely looks like 
                tables and chairs. Then after a couple of minutes, I stop and 
                help you to sit down in a chair. Giving you a gentle kiss on the 
                check, I say, that I will be back in just a few of minutes, for 
                you just to sit here. Then I disappear into the darkness, you 
                look around, still able to make out vague outlines of tables and 
                chairs, but not a lot more. <br>
                At first it starts as just little more than a whisper, than slowly 
                the volume increases as a single light appear to the front of 
                you, turning you notice a stage, and standing there is someone 
                with his back to you. You immediately know that it is me, even 
                though all you see is my back, I am standing there in black leather 
                pants, shining in the light. Hugging tight to the muscles of my 
                legs and my ass. On top , I have on a black silk shirt, hanging 
                loose from my shoulders. My head is turned just slightly your 
                way, but you still can not see my face, my hair is hanging just 
                enough to hide, the lust in my eyes. </p>
              <p>As the tempo starts, my hips slowly start moving to the music 
                <br>
                &quot;Time, it needs time <br>
                To win back your love again <br>
                I will be there, I will be there&quot; </p>
              <p>Turning to face you, you see me looking at you, staring straight 
                into your eyes. My hands moving slowly with the music, slowly 
                running over my chest, just like your hands would be. Slowly making 
                my way to be right in front of you, I start undoing one button 
                at a time of the shirt. Starting at the top, slowly revealing 
                my smooth hard chest for your gaze. Reaching the bottom button 
                just a I get a couple of feet infront of you. Rotating my hips 
                with the beat, I let the shirt slowly slide off of my shoulders. 
                While my hips are rotating with the music, I slide my hands from 
                the top of my leather pants, across my stomach, up to my chest. 
                Picturing in my mind that it is your hands, up to my neck and 
                it to my hair. </p>
              <p>&quot;Love, only Love <br>
                Can bring back your love someday <br>
                I will be there, I will be there&quot; </p>
              <p>Standing right in front of you, I slowly kneel between your legs. 
                Putting my hands on the edge of your chair, I slowly start to 
                raise back up. Letting my hair slowly slide across your legs. 
                As I get about even with your face, I lift your hands from your 
                sides. Letting them glide over my smooth hard chest, letting them 
                feel ever muscle, in my chest. </p>
              <p>&quot;I'll fight, babe, I'll fight. <br>
                To win back your love again <br>
                I will be there, I will be there <br>
                Love, only Love <br>
                Can break down the wall someday <br>
                I will be there, I will be there&quot; </p>
              <p>Taking your hands, I slowly lower them to the side of the leather 
                pants. Putting your hand on the zipper that is one the side, while 
                I am still moving my hips back and forth to the music. You slowly 
                lower the zipper to my knee. Raising my leg, and putting my foot 
                delicately in between your legs on the chair, you lower it the 
                rest of the way to the bottom. Moving back a step of two, my hands 
                sliding across my stomach to the other side. Standing at a slight 
                angle to you, I lower the other side slowly, bending slight at 
                the waist. The leather of the pants being pulled tight against 
                my ass. till the zipper is all the way down. </p>
              <p>&quot;If we'd go again all the way from the start <br>
                I would try to change the things that killed our Love <br>
                Your pride has built a wall, <br>
                So strong that I can't get through <br>
                Is there really no chance, to start once again <br>
                I'm Loving you&quot; </p>
              <p>Undoing the two straps on the sides, I stand there grinding my 
                hips in a slow circle with the music. My hands holding the side 
                of the pants together. Releasing with one hand, the side falling 
                away to almost reveal evertything. Sliding my hand slowly from 
                my hip, up to my chest. your eyes following it. See just a slight 
                sheen to my chest were you can see me taking ever single breath. 
                The excitement showing in the quickness of my breath, knowing 
                that you are the only one that is witnessing this. Turning to 
                the side, I let go of the other strap, letting the leather fall 
                to a pile on the floor betwee my legs. </p>
              <p>&quot;Try, baby, Try <br>
                To trust in my Love again <br>
                I will be there, I will be there <br>
                Love, our Love <br>
                Just shouldn't be thrown away <br>
                I will be there, I will be there&quot; </p>
              <p>Standing there in just a black g-string, you see all the muscles 
                of my legs and ass, as they tighten with each gyration. Turning 
                to face you, I move back to in front of you, My hands laced behind 
                my head, still slowly moving my hips in a slow circle. Looking 
                deep, into your eyes, I slowly lick my lips, making them shine 
                in the light. Slowly sliding my hands down my neck, feeling the 
                muscles in my chest. </p>
              <p>&quot;If we'd go again <br>
                All the way from the start <br>
                I would try to change the things that killed our Love <br>
                Your pride has built a wall, so strong <br>
                That I can't get through <br>
                Is there really no chance <br>
                To start once again&quot; </p>
              <p>Reaching down for your hands, I slowly help you to stand. Turning 
                you around, and lacing my arms around your waist. Feeling my body, 
                pulled tight against your. Feeling my heartbeat and breath, and 
                other things, that show you my excitement. Holding your hips against 
                mine, slowly start going in a little circle. My groin pressed 
                firmly against that small tight ass. You can feel me getting even 
                more excited. Feeling your heart beat racing to match my own. 
              </p>
              <p> &quot;If we'd go again <br>
                All the way from the start <br>
                I would try to change the things that killed our Love <br>
                Yes, I've hurt your pride, and I know <br>
                What you've been through <br>
                You should give me a chance&quot; </p>
              <p>Your hands are around your back, gripping my ass, pulling me 
                even tighter against you. Slowly sliding my hands from your waist, 
                across your stomach. Softly feeling the firmness and weight of 
                your perfect breasts, through your shirt. Feeling your nipples 
                hard against the palms of my hands. I gently roll them between 
                my fingertips. </p>
              <p> &quot;This can't be the end <br>
                I'm still Loving you <br>
                I'm still Loving you, I need your Love <br>
                I'm still Loving you&quot; </p>
              <p>As the music starts to die down, I gently turn you to face me. 
                Taking your face gently in my hands, seeing the shine of pure 
                passion in my eyes. I slowly lick the outer edges of your lips, 
                making them shine like my body does in the lights. Slowly teasing 
                the tip of your tongue with mine, the giving your a slow deep 
                passionate kiss. Our tongues intertwined, I let yours slowly pass 
                between my lips and lightly suck on it, Still slowly caressing 
                it with mine.</p>
