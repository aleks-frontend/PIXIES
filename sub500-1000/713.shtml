        <p>As her lips drew nearer I sighed. This is the moment I had been dreaming 
          about for almost a year. Her lips touched mine and it was like an electric 
          current ran between her body and mine. As our tongues explored each 
          others mouths all I could think of is finally her.. the woman that I 
          have wanted for what seemed like an eternity. My fingers went up to 
          caress her cheeks and threaded themselves into her silken blonde hair. 
          I pulled her to me to feel the heat of her body against mine . As we 
          danced to a slow song the whole rest of the club was forgotten. Our 
          bodies creating a passion neither of us had ever felt before. I spoke 
          in her ear pleading for her to come home with me. &quot;I want to worship 
          you as you deserve, I want to make love to you all night long and curl 
          up next you when our passions are sated&quot; I whispered. My heart 
          fluttered as I awaited her answer. &quot;Please don't say no&quot; I 
          begged her. I could see that she was torn but all rational thought had 
          left me. I knew that I had to have her no matter the consequences. She 
          agreed though I could see that she was in conflict over it. I vowed 
          to myself to make her forget her reasons for not wanting to come. As 
          we left the bar the chill in the air seemed nothing to me because of 
          the heat within my body. I could not ever remember being this sexually 
          excited. The drive to my place seemed torturous in length. I held her 
          hand and stroked her thigh as I drove wanting to keep her passion ignited. 
          When we reached the apartment I practically dragged her up the stairs 
          in my haste. I could not believe that I had the woman of my dreams in 
          my house. I had dreamed of this moment so many times but now it seemed 
          as I was almost shy. I felt a little unsure of myself and what to do 
          next although I had went over this moment in my imagination a million 
          times. She seemed to sense my hesitation and drew me to her to kiss 
          those beautiful lips once again. My head bent to hers tasting her sweet 
          mouth, my tongue darting between her lips parting them. I drew her tongue 
          inside my mouth and sucked it gently almost reverently. I led her to 
          the bedroom by the hand and when we reached the side of the bed I pushed 
          her against it genlty and started to run my hands down her chest. She 
          looked into my eyes and I could see my passion mirrored there in those 
          beautiful brown eyes. My whole body tingled with sexual electricity 
          and I felt as though if I should die this very moment I would be perfectly 
          contented. She put her hands on my arms and deftly switched places with 
          me becoming the aggresor. She placed her fingers on the buttons of my 
          shirt and expertly opened the entire row before I could register what 
          was happening. I shrugged the shirt down my arms and she placed her 
          hands on my breasts through the cups of my bra. I felt as though I could 
          cum all over myself from this contact small as it was. My body shuddered 
          slightly and a smile played across her lips. She quickly removed my 
          bra and my breasts fell into her waiting hands. As she massaged the 
          globes her fingers brushed across my nipples causing them to stiffen. 
          Her head dipped to my chest and I thought I would swoon from the anticipation. 
          As her lips drew my nipple in my hands stroked her back in random patterns. 
          I placed my hands under her shirt and drew it up as her mouth continued 
          to excite my nipple making it harder than I ever thought possible. She 
          broke the contact to allow me to pull her shirt over her head. My lustful 
          gaze fell upon her chest which was now exposed to me. She took the oppurtunity 
          to start unfastening my jeans and as they fell to the floor she quickly 
          dispatched of her own. We embraced again enjoying the feel of our skin 
          brushing together. I could see the wetness upon her thighs and mound 
          and knew that she was excited as I was. We climbed upon the bed and 
          lay next to each other our hands exploring each others bodies as our 
          lips met once again. She broke the kiss and licked her way down my throat 
          eliciting a moan. Her hands played across my stomach and upper thighs 
          causing my legs to tremble with desire. When her lips met my nipples 
          once again I thought I would pass out from the sheer pleasure of it. 
          My back arched off the bed to offer her all of me as my hands ran through 
          her hair. I never wanted her to end this delicious torture as small 
          moans and sighs came from my lips. Her mouth left my breats drawing 
          a moan of dissapointment from me but then before another word could 
          be said I felt her tongue tracing little patterns across my belly. My 
          flesh felt like one giant bundle of nerves leading directly to my core. 
          Her hands stroked my thighs coming close but never actually touching 
          my wetness. As her tongue flicked across my belly button and dipped 
          inside she brushed her fingertips across the top of my mons. My body 
          stiffened at this contact and my moans pleaded with her for more. Her 
          tongue drew ever nearer and when it traced across my outer lips I thought 
          I would pass out the pleasure was so intense. Her hands continued to 
          stroke my thighs as her lips and tongue played with my outer lips licking 
          up and down just to draw away and do it again. When it seemed as though 
          I could not take this sweet torture anymore she parted my lips with 
          her fingerers and stroked my clit with her expert tongue. Sighs and 
          moans of pleasure tumbled from my lips as she brought me higher and 
          higher in my journey of exctasy. She licked down my cleft and found 
          the entrance to my desire and teased my mercillesly with the tip of 
          tongue until I was pleading with her. As she plunged her tongue inside 
          me my whole body was wracked with an orgasm so powerful I felt as though 
          I was falling off a cliff. My hands desperately grasped at the bed sheets 
          trying to retain my sanity as she began yet another assult at my turgid 
          clit. Her hands kept my thighs parted as she continued to fuck me with 
          her tongue brining me to yet another earth shattering orgasm. She genly 
          licked my juices from my pussy as she let my orgasm ebb away. I pulled 
          at her shoulders to draw her up to me in awe of the skill in which she 
          had gotten me off so quickly and completely. I began to shower her face 
          in kisses tasting myself on her lips. I knew that I was an unskilled 
          innocent in bed compared to her but I was determined to bring her as 
          much pleasure as she did me. I lay her back on the bed as I kissed her 
          earlobe and then sucked it into my mouth. I licked and nipped my way 
          down her neck. I placed butterfly kisses across her collarbone and licked 
          a path to her breasts. As I kissed her breasts and then drew one nipple 
          into my mouth I ran my fingers across the other. I licked across her 
          abdomen letting my desire for her guide me. I could feel her hands on 
          my shoulders urging me ever downward. I could smell the musky scent 
          of her desire and it moved me onward. I kissed her mons worshipping 
          her with my lips. My tongue played across the outside of her lips as 
          my hands drew them apart. My tongue licked her clit and down to her 
          inner lips wanting to taste all of her. As my tongue delved inside her 
          inner walls grasped at my tongue and I could feel her excitement. I 
          hardened my tongue as best I could and thrust in as deeply as possible 
          my nose rubbing against her clit drawing moans of pleasure from her. 
          I licked my way back up to her clit as I found her entrance with my 
          finger. I rubbed my finger up and down her slit as my tongue licked 
          circles around her clit. I slowly worked my finger inside her loving 
          how she felt aroud me. I sucked her clit in my mouth as I started to 
          finger fuck her. I increased the suction on her love button as I began 
          speeding up my finger. I could feel her body starting to tighten and 
          I knew that she was close to orgasm. I quickly placed another finger 
          at her opening and inserted it beside the other as I ernastly licked 
          her clit and sucked at it. Her body shuddered out her orgasm as I withdrew 
          my fingers and replaced them with my tongue not wanting to miss a drop 
          of her juices. I crawled up beside her when her trembling subsided and 
          lay next to her. She enfolded me into her arms and I fell asleep feeling 
          so content, safe and secure that I knew that I never wanted her to leave.</p>
