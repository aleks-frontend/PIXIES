        <p>Pumping. Thumping. Jumping.<p>
          The sun shone on the fields and on the grass as Kirsten jumped and swang 
          and swirled in the mass of all the other revellers at the festival. 
          Around her the sounds of trance and house bounced and beat and thumped 
          and pumped, as she and the others jumped and boogied and grooved and 
          moved. Behind her and on both sides was a sea of dancers, absorbed like 
          herself into the music, letting it take them where it wanted, interpreted 
          by many different wavy hand motions and frantic feet. Ahead of her and 
          hidden by the heads of other dancers and behind his decks was the DJ, 
          Kirsten didn't know who. Not a superstar DJ, but a name DJ nonetheless, 
          caning the old familiar tunes. The swirling sunshine sounds of 'Beachball', 
          an oldie but a goldie, followed, and how did that happen?, by the hard 
          thump of 'Doom's Night'. <p>
          Thumping. Pumping. Kicking. Banging.<p>
          Kirsten was well tooled up. E'd and spiked and sinking into narcotic 
          euphoria. Already her long hair was damp with sweat and it splashed 
          against her bare shoulders. Then the squelch of the first few beats 
          of 'Avenue', punctuated by ecstatic samples from something quite different. 
          She'd been looking forward to this festival forever. Or at least since 
          she and her friends had booked tickets on the net. Somewhere beyond 
          the crowds was their tent, where they'd spent hours chilling out to 
          the sounds on their CD player, passing spliffs between themselves and 
          giggling at the small things which somehow seemed so hilarious. Paul's 
          tee-shirt with the beer stain on it. So fucking funny! And Sophie's 
          hair. Where had she got those weird beads? But all that hanging around, 
          chilling out, getting sorted, that was behind them. The E was kicking 
          in, not that Kirsten was really sure with the haze of dope and booze. 
          She was fucking having it. And fucking having it large. And fucking 
          large it was too.<p>
          Banging. Pumping. Kicking. Moving.<p>
          Gurrh! The E was coming up. She was really rushing. She pressed herself 
          against Barry, who as always was a bit anxious when Kirsten was coming 
          on strong. But fuck him! She was enjoying herself. She grabbed him around 
          the waist, and they boogied together as the swirling cathedral sounds 
          of 'Avenue' made way to some record she recognised but didn't know, 
          vocal sounds breaking in like waves of orgasm through the dense rhythms, 
          in tune with her body as she pressed it hard against Barry, feeling 
          his cock stiffen through the fabric of his shorts.<p>
          Thumping. Banging. Clanging.<p>
          The sun was gradually sinking in the distance and the shadows were getting 
          longer. On the stage the arcing, swaying bright lights became more obvious 
          as a cloud passed in front of the sun. And then a cheer as Paul Van 
          Dyk himself hit the stage. A few brief words from the podium while Kirsten 
          and her friends paused in their dancing, and then at last the decks 
          erupted as the sounds burst forth from the speakers, the heavy bass 
          thundering across the fields as 'Iguana' erupted. Hard house heaven. 
          Kirsten flung herself onto Paul, brushing her tits through her tanktop 
          against his shiny bare chest, his hands and arms twitching with the 
          familiar beats. Sophie was shaking up and down as the rhythms pushed 
          through her, twitching though her from crown to toe. An ecstatic smile 
          on her face was the dead give away that her rush was coming on stronger 
          than ever.<p>
          Grinding. Throbbing. Pulsating.<p>
          And it was Kirsten. As always. Who was the first to pull off her tanktop 
          and let her boobs out into the summer sun, even as it fell beneath the 
          horizon. Kirsten gave a whoop as her round breasts, with their puffy 
          nipples and its satisfying orbs came loose and swayed freely with her 
          body as she swayed freely in the beat. She could see Paul's stare. And 
          she laughed. Paul was so fucking uptight. What did it fucking matter 
          what he fucking thought. She was up for it, whatever he fucking was. 
          Through the sweat that drained off her forehead onto her eyes she could 
          just about see other eyes on her coming from the other dancers, but 
          they were just the ones who weren't really getting it on yet. It felt 
          much better for her tits to bump and wobble and rotate and sway with 
          the music, free as the rest of her. And fuck! What's such a big deal 
          about tits anyway?<p>
          Hopping. Bopping. Sliding. Gliding.<p>
          In through all the trance and hard house came a clear single note, held 
          for a beautiful long moment, gradually building up tension, other rhythms 
          patterning themselves within it, and then bit by bit as Kirsten and 
          Sophie and Paul and Barry sank to the size of midgets on a small corner 
          of the earth, in a vortex of spinning ravers, it built up inexorably 
          and powerfully and ever greater, wave upon wave of emotion and power, 
          to finally climax with beats so heavy and dense that Kirsten could feel 
          her stomach give way beneath her, her long hair swaying onto her breasts 
          and hardening nipples, the ring in her belly-button transmitting hard 
          signals of joy. And then crescendo. Passion. Ecstasy. Emotion. The four 
          of them almost wept as the music carried them up higher and higher, 
          wave upon wave of overlaid beats, crashing and bashing, banging and 
          clanging. Kirsten danced with her head up, mouth open to the sky, as 
          a full moon appeared above her, monstrous and meaningful, the energy 
          pulsing through her as it came onto her and crashed into her.<p>
          Grooving. Moving. Kicking. Killing.<p>
          DJ after DJ. Record after record. Mix after mix. Highs. Lows. Bass. 
          Treble. Rhythms harder than a hammer. Sharper than a knife. Like the 
          knives cutting into her soul. Chemical Heaven. Kirsten pushed herself 
          against Paul again, his own top thrown aside, pressing her hot hard 
          breasts against his hot hard smooth chest, his pierced nipple occasionally 
          slapping against her hot hard nipple. They shimmied and swirled and 
          pirouetted and glided. Flesh against flesh. And Kirsten's hand on his 
          hard cock under his shorts. So long. So thick. And such a good fuck. 
          Kirsten smiled as she remembered their fuck last night. The four of 
          them. Taking turns as the acid wore off and the E kicked in. Not like 
          that shit time with K that time. Paul and Kirsten. Paul and Sophie. 
          Barry and Kirsten. Barry and Sophie. And even for a few giggly awkward 
          moments, while the boys ogled guiltily, Sophie and Kirsten. Was it fun? 
          Maybe. But what the fuck! You're only young once.<p>
          Kicking. Banging. Thumping. Jumping.<p>
          And if not then, why not now? thought Kirsten, as the sounds got fast 
          and furious, the lights flashing over the fields and the stage, dark 
          silhouetted DJs behind decks, films synchronised with the beat on the 
          backdrop. A deep contorted fucked-up beat squeezed itself through the 
          four to the floor, twisted around in her belly, sank into her chest, 
          and released itself as Kirsten pulled Paul's shorts down, his prick 
          standing out tall and proud, pink and purple gloriousness, pride personified. 
          A cock to die for. Paul was too far gone to care, but his dancing became 
          reduced to twitching as his consciousness gradually took in what Kirsten's 
          tongue was doing to his prick at that moment. Slurping, glurping, gasping, 
          gulping. Saliva and sweat. And such a fucking big prick! Would Paul 
          come on her tits? Did she want to waste such goodness?<p>
          Thumping. Pumping. Kicking. Banging.<p>
          Kirsten wasn't sure what she wanted. But the music made demands on her. 
          All at once &quot;Horny! Horny!&quot; crashed the vocals from the mix. 
          Cheesy but so vital. Without any more thought, Kirsten stood up and 
          pulled her own shorts and knickers down, past her pierced crotch and 
          its triangle of light brown hair which belied the truth of her blonde 
          hair, down, down, eased over her bony knees and then kicked off into 
          the grass. She was now naked, except for her light green pumps, a slim 
          bare figure in the moonlight, the rhythms pulsating through her chemically 
          electric frame. Naked. And not for the first time at a festival. Sophie 
          rolled her eyes, but didn't stop her dancing. Barry looked nervous. 
          And Paul looked positively terrified. A few other figures momentarily 
          paused in their dancing. And one or two exchanged comments, but not 
          wanting to look uncool. After all, it was only nudity.<p>
          And Kirsten enjoyed it. The chill air on her burning crotch. The sweat 
          running free down her torso, onto her bare thighs without interruption 
          or pause. Perhaps she was a naturist at heart. But perhaps she didn't 
          go for all that shit. She wasn't going to be spending her time playing 
          beachball and table tennis. She just liked being bare fucking butt naked, 
          and she didn't fucking care what anyone fucking thought. If her parents 
          could see her now. They could just get fucked like everyone else.<p>
          Scraping. Grinding. Twisting. Bumping.<p>
          And there was Paul still jumping and bumping opposite her, his prick 
          slapping from side to side with the rhythm of his dancing. A shame to 
          waste it, thought Kirsten, getting onto the ground, knees in the grass, 
          hands behind his buttocks and prick in her mouth. The taste and smell 
          was overwhelming, while Kirsten's flesh tingled with chemical tension, 
          the prick driving deep into her throat. But not for long. All of a sudden, 
          it erupted into a creamy trail of come, which as his prick withdrew, 
          splattered onto Kirsten's chest and down his legs. Kirsten smiled, as 
          more come dribbled out of her mouth, and then without pause up with 
          the beat, as it took her higher and higher and higher.<p>
          Pumping. Thumping. Hitting hard. Banging on. Relentless. Never ending.<p>
          And then it started to rain. Not for the first fucking time at a festival. 
          The music continued uninterrupted. And who was on stage? Kirsten didn't 
          know. Didn't care. After all those weeks comparing DJs. Was Carl Cox 
          on? Was Judge Jools, Paul Oakenfold, Ferry Corsten, Armand Van Helden? 
          Was it going to be blinding? Or cheesy? Or hard? Or trancey? Who fucking 
          cared? The rain beat down gently, softer than the music, barely noticed 
          on the sweat that already had her hair sodden and damp and lank and 
          sticking to her bare skin. But not for long. Just a shower. Thank fucking 
          Christ for that!<p>
          Bumping. Thumping. Kicking. Heavier. Harder. Darker. Throbbing. Banging.<p>
          How it happened, Kirsten didn't know, but soon there were others like 
          her, naked and boogying, clothes flung aside, more pills appearing and 
          shared and still no break in the dancing. Kirsten bounced off Sophie 
          whose eyes were rolling no longer, her perky pointed nipples as free 
          as Kirsten's fuller rounder boobs. Barry too had pulled down his pants, 
          his thin prick not as proud as Paul's even now, shrivelled into nothing, 
          but shaking madly from side to side. The music pounding and pulling 
          and pushing.<p>
          Perhaps it was Barry. Perhaps it was Sophie. Perhaps it was Kirsten 
          herself. But someone had changed the tempo in their dancing, even though 
          the music was beating to an altogether heavier, faster beat, and they 
          were on the grass, slightly damp after the shower, all three of them, 
          rolling about, kissing and licking each other. And when Barry put his 
          prick in Sophie's cunt, in came Paul, his prick recovering its hardness 
          and straight into Kirsten, as she wrapped her legs around him, and he 
          thrust in and out, with a rhythm totally out of step with the music. 
          Kirsten didn't care. The music was now just in the background. The sounds 
          and rhythms in her skull were red and warm and liquid and tingled with 
          narcotic energy. What the fuck had they been taking? Or was it just 
          how the fancy took them?<p>
          And soon there were others. Kirsten didn't know who they were. She didn't 
          care. Boys. Girls. As long as they had tongues and fingers and lips 
          and pricks where pricks counted. Above them were the shadows of other 
          dancing and twitching energetically in the moonlight, lit up occasionally 
          by the vast strobes of light flashing from the stage. Kirsten occasionally 
          caught snatches of tunes as they thundered by. Was that fucking Fatboy 
          Slim? And later she was sure she heard the distinct beat and vocals 
          of 'Age of Love'. Occasionally, she looked into the faces and not just 
          the bodies of the people gathered around her in this impromptu orgy 
          of theirs. Would she normally have allowed such a fat arsed bloke with 
          his long hair still inside his floppy hat take her up the arse like 
          that? But who fucking cared? It was up there. Pushing up and pushing 
          up, while below Paul (at least she thought it was Paul) was fucking 
          her cunt. And a girl with really short hair was licking her face and 
          eyebrows and cheeks. Kirsten grabbed the girl's face with her hands 
          and tugged it straight into her mouth and tongue fought against tongue.<p>
          Sophie and Barry were also hard at it interlocked by other naked bodies, 
          sometimes flashing purple, blue, yellow or red as the massive strobes 
          passed by. And then back to shadows in the pale moonlight. And then 
          the hard beats of Mauro Piccotto joined the gasps and grunts and slurps 
          and cries of the mass of bodies, building up to a climax of action, 
          as Kirsten herself climaxed again and again and again.<p>
          And then more easy ambient noises from the stage. Bodies sagged and 
          swayed. Exhausted by the dancing, the sex, the sweat. Sampled beats 
          from the orient, interspersed with low ambient vocal cries, and long 
          low hums of sound underlaying the slower rhythm. And bit by bit, person 
          by person, the mass of naked flesh peeled off, Kirsten writhing beneath 
          them. <p>
          Until there was only her. Lying on the grass, as people were making 
          their way home. Her hair was splayed about her, face on one side, breasts 
          on the ground, and legs crossed scissor-fashion behind her. Above her 
          stood Sophie, while Barry and Paul stood off to one side chatting and 
          passing a joint back and forth.<p>
          &quot;Come on, girlfriend,&quot; smiled Sophie. &quot;Get your kit on.&quot;<p>
          Kirsten stood up shakily, her memory of events already fragmented and 
          incomplete. &quot;Did we really&#133;?&quot; <p>
          &quot;Here, Kirsten, have a toke,&quot; insisted Paul, handing her the 
          joint. &quot;You were really way out there.&quot;<p>
          Kirsten put the joint to her lips and breathed in deeply. Too deeply 
          really, as she coughed up most of what she'd taken, but not so much 
          that the affect of the skank was wasted on her.<p>
          &quot;We really got it on there, didn't we? We had a real fucking time, 
          didn't we? It was really banging!&quot; she said with a smile as she 
          looked up with her clothes in a bundle in her arms.<p>
          &quot;Yeah, babe,&quot; said Barry with an ironic smile. &quot;That's 
          the word for it. Banging!&quot;<p>
