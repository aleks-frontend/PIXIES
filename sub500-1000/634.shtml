        <p></p>
        <p>It started out as a typical Saturday, with not much going on except 
          a couple of phone calls that weren't of any consequence. Lounging on 
          my sofa, listening to some music, and reading &quot;Catch-22&quot; seemed 
          like a proper way to allot my time. Steely Dan was wafting through the 
          speakers when there was a soft tapping at my door. I sure as hell hoped 
          it wasn't some damn Jehovah's Witness trying to sell me Jesus. Jesus 
          isn't for sale, as far as I know, and a theological discussion with 
          some naive rube from Arkansas wasn't at the top of my dance card. I 
          turned the music down a bit, and hurriedly pulled on a shirt and opened 
          the door.</p>
        <p> &quot;Hiya Danny!! Surprised?!&quot; she exclaimed, a smile lighting 
          up her enchanting face. I stared at her dumbfounded, and a grin eased 
          onto my face. Beth was a very pretty woman who I was &quot;involved 
          with&quot; in college. She was 27 years old, stood about 5 feet 7 inches 
          tall, and weighed approximately 125 lbs. She had long chestnut brown 
          hair falling lightly to an exquisite ass, wonderfully shaped firm pert 
          breasts, about a 34B, long, slender legs, and a rather angelic face. 
          She was sort of shy when we first met, but dissipated fairly quickly 
          as she met more people and matured intellectually. She eventually became 
          something bordering on assertive. </p>
        <p> &quot;No, not at all. I've been expecting you, Beth,&quot; I told 
          her, the wide grin on my face strongly hinting at the veracity of my 
          claim. &quot;You look very lovely,&quot; I expressed, looking into her 
          blue-gray eyes. She was as beautiful as I had remembered her, perhaps 
          even more so. </p>
        <p> Beth had usually dressed fairly casually when were attending school 
          together, and today was no exception. She had on a pair of old military-surplus 
          fatigues that served to accentuate the alluring shape of her ass, and 
          a simple white t-shirt that made it quite clear there was no bra between 
          her pert breasts and the thin cotton shirt. Her perky nipples made their 
          presence known from beneath the light shirt, subtly pressing through 
          the material. I realized at that moment how much I had missed her. It 
          had been going on five years since I last had seen her elegant face. 
        </p>
        <p><br>
          In the not-so-distant past when we were both attending the University 
          of Arizona, we would spend countless hours talking history, philosophy, 
          and a broad range of other topics, and I believe we both came to appreciate 
          each other's intellects and varied senses of humor. Beth possessed a 
          sense of humor consisting of large portions of irony and sarcasm, and 
          her rapier wit had humbled many an opponent. Many men seem to be put 
          off by a woman with a strong intellect, especially one greater than 
          their own, but I was initially drawn to Beth because of her cerebral 
          nature. Of course, it didn't hurt at all that she was attractive and 
          alluring. I still distinctly remember when the relationship transcended 
          mere intellectual appreciation. </p>
        <p> We were walking home in no hurry from the U of A library in our sophomore 
          year, casually discussing a mid-term exam approaching in one of our 
          more difficult philosophy courses, and without warning she took my hand 
          into her soft grasp. I was rather surprised by this spontaneous event, 
          as ours had been a connection with platonic roots up until that point, 
          although I doubted we would have denied a sexual attraction. </p>
        <p> After Beth took my hand, she looked at me with something resembling 
          a mix of love and ardor in her eyes, and brought her pretty face very 
          slowly towards mine. She smiled softly at me as she swept her hair away 
          from her face, then hesitantly kissed me with her soft lips, very tentatively 
          at first, then with increasing passion as she eased her tongue into 
          my mouth, seeking out my own. It was tender. It was sensuous. It was 
          loving. </p>
        <p> I pulled her close to my body, feeling her firm breasts pressed against 
          my chest, experiencing her warmth while I kissed her deeply, my tongue 
          dancing rhythmically in her mouth. I remember the clean smell of her 
          hair. I recollect the seductive nature of her subtle perfume. We paused 
          from our unanticipated embrace, looking intently into each other's eyes. 
          We then turned in unison, and slowly continued on our way in silence 
          with slight smiles on our faces, my arm around her shoulders. When we 
          got to her door, I kissed her very tenderly on her soft lips as I eased 
          my arm around her petite waist. I reluctantly turned to walk to my apartment, 
          elated at what had just transpired.</p>
        <p> I pondered our initial kiss all of the way back to my small college-ghetto 
          apartment, and into the evening, mulling over where it might lead. Beth's 
          feelings were the same as mine I thought, at least hoped they were. 
          I just didn't want to overstep any unspoken boundaries, as I regarded 
          her as an unparalleled friend first and foremost. She was intelligent, 
          she was stimulating, and she was beautiful in my eyes, and if I could 
          tell anything from the leers she received whenever we ambled across 
          campus together, she was pretty hot in a lot of other guys' eyes as 
          well. </p>
        <p> Over the next several months, it became rather apparent where this 
          romance was evolving. We began to gradually transform into a couple 
          as time progressed. We went to the campus bookstore together when we 
          needed to, we would go to various restaurants and fast food franchises 
          occasionally, and we unfailingly went to our common classes together 
          daily. We hung out on weekends at my apartment, listening to Steely 
          Dan, Elvis Costello, and alternative radio, among other things. We also 
          happened to have in common an avid inclination for the blues. There 
          was a definite shared predilection for each other. </p>
        <p> We hugged and kissed considerably more, in private initially, and 
          we gradually became more public with our affections. We profoundly enjoyed 
          each other's company, and both of us sought out one another on an increasingly 
          frequent basis. Eventually leading up to an evening where Beth found 
          herself alone at her off-campus apartment, as her roommate Monica had 
          left for Cabo San Lucas for spring break. She called to invite me over 
          to her place at 8 o'clock in the evening for, &quot;maybe some coffee, 
          a few drinks...&quot; she giggled, then added cryptically, &quot;and 
          whatever.&quot; I imagined I heard her grinning through the phone. <br>
          <br>
          After showering, shaving quickly and throwing on some cologne, I got 
          dressed and walked the reasonably short distance to her apartment. I 
          proceeded with a leisurely pace to her house, debating whether I was 
          just imagining the implications I thought I heard in her voice on the 
          phone. Beth met me at the door, and after a warm and inviting kiss, 
          welcomed me into her house. She was dressed casually, wearing tight 
          faded Lee jeans, a loose fitting skull-and-roses Grateful Dead t-shirt 
          (she was somewhat of a Deadhead), and was barefooted. I thought I could 
          discern the outline of erect nipples beneath her thin cotton shirt. 
          In my somewhat biased eyes, she was simply beautiful.</p>
        <p> &quot;Hiya Danny. It's great to see you. Come on in,&quot; she said 
          softly with a shy smile, and eyed me at the door. &quot;How are you?&quot; 
          she asked me with an appealing twinkle in her eye. &quot;Gee... you're 
          looking quite dapper... got a date after you leave here tonight?&quot; 
          she teased playfully, referring rather facetiously to my weathered jeans 
          and a somewhat tattered Elvis Costello &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; t-shirt. 
          &quot;That is, *if* you leave here tonight,&quot; I thought I heard 
          her whisper under her breath, and I was pretty sure I had understood 
          what she had said. I kept whatever I might have had to say to myself.</p>
        <p> &quot;Hey Beth. I'm pretty good. Thanks for asking. It's damn good 
          to see you as well, babe,&quot; I said, putting my arm around her and 
          kissing her softly on the lips as I entered the house. &quot;And thank 
          you for the comment on my clothes, babe; I didn't want to outdress you,&quot; 
          I kidded her with a grin. She answered with a practiced smirk and a 
          toothy grin. &quot;Still listening to Jackson Browne, eh?&quot; I asked 
          her rhetorically as I found myself listening to &quot;Late for the Sky&quot; 
          emanating from her speakers, and looked to see her nod her head and 
          softly smile. Beth had a certain fondness for early seventies music.</p>
        <p> We also shared a mutual interest in the sixties. Beth was drawn to 
          acid rock and the alternative lifestyles, i.e., &quot;hippies&quot;, 
          while I was more attracted to the political upheavals of the era, particularly 
          the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968, the Weather Underground, 
          and Huey Newton and the Black Panthers. I had wanted to be a revolutionary 
          back in high school, despite the fact I realized even then that the 
          pension plans for freedom fighters were somewhat less than ideal. I 
          decided to go to college to sort out my political leanings, among other 
          things. I waited two years before I entered college, as I went on a 
          two year &quot;self-discovery&quot; period. In time, I decided what 
          I wanted to do. Namely, I wanted to be a writer.</p>
        <p> The room had the vaguely sensual scent of jasmine enveloping it, and 
          I looked to see a stick of incense burning in an ashtray, sending up 
          plumes of fragrant smoke. There was a pleasantly mellow ambience in 
          the room. I noticed a fine-looking calico cat, and her name was &quot;Peckerwood&quot;, 
          based on my conversations with Beth, walking warily around the room, 
          eying me nervously. I'd always wondered why she had named her female 
          cat Peckerwood. </p>
        <p> &quot;Would you care for some fresh coffee, babe? I have some pretty 
          nice coffee from Sumatra I just brewed. Sumatra Mandheling. I just put 
          the beans in the grinder just a moment before you arrived,&quot; she 
          told me as I sat on her sofa. Coffee was another subject we shared in 
          common. We both purchased our favorite varieties and ground our beans 
          fresh, just before brewing. Our early &quot;coffee dates&quot;, where 
          we would sit and discuss books, current affairs, with her even indulging 
          me as I talked about baseball, provided a sturdy foundation for our 
          alliance. We simply enjoyed talking to one another. In fact, we seemed 
          to *fascinate* each other. I noticed she was looking at me in a manner 
          different from what she usually did. I wondered what the significance 
          of her assessment was.</p>
        <p> &quot;Yeah, I'd appreciate some coffee. Thank you. I can smell it. 
          It has a nice rich aroma to it. And it looks as if you have great taste 
          in art,&quot; I pointed out, alluding to the Dali prints adorning her 
          walls. When she returned with the hot coffee, she sat down rather close 
          to where I was sitting, and I slipped my arm around her shoulder, pulling 
          her even closer to me. She was wearing a small amount of subtle perfume, 
          and the effect was pleasing to me. It seemed to me that there was a 
          bit more of the usual sexual tension between us in the room, and that's 
          quite a statement, because Beth and I seemed to exude sort of a physical 
          affinity. As she extended her hand for her cup of coffee, she turned 
          to me and smiled brightly.</p>
        <p> &quot;Well, I don't know about art, but I know what I like,&quot; 
          she kidded, looking me in the eye as she said it, and I thought I saw 
          a flirtatious glance. &quot;Actually, those prints are Monica's, honey. 
          She brought them along with her from Oregon,&quot; she informed me, 
          referring to her strange roommate from Eugene. &quot;I'm having a few 
          problems writing this paper for the course 'History of American Foreign 
          Policy, 1945-to-Present'. I think I'm doing okay in the class as far 
          as tests go, but this paper is a significant portion of my grade. I 
          think I have a topic, but I'm having a little trouble with my thesis. 
          Didn't you take the class?&quot; she inquired as I reached for my coffee, 
          taking a sip of the hot caffeinated liquid.</p>
        <p> &quot;Yeah, I took it. I did pretty well in the course too, if I say 
          so myself... and I just did,&quot; I quipped with a smile. &quot;He's 
          a great professor. He got his doctorate at UC Berkeley. In fact, he's 
          why I took the course. I've taken several of his classes. Are there 
          still a lot of ROTC recruits in the class?&quot; I asked her, and seeing 
          her nod, continued after taking a quick sip of my coffee. &quot;I believe 
          I wrote mine on the withdrawal of the French after Dien Bien Phu, and 
          the resulting political mayhem occurring in the years following the 
          attack, leading to our increased involvement. I mean, at that time, 
          in 1954, we only had a few quote/unquote 'policy advisors' over there,&quot; 
          I explained to her.</p>
        <p> &quot;Yeah, the Domino Theory and all that,&quot; she remarked in 
          a manner bordering on sarcasm. She deliberately turned to me and grinned. 
          &quot;But he is a good professor. I really like him. I do have to take 
          a boatload of notes when I'm in his classes though. I was thinking of 
          doing my paper on the issues surrounding the Tet Offensive. It was one 
          of the turning points in the Vietnam War, wouldn't you think?&quot; 
          she asked me as she pulled a small vial from her jeans.</p>
        <p> &quot;Well, it was certainly a turning point in the American perception 
          of the war,&quot; I said to her while trying to eye the vial with my 
          peripheral vision. &quot;And Johnson decided not to run a mere two months 
          later. Good ol' LBJ. 1968 was a pivotal year in American history as 
          far as I'm concerned, and I think the '68 Convention had more than a 
          little to do with it,&quot; I stated, and as my curiosity got the best 
          of me, I asked, &quot;Umm, what's in the vial?&quot; </p>
        <p> &quot;Oh, this?&quot; she asked me with an innocent look on her face, 
          then mischievously grinned at me as she slowly shook the small vial 
          back and forth. &quot;Well, I guess I should tell you that it happens 
          to be some prime Hawaiian marijuana... Kona bud, to be specific. A good 
          friend of mine brought it back from the islands,&quot; she informed 
          me with a slight smile on her face, then continued. &quot;I haven't 
          smoked any of it yet. I was planning for this to be sort of a 'special' 
          night, so I was wondering if you were interested in partaking with me,&quot; 
          she grinned, putting her hand lightly on my thigh as she did so.</p>
        <p> &quot;Really? I really didn't think you got loaded,&quot; I told her, 
          looking at her incredulously while considering the many meanings of 
          'special', and loving the feel of her hand on my thigh. I had given 
          some thought to the possibility of Beth getting high, especially with 
          her fondness for all things &quot;hippie&quot;, but had purged the thought 
          from my head when did so well in her classes. &quot;Wow. I haven't 'partaken', 
          as you say, in a couple of years. Hmmm... what to do?&quot; I looked 
          over at her lovely face, breaking into a grin. &quot;But with you? Sure, 
          let's burn one. I'd be honored to get stoned with you. And you'll be 
          here to take care of me, right?&quot; I asked her with a smile.</p>
        <p> &quot;Sure, I'll take care of you, babe,&quot; she said with a seductive 
          smile, and after pausing to kiss me with more than a little passion, 
          went on. &quot;Actually, I haven't smoked any reefer since I was a senior 
          in high school, but I thought it would be rather fun to share what could 
          be a rather intimate experience together,&quot; she commented with a 
          sly smile, looking at me intently, and I didn't miss her reference to 
          'a rather intimate experience'. &quot;So, do you think you could manage 
          to roll us a joint, babe? And before you say anything about it being 
          wasteful, I just thought a joint would more properly 'set the mood', 
          as it were,&quot; she added while smiling widely, got up to go toward 
          the kitchen, then sat a couple of beers on the table.</p>
        <p> &quot;I think I can manage, babe,&quot; I smiled and told her as I 
          wondered just what she may have been 'setting the mood' for. &quot;You 
          may not have known this, but I'd been a joint man back when I got high. 
          Let's see the vial and the papers, sweetie,&quot; I smiled, and after 
          she gave them to me, I took a drink of my beer and began to prepare 
          the smoke so I could roll a bone, as it consisted of some rather compressed 
          sticky sinsemilla buds. </p>
        <p> &quot;You look like you know what you're doing when it comes to rolling 
          joints, Danny. If you don't mind me asking, why'd you stop smoking dope?&quot; 
          she inquired. &quot;Did you get busted or something?&quot; she asked 
          me, then took a small sip of her beer. </p>
        <p> &quot;Why, thank you, darlin'. Thank you very much,&quot; I told her 
          with a smile, taking a drink of my own beer. I had always been sort 
          of proud of my ability to roll a competent bone. I observed her grinning. 
          &quot;Actually, no, I didn't get popped, although I came awfully close 
          to it a time or two. Ask me about it sometime,&quot; I advised her. 
        </p>
        <p> &quot;I think this will be pretty neat, you and I getting loaded together,&quot; 
          Beth commented, looking me directly in the eyes, leaning in and adding 
          in a stealthy whisper, &quot;and I get somewhat horny after smoking 
          dope, you know.&quot; She tittered nervously as she did, before kissing 
          me with a tender passion on the lips.</p>
        <p> &quot;What a coincidence! From what I can remember, I get reasonably 
          randy after I get high as well,&quot; I told her with a wide grin on 
          my face as I finished rolling the joint. &quot;Maybe we'll be able to 
          work something out between us,&quot; I laughed as I handed her the bone. 
          I was becoming very interested in where this little dialogue might be 
          heading.</p>
        <p> &quot;Perhaps we shall,&quot; she said with a sly grin. &quot;Why, 
          thank you so very much, kind sir!&quot; she commented with a mock British 
          upper-crust accent added to her voice, and I held a match for her to 
          light the joint. &quot;Whoa! This tastes like some prime reefer here,&quot; 
          she commented after holding in a long slow draw on the joint, and passing 
          it to me. </p>
        <p> &quot;You're right. This does taste like some very good smoke,&quot; 
          I told her after taking a healthy toke from the joint and handing it 
          back to her. It had been quite a while since I had smelled the odor 
          of marijuana so close to me, and the sensation brought back many fond 
          memories. &quot;Umm, how are you feeling, babe?&quot; I asked her while 
          running my fingers through her sweet-scented hair, curious as to how 
          the smoke was affecting her.</p>
        <p> &quot;You might not believe this, honey, but I'm getting there already,&quot; 
          she told me with a silly grin on her face after she had held in her 
          hit and passed it to me. Although on Beth's face, it really didn't look 
          &quot;silly&quot;. It somehow looked sexy. In hindsight, I think I might 
          have been trying to imagine what her breasts looked like. Without the 
          shirt in the way. We continued passing the bone back and forth and as 
          it got progressively smaller, I took a few drinks of my beer. </p>
        <p> &quot;It's getting pretty small,&quot; I pointed out to her, and proceeded 
          to take a lengthy hit of the joint. I was quite pleasantly stoned, and 
          was enjoying myself immensely. I continued to undress her with my eyes.</p>
        <p> &quot;Yeah... that's what *she* said,&quot; she quipped with a devilish 
          grin. As I passed the joint back to her, I noticed her eyes were beginning 
          to redden. &quot;I think this thing is spent, babe,&quot; she declared, 
          and set it down in the ash tray. She stared at her Beck's for several 
          long moments, transfixed by the geometric patterns forming by the condensation 
          on the bottle, then asked &quot;Where is Bremen, honey?&quot; </p>
        <p> &quot;It's in northern Germany. Somewhat close to Hamburg, a port 
          city on the North Sea,&quot; I informed her casually. </p>
        <p> &quot;You don't mind, do you, babe? I'm feeling kinda drowsy,&quot; 
          she looked up and asked me, smiling innocently, and she wrapped her 
          dainty hand around my back as she lay her head on my lap. I looked down 
          at the sight of her slender body laying on its side, with her jeans 
          highlighting the enticing curves of her firm ass. </p>
        <p> &quot;Umm, I hope you realize that I might 'rise to the occasion', 
          if you catch my drift,&quot; I informed her with a wide grin, alluding 
          to the likely consequences of my cock being so close in proximity to 
          her face, not to mention her mouth. </p>
        <p> &quot;I hope you realize that it's not as if I was exactly oblivious 
          to your rather painfully obvious erections,&quot; she told me with a 
          chuckle. &quot;Sheesh! Did you possibly think I was under the impression 
          that you had a crescent wrench in your pocket pressing into my belly?! 
          I *knew* you were glad to see me,&quot; she told me, giggling as she 
          did, then continued as I observed her with a wide grin. <br>
          <br>
          &quot;And quite frankly, I was flattered. I think the world of you. 
          You've let me proceed in this alliance at my own speed. You've never 
          pressured me once to go any farther than I wanted to go. You've let 
          me define the parameters of this relationship, babe. You've respected 
          me in every way. In fact, despite my limited experience in such matters, 
          I'm pretty sure that I... well, there's other way to say this... I'm 
          pretty sure I love you, Danny,&quot; she said, looking me directly in 
          the eyes, and I felt an instantaneous tightening in my chest. There 
          was an uncomfortable pause in the conversation while we both considered 
          what she had just said. At this point, I think I would be best depicted 
          as &quot;pleasantly dazed&quot;. In retrospect, I must have suspected 
          it; but to hear her actually *say* it was quite a different story. Quite 
          a different story indeed. </p>
        <p> &quot;Yes, I'm quite sure of it. I'm in love with you,&quot; she said 
          rather unexpectedly, looking up into my face for a response. I wasn't 
          really certain of what, if any, emotions were showing. &quot;I hope 
          you aren't alarmed, but you're intelligent, you're really funny, you're 
          kind, you're informed, you tend to be gentle, and, last but not least, 
          you're pretty good looking,&quot; she finished with a radiant smile 
          as she moved her head upwards to kiss me sensuously on the lips, and 
          by looking into her eyes I could sense she had meant every word she 
          said. I was quite exhilarated.</p>
        <p> &quot;But it *was* a crescent wrench, babe... how did you know?&quot; 
          I joked, stalling for time as I wondered what I'd say to her after her 
          stunning revelation. &quot;And I *was* glad to see you. Very glad. And 
          I think the world of you as well, honey. You're very intelligent, you're 
          loving, you're kind, you're polite, and, you may think I'm going out 
          on a limb here, but you're quite beautiful to me. You really are,&quot; 
          I told her, looking to see her blushing slightly as I spoke. </p>
        <p> &quot;And although I have only one or two past experiences to compare 
          it with, you can rest assured that I love you as well, girlfriend,&quot; 
          I told her sincerely, pulling her up to me and we engaged in an ardent 
          kiss, sharing our tongues, our lips, our passion. I lazily stroked her 
          hair as she reposed her body to the couch, laying her head on my lap, 
          &quot;I do love you, Beth,&quot; I assured her, and looked down to see 
          her beaming radiantly, &quot;and I'm in love with you as well,&quot; 
          I concluded frankly. There. I said it. It seemed as if a tremendous 
          weight was lifted off of my shoulders. On the other hand, I could just 
          eliminate all of the melodrama and just say it felt good. And it did. 
          It felt good.</p>
        <p> &quot;You know, I think the two of us had sensed we both loved each 
          other, but both of us knew of the impending repercussions. On one hand, 
          you are looking forward to law school at the U of A, while on the other 
          hand, I'm planning to get my masters degree at UC Berkeley,&quot; she 
          told me, reaching up to gently caress my hair. . </p>
        <p> &quot;Yeah, I know, Beth, and I've given it some thought as well. 
          Who's to say that you couldn't get a job here?&quot; I posed the question 
          to her, thinking my logic was sound. I hoped. I was pretty ripped myself. 
          &quot;And who's to say I couldn't come out there,&quot; I blurted out 
          before I had really known what I was saying. </p>
        <p> &quot;That's definitely possible, but do you know what? We have a 
          couple of years or so until we cross that bridge,&quot; she pointed 
          out, looking me in the eyes as she went on. &quot;I suggest we stop 
          worrying so much about the future, and simply enjoy each other now. 
          Enjoy the moment, as the maxim goes. Do you have any objections to that?&quot; 
          she said to me while grinning nervously. &quot;Man, I'm higher than 
          a jaybird!&quot; she exclaimed joyfully with a wide grin on her face, 
          then abruptly stood up and grabbed my hand. &quot;Come on... I have 
          an idea,&quot; she instructed me with a soft smile rather mysteriously, 
          and after she took my hand in hers, I followed her wordlessly as she 
          led me down a hallway to the door of what I assumed to be her room. 
        </p>
        <p> &quot;C'mon in... lover,&quot; she said rather huskily, tittering 
          nervously as she opened the door to her room. Her matter-of-fact use 
          of the term 'lover' thrilled me. The room definitely had a counterculture 
          feel to it, with Peter Max and Grateful Dead posters tacked to the walls. 
          There was a Jimi Hendrix poster hanging on the wall as well, and she 
          even had one of those 'Desiderata' posters up. The room held a faint 
          trace of strawberry incense, as if it had been recently burned there, 
          and it had quite a pleasing effect overall. </p>
        <p> A small flickering candle on her dresser provided the only light in 
          her room, with the end result being that the room had an almost eerie 
          glow to it. I noticed a futon in one corner of the room, and she nudged 
          me toward it. &quot;Sit down, sweetie. Make yourself at home. Do you 
          like my room?&quot; she asked softly as she sat down on the edge of 
          the futon. As I watched, she lit a stick of incense, which I was presuming 
          to be strawberry. </p>
        <p> &quot;What's not to like? It's definitely you, babe,&quot; I told 
          her. &quot;And do you mean by 'make yourself at home' that I can take 
          off my shoes and socks and throw them randomly around the room?&quot; 
          I kidded her, and seeing her engagingly smile, joined her by slowly 
          easing myself to the thin mattress beside her. As I reached the soft 
          bedding, she pulled me close and kissed me warmly, wrapping her arms 
          around me gently and easing to the bed, pulling me on top of her. </p>
        <p> &quot;Help me take off my top,&quot; she whispered breathlessly while 
          looking lovingly into my eyes, and I was quite pleased at the direction 
          this thing appeared to be heading. I reached down and loosely grasped 
          the bottom hem of her shirt, pulling it over her head as she held her 
          arms out, and cast it aside. </p>
        <p> As I expected, her breasts were superb. They weren't large ponderous 
          breasts, which I consider rather cumbersome, but her breasts seemed 
          so... elegant, for lack of a better term. Conical is the word I find 
          coming to mind when I try to attach a descriptive term, but it isn't 
          quite accurate. Perhaps 'economical' would be more apt, as in 'more 
          than a handful is a waste', and they seemed to defy gravity. Her breasts 
          projected out inconspicuously from her chest with small dime-sized areolas, 
          with nice prominent nipples jutting proudly upward, and her creamy mounds 
          of flesh contrasted sharply with her deeply tanned body. </p>
        <p> I quickly removed my own shirt, leaning into her to kiss her tender 
          well-formed lips as she pulled me tightly to her body. Her perky nipples 
          pressed into my chest, and our breathing quickened considerably. I kissed 
          Beth passionately, sliding my tongue between her slightly parted lips, 
          our tongues intermingling excitedly in our mouths, and maintaining eye 
          contact as we did, expressing the desire within our eyes. </p>
        <p> I moved the kiss from her soft lips, lazily meandering across her 
          face to her lithe neck, lightly sucking and kissing the smooth skin 
          I found there, and she began to ease her fingers through my hair as 
          I hesitantly continued to her delicate breasts. I kissed all over her 
          small firm breasts, licking and gently nibbling her erect nipples, with 
          her dainty fingers pulling more urgently at my hair, and her murmuring 
          almost inaudibly. Her legs had subtly separated on the futon, and I 
          found myself between them as I kissed, nibbled, and licked across her 
          flat belly, teasing her navel with a tapered tongue. I looked up into 
          her captivating eyes, and she was looking toward me with a serene smile 
          on her face. </p>
        <p><br>
          As we exchanged loving gazes, I brought my hands to the top of her jeans, 
          and I worked the button free and her zipper down. I positioned my grip 
          to the sides of her pants, and with concurrent nods of our heads, she 
          lifted her hips slightly off of the futon, and I took my time leisurely 
          removing her pants, drinking in the enchanting view. In the dim light, 
          her panty-clad body appeared lovely, and I was quite sure it would have 
          held up in the full light of day. </p>
        <p> Her panties hugged tightly to her hips, and despite the reduced light, 
          the wet spot on her underwear was evident. I found myself aware of the 
          sensual aroma arising from her womanly charms, and it was a seductive 
          essence. I started to undo the button on my jeans in the first act of 
          shedding them, but then her hand rested on mine. Beth looked at me and 
          made a simple request. &quot;Don't,&quot; she said. &quot;Let me.&quot;</p>
        <p> She stood up abruptly, and gently pushed me onto my back, looking 
          at me with a sexy smile as she worked to undo the button on my jeans. 
          When the button was free, she slowly pulled down my zipper, and moved 
          her hands to the belt loops on the side of my pants. I looked at her 
          and smiled, lifting my hips, and she inched them down, then removed 
          them from my legs. She immediately stared wide-eyed at my rising swollen 
          shaft, unrestrained by the constraints of boxers or jockeys. It seemed 
          as if she wanted to say something, hesitated a few moments, and then 
          decided against it. </p>
        <p> Instead, she tentatively moved her hand toward my stiff rod, and she 
          then wrapped her fingers lightly around it. I was watching her dainty 
          hand, and from where I was lying, it seemed as if Beth was acclimating 
          herself to the texture of my hardness. She gazed over into my face, 
          wearing only a soft smile, and with her soft hand initiating a gentle 
          motion up and down the throbbing length of my cock. The sensations I 
          was experiencing from her hands' introduction to my pulsing shaft were 
          varied. They were sensuous and thrilling, there were elements of passion 
          and desire. </p>
        <p> All of her tender stroking had caused a somewhat large drop of pre-cum 
          to accumulate on the swollen head, and she stopped what she was doing, 
          bringing her finger to the swollen head of my hard prick. Beth lazily 
          smeared the slit on my cockhead, gathering up my pre-cum, and she looked 
          at me with uncertainty in her eyes, bringing her finger to her pursed 
          lips. In one smooth motion, she tasted my juices, then slid her finger 
          seductively into her mouth. As she pulled a clean finger from her mouth, 
          she locked onto my eyes, and casually shrugged one shoulder and tilted 
          her head, as if to say, 'What was all the fuss about?' </p>
        <p> I noticed a slight sheen of perspiration on Beth's forehead and upper 
          breasts, and her pert breasts glistened in the soft light. I took in 
          the enticing view of her standing in front of me, and I reached out 
          my hands to her panties, hooking my thumbs in her scant covering and 
          easing it slowly down her slender legs. She was standing in front of 
          me naked, and as I appreciated her nude form, I thought I could scarcely 
          make out a crease between her legs before she quickly eased into bed 
          beside me.</p>
        <p> We lay side by side, looking into each other's faces, and Beth leaned 
          in to kiss me, taking my face in her hands as she delivered her tongue 
          between my welcoming lips. I situated my hand on her slightly rounded 
          hip, feeling her perky breasts resting against my chest, and sucking 
          softly on her tongue as it danced wildly in my mouth. My hand eventually 
          wandered to the junction of her thighs, where the narrow spread of her 
          legs was gradually widening, and she commenced to kissing and lightly 
          sucking upon my neck. I moved my fingers slowly to her finely-haired 
          pubic mound. </p>
        <p> She was still sucking on my neck with inspired fervor as I lazily 
          ran my finger along the glistening lips of her dewy slit, and I knew 
          then I had to taste her. I gently dipped a finger into her tight quim, 
          and she stopped sucking on my neck to gasp softly. Looking into her 
          exuberant face, I brought my finger to my lips, tasting her piquant 
          juices, and she paid deliberate attention to me licking her juices with 
          enthusiasm. I returned my hand to where her legs met her body, and slowly 
          ran my finger up along the length of her puffy lips, avoiding her erect 
          clit purposely. </p>
        <p> One finger was inserted into her wet grasping pussy, then two fingers, 
          and I started a slow rhythm within her. She pulled my face down to her 
          lips and kissed me with smoldering need, darting her tongue in and out 
          of my mouth. Taking her face in my hand while softly stroking her hair, 
          I kissed her in a manner skirting on bawdy. I repeatedly thrust my tongue 
          into her mouth, only to be lustily greeted by hers, and gradually eased 
          my face away. Kissing and licking my way to her pert breasts, I focused 
          on one of her perky nipples, then the other, and bathed them lovingly 
          with a flattened tongue, softly sucking upon them. Conceiving of an 
          unbusied approach to sucking and nibbling across her flat stomach, I 
          carried it out, and brought one hand to caress her taut breasts, while 
          the other moved lazily towards her dewy slit. </p>
        <p> As I reached her hollowed navel, I searched it with the tip of my 
          tongue as my hand meandered to her sparse pubic mound, and I brought 
          two fingers upwards along her very wet pussy. I slowly moved my fingers 
          within her pouty lips, feeling how wet she had become, and I kissed 
          and nibbled toward her wispy-thin triangle. Feeling her hands on my 
          head, delicately urging me downward to the source of her fragrant essence, 
          I gladly accepted her hint, moving my head between her widespread legs. 
          I appreciatively took in the sight of her soaked pussy, and as I inhaled 
          her fragrant bouquet, I noted the widespread lips of her labia, gleaming 
          in the paltry light of the flickering candle. I moved to kiss her inner 
          thighs, both of them, kissing and licking all the way to where her legs 
          met her torso, but not yet touching her dripping center. </p>
        <p> I felt her hands return to the back of my head, softly gripping my 
          hair, and I flattened my tongue and drew it vertically along the length 
          of her swollen lips, delighting in the taste of her savory juices. I 
          perceived a soft moan coming from Beth's lips, and after running my 
          tongue along her swollen lips, I searched out her tight hole. Gently 
          sucking on her distended lips, drawing her tender flesh in my mouth, 
          and upon releasing it, I eased my tongue into her. At the same time, 
          I gently insinuated my hands beneath her splendid ass, revelling in 
          the feel of her firm flesh. I heard her moan again, a bit louder this 
          time, and the hands on the back of my head applied a faint pressure 
          as I pushed my tongue impetuously into her juicy cunt. </p>
        <p> Easing my tongue in and out of her dewy slit, a moderate rhythm developed 
          itself, and as I peeked up at Beth from between her raised thighs, I 
          saw her eyes closed tightly, with an almost inappreciable smile crossing 
          her face. I luxuriated in her abundant juices as I ran my tongue along 
          the length of her once more, this time stopping when I reached her proud 
          nub, and took a few playful stabs at her core with my tongue. I bathed 
          it lightly with my tongue several times, and this time when I glanced 
          at her, her head was moving back and forth, eyes still tightly closed, 
          but this time what would have to be described as a tight-lipped grin 
          was affixed on her face. I tenderly surrounded her swollen clit with 
          my lips, and applied a very light suction to it, and her hands pulled 
          my face tightly toward her. Sucking harder, I heard a very low-toned 
          stream of incoherent language being emitted from her lips, as her hips 
          begin to raise up toward my face, with almost imperceptible jerks of 
          her soaked pussy toward my welcoming mouth. </p>
        <p> Taking a few playful swipes of my tongue at her feisty clit, I then 
          ran my tongue up the length of her juicy cunt. Wrapping my lips around 
          her bulging clitoris, she emitted a sound resembling sort of a high-pitched 
          mewling, tightening her thighs closely around my head, tight enough 
          to become worrisome, until she finally went limp on the futon, breathing 
          heavily. I made a trail of kisses across her stomach and her breasts, 
          then quickly shifted my weight and positioned myself by her side. I 
          slid my arm underneath her lithe neck, and looked at her attractive 
          face for several minutes as she recovered from her consummation. She 
          turned to me and smiled unrestrainedly.</p>
        <p> &quot;Wow! No one has ever done that for me before, Danny... ever!&quot; 
          she gushed, her lovely face radiantly beaming, then kissed me impetuously 
          while wrapping her arms around me, slipping her tongue inside my mouth 
          to meet mine. &quot;Thank you, and I mean it,&quot; she said, and then 
          paused with a look of bemused surprise on her face. &quot;Hmm... so 
          that's what I taste like, eh?&quot; she inquired and grinned broadly.</p>
        <p> &quot;That's you, babe, Do you like it? I know I do,&quot; I told 
          her and smiled, and saw her blush slightly. &quot;And don't mention 
          it. I'm really quite surprised I am the first to taste you. I really 
          am. In fact, I'm honored. I can tell you honestly that I've wanted to 
          taste your pu...,&quot; I started to say, then corrected myself, &quot;I 
          mean, umm... taste your 'kitty', yeah, that's what I'll call it, from 
          about the first day I met you,&quot; I informed her with more than a 
          fair amount of honesty, and kissed her softly on the lips.</p>
        <p> &quot;You can say 'pussy' in front of me, Danny! And if I must remind 
          you, a few moments ago you had your tongue in mine,&quot; she pointed 
          out to me and giggled . &quot;Girls use it pretty commonly these days,&quot; 
          she informed me with a shy titter. &quot;I mean, I try not to say it 
          too often, but girls generally don't say 'he put his pee-pee in my vagina'. 
          'Pee-pee' is way too schoolyard, while 'vagina' is far too clinical, 
          although I'm pretty sure 'vagina' is from the Latin for sheath, which 
          I think is a fairly apt description,&quot; Beth informed me, then asked, 
          &quot;From the first day you met me, huh? Color me flattered. So why 
          didn't you say anything? And where did you come up with that 'kitty' 
          thing?&quot; </p>
        <p> &quot;'Why didn't I say anything?&quot; I repeated her words for effect, 
          and explained, &quot;I think that's in Chapter 2 of the book _How to 
          Get a Woman to Instantly Despise You_ 'Excuse me, ma'am, but may I eat 
          your pussy?' Doesn't usually work, unless you happen to be in the Red 
          Light district and have a few hundred dollars in your pocket,&quot; 
          I explained to her with a grin. </p>
        <p> &quot;And I'd still like to hear the origin of 'kitty'. I have a feeling 
          I'll be rapt,&quot; she said with a sly grin.<br>
          <br>
          &quot;Oh, the 'kitty' thing,&quot; I said, looking over at Beth's elegant 
          features, &quot;an old girlfriend of mine used it to describe her 'intimates', 
          shall we say. And to be perfectly frank with you, hearing you say 'pussy' 
          somewhat excites me,&quot; I explained honestly.</p>
        <p> &quot;It shows, honey,&quot; she grinned, &quot;and what shall we 
          call this?&quot; she inquired snickering, pointing at the throbbing 
          cock jutting from my body. &quot;Hmmm... let's see, 'pee-pee' doesn't 
          seem to do it justice, and 'dick' is a tad schoolyard, I think... so 
          in this situation, I think we should call it a 'cock' by default,&quot; 
          she declared with a calm smile, showing her expertise in the field of 
          street semantics. &quot;But in your case, maybe we should call it your 
          'big, hard, pulsing cock',&quot; she said playfully, grinning at me 
          sweetly. </p>
        <p> &quot;So, Danny... shall we proceed to the next step, darlin'? I believe 
          I want you inside of me,&quot; she told me smiling, knowing she was 
          driving me to my limits. &quot;To be precise, I want *this* thing,&quot; 
          she said while wrapping her dainty hand around my hard shaft, &quot;your 
          'big, hard, pulsing cock' inside of me,&quot; Beth purred softly, a 
          bit beyond mere suggestiveness, shocking me with her candor.</p>
        <p> It took several moments for me to digest all of the information Beth 
          had dispersed in the last several minutes, but knowing of Beth's unending 
          enjoyment from shocking me, I tried to collect myself, and observed, 
          &quot;Beth, believe me, I want to 'get in your pants', to use a subtle 
          euphemism. And I also would like to get my 'big, hard, pulsing cock', 
          your term, inside of you... you can be sure of that... but what about 
          birth control? The last thing we need is a child. Well, maybe not exactly 
          the last thing; the last thing might be if we were fused together at 
          the hips. But you get my point... and I don't carry a rubber in my wallet. 
          Never have.&quot;</p>
        <p> &quot;It's a moot point, Danny. I'm on the Pill,&quot; she said, surprising 
          me again. &quot;And call me naive, but I don't see you as an intravenous 
          drug user, and we already discussed the homo thing... excuse me, that's 
          'gay' thing, Mr. Politically Correct, and I don't think you're either 
          one of them. Call me a novice, or call me in love, or you can call me 
          both, but I don't want you wearing anything. Why?&quot; she asked rhetorically, 
          and before I could respond, &quot;You don't have to wear anything because 
          I love you, Danny. And loving you includes trusting you not to do anything 
          to hurt me. And I do trust you,&quot; she asserted. &quot;But for one 
          who delivered such an eloquent discourse on the discomfort of using 
          condoms, I'm quite touched by the fact you were considering purchasing 
          one to use for our 'sexual congress', your term,&quot; she said, and 
          I didn't detect any sarcasm in her voice, which was something in itself. 
          &quot;No wonder I love you, Danny,&quot; she said, and somewhat out 
          of character, she didn't smile. </p>
        <p> &quot;Are you sure, Beth? This could change our relationship drastically, 
          you know,&quot; I told her, secretly hoping she wouldn't change her 
          mind. &quot;I want to do this as much as you do, honey... damn, I want 
          to do this... but I don't want to do anything to endanger our friendship,&quot; 
          I said, and looked to see her silently nodding, looking at me intently. 
          &quot;We both know what sexual relationships can do to friendships. 
          It can make bitter enemies of former good friends. It would kill me 
          to place our unique love affair in jeopardy,&quot; I told her, and proceeded 
          to put the ball in her court, saying, &quot;So this is what I'm going 
          to do... I'm leaving it up to you. If you think we can navigate our 
          intimate friendship through the treacherous tides of sexual intimacy, 
          then so be it. We'll do it,&quot; I said, looking over at her attractive 
          face, hoping she would easily refute my logic. I was counting on it.</p>
        <p> &quot;Okay, Danny,&quot; she said to me almost immediately, then paused 
          momentarily to consider her next words. &quot;Here's the way I see it 
          - 1) on one hand, we may ruin our relationship, which is doubtful, but 
          remains a possibility; on the other hand, we may *strengthen* our relationship. 
          Are we willing to risk it? I don't know about you, but I am. Baby, I 
          can see your point at being reluctant to risk our friendship, and I 
          appreciate your unselfishness to point those risks out, but Danny, please 
          consider this point... we don't *resemble* any other couple!&quot; Beth 
          said rather assertively, and I had to admit, she had a point. She continued. 
        </p>
        <p> &quot;And 2) I think this bond is plenty strong to withstand, and 
          I quote, 'the treacherous tides of sexual intimacy'(nice metaphor by 
          the way, babe),&quot; she opined parenthetically, and continued without 
          skipping a beat. &quot;Hell, I've known girls who have had five lovers 
          and more in the year and a half we've been, quote/unquote, 'acquainted', 
          if you will. And Danny... you haven't had any lovers. I'd know. The 
          school isn't that big. Granted, it's big, but not big enough for the 
          juicier bits of the girls' grapevine to elude me,&quot; she explained, 
          and again she had a point. </p>
        <p> &quot;People already think we're doing each other now, Danny,&quot; 
          she told me, and again, she had yet another point. Most of my friends, 
          both male and female, suspected our denials were an amateurish attempt 
          to be inconspicuous. If I were an outsider, I'd have likely thought 
          the same thing. I think we may have even had a sexual 'glow' about us. 
          Only without the sex. I believe I was convinced. </p>
        <p> I took her tightly into my arms, running my hands down her back to 
          gently cup the rounded globes of her firm ass, thrusting my tongue deeply 
          into her mouth. Easing her onto her back, she slowly spread her slender 
          legs, giving me a sultry smile. I gently wound my hands through her 
          long silken strands, kissing her very tenderly at the corners of her 
          sensuous lips. My hand meandered down to her downy pubic area, slowly 
          approaching to her excited swollen pussy. </p>
        <p> As my fingers grazed her wet labia, I kissed her soft lips passionately, 
          our tongues madly dancing within our mouths. I kissed my way to her 
          lean neck, gently kissing and licking my way to her shoulder, and then 
          continuing down to her milky-white breasts. Her erect nipple found its 
          way to my mouth, and I ran my tongue softly against her perky flesh, 
          trailing to her other nipple. Her fingers entwined in my hair as I slowly 
          descended down her flattened tummy, kissing and nibbling my way to the 
          beginning of her sparse pubic triangle. </p>
        <p> Reaching the junction of her thighs, she spread her legs widely, bending 
          them at the knee. I moved to kiss and suck on her inner thighs, and 
          her hands were in my hair as I kissed ever so closer to her saturated 
          flower. The center of her flowing slit attracted my kisses, and I drew 
          her distended lips into my mouth, tasting her tart juices. I moved down 
          to the beginning of her sultry womanhood, and I flattened my tongue, 
          slowly bringing it up the length of her soaked pussy, and stopping when 
          I arrived at her upright clit. Lightly swiping my tongue across her 
          sensitive nub, and her hands on my head pulled me tightly against her 
          body. </p>
        <p> Looking up at her face, she silently mouthed the words 'I want you 
          now', and I kissed and licked my way across her flat belly. I arrived 
          at her elegant breasts, kissing and licking on one, then the other, 
          and finally reached her radiant face. Very softly at first, I kissed 
          her, then with increasing passion as I eased my tongue into her mouth. 
          She met mine with enthusiasm, our tongues wrestling within each other's 
          mouths, and I positioned the bulging head at the entrance to her soaked 
          excitement. Tempted to thrust my stiff prick deeply inside of her, I 
          instead rubbed the swollen head all along the source of her moisture, 
          gathering up her lubrication for my initial entry. </p>
        <p> Looking deeply into her mesmerizing eyes I applied firm, yet gentle 
          pressure into her, I slid inside of her, and I was in awe of the amazing 
          tightness of her sweet cunt. There was a look of muted elation on the 
          face of the woman I loved, and I initiated a slow easy rhythm within 
          her, feeling her arms around my back, pulling me close. As I began to 
          thrust harder and deeper into her lubricated quim, I took her perky 
          nipples into my mouth, at first one, then the other, tenderly bathing 
          them with my tongue. Her tight wet pussy was the target of my pistoning 
          hard cock, and as my swollen balls slapped lightly against her superb 
          derriere, she positioned her hands on my ass, pulling me even deeper 
          within her. I moved my face to the side of her neck, sucking and licking 
          on her smooth skin there, and she whispered provocatively in my ear, 
          &quot;Yes, Danny! Fuck me! Oh baby! Fuck me hard!&quot; lost in the 
          throes of passion. </p>
        <p> When I heard her enthusiastic pleas, I pounded her drenched pussy 
          mercilessly, and she met my every thrust with a very alluring expression 
          on her attractive face. Continuing to hammer into her tight slit, Beth 
          pulled me down to her to kiss me with heartfelt emotion, and I could 
          sense that familiar feeling in the back of my swollen balls. She was 
          moving her head from side to side, her eyes tightly closed, and I continued 
          to drive my shaft deeply into her. </p>
        <p> Suddenly, she wrapped her legs around the back of my thighs, and as 
          I drove into her deeply, she began to utter a subdued stream of rousing 
          off-color language into my ear. Releasing a deluge of warm pearly white 
          cum into her womb, I could feel her vaginal walls contracting around 
          me, and I moved my lips to hers, kissing her with love and affection. 
          Backing my face away until I was inches from her pretty face, I gazed 
          into her pretty blue-gray eyes, and she smiled lovingly at me. We rested 
          in silence for several minutes before Beth spoke.</p>
        <p> &quot;Danny... I *loved* that. We were loving, we were intimate, we 
          were passionate... we didn't just fuck... we *made love*,&quot; she 
          said dreamily.</p>
        <p> &quot;I'm glad you enjoyed it, girlfriend. I very much enjoyed it 
          myself,&quot; I told her without pretense, &quot;And fucking comes later... 
          we'll work up to that,&quot; I told her with a wide grin.</p>
        <p> &quot;That's not funny!,&quot; she said as she punched my arm semi-sharply. 
          &quot;We just shared an amazing intimate experience,&quot; she said 
          with conviction, &quot;or don't you see it that way?&quot; she asked 
          somewhat suspiciously.</p>
        <p> &quot;I'm sorry. I was just being a wise-ass. You're right, baby. 
          It *was* special. It *was* intimate. It *was* passionate,&quot; I told 
          her as I attempted to repair her hurt feelings. </p>
        <p> &quot;Really?&quot; she asked, looking to see me nodding with a smile 
          on my face. &quot;You know, I was worried about that somewhat, given 
          all of your sexual experience.&quot;</p>
        <p> &quot;Beth, I'm *not* all that sexually experienced. I stayed with 
          my first girlfriend for five years.,&quot; I said. </p>
        <p> &quot;I believe you, Danny. I appreciate your honesty when dealing 
          with your sordid past,&quot; she said grinning, looking at me with affection. 
          &quot;And just to clear this little issue with no misunderstandings, 
          when I said 'no one has ever done this for me before', or something 
          to that effect, I didn't only mean 'oral sex', although now I know the 
          reason it's called 'giving head'. I meant no one had ever given me an 
          *orgasm*. You know, climax. Spasm. &#145;Riding the pony'. Discharge. 
          Getting off. The big 'O'. Cum. You're the first, Danny... other than 
          my own hand, that is,&quot; she said with an impertinent smile on her 
          face. &quot;But they were *nothing* like the rapture you bestowed upon 
          me a little while ago. Again, thank you. I love you, babe. And I'll 
          see if I can maybe make it up to you,&quot; she said with something 
          of an inviting grin of her face.</p>
        <p> &quot;Wow... what about all of your other boyfriends?&quot; I inquired 
          of her, sincerely wanting to know the answer, and feeling quite full 
          of myself with the knowledge that I had brought her initial orgasm. 
          Well, other than her own hand. &quot;And why are you on the Pill?&quot; 
          I asked her, almost as an afterthought.</p>
        <p> &quot;Haven't I already told you that I only had two 'real' boyfriends?&quot; 
          she reminded me, and I realized she had told me. &quot;And by 'real', 
          I meant that I 'did it' with them or 'went all the way'. 'Going all 
          the way' consisted of two lousy minutes, and that's giving them the 
          benefit of the doubt, of unfocused humping and heavy breathing. And 
          the Pill? Well, neither of my so-called lovers wore protection, and 
          I started thinking what a tragedy it would have been to have either 
          one of those sphincters' children. So I listened, I read a lot, and 
          then marched right up to the public clinic and obtained the pill. Just 
          in case. And then I met you. Like I said, you've let me advance at my 
          own pace -- and I love you for it. You see, I was a pretty protected 
          kid when I was growing up. An all-girl Catholic high school, not being 
          able to date until I was 16, a sexually-repressed mother and father 
          who didn't bother teaching me about the 'facts of life'. At all,&quot; 
          she said, sounding pretty exasperated. I put my arm around her shoulder, 
          thinking the all-girls school and not being able to date until she was 
          16 would go a long way in explaining why she only had two boyfriends. 
        </p>
        <p> &quot;You seemed to do more than okay a little while ago. How did...,&quot; 
          I began to say when Beth cut in.</p>
        <p> &quot;I listened a lot. You'd be surprised at how randy the things 
          that are said in the girls' locker room or bathroom. I've heard girls 
          bragging they screwed some trophy lay, like a professor or something. 
          I don't know if it was true, but I've heard certain professors had creative 
          ways of allowing you to earn 'extra credit', if you will,&quot; she 
          said with a displeased expression on her face. &quot;I read quite a 
          bit. And actually, I was just more or less following your lead. I trusted 
          you, and you proved worthy of that trust,&quot; she expressed, then 
          said, &quot;And best of all... you lasted more than two minutes,&quot; 
          laughing as she did, and kissing me sweetly when she was through.</p>
        <p> &quot;Yeah, I was good for at least three, and hell, I might even 
          have lasted *four* minutes,&quot; I kidded her, and looked to see her 
          giggling. &quot;Believe it not, I was a two-minute man myself in the 
          early stage of the game. I kinda think we all are,&quot; I told her 
          honestly.</p>
        <p> &quot;Umm... how old were you at this so-called 'early stage of the 
          game'?&quot; she inquired, looking at me with sincere interest.</p>
        <p> &quot;Now, I'm going to be honest with you here, so don't brand me 
          as promiscuous or anything,&quot; I bargained with her, and seeing her 
          nod her head, I said, &quot;Fourteen.&quot;</p>
        <p> &quot;Well, it's not like I've never heard of that before. Just out 
          of curiosity... how old was she? And while I'm at it, what was her name?&quot; 
          she asked, and I was quite surprised she had asked me those questions.</p>
        <p> &quot;You know what, Beth? I'll be damned if I even remember it. You 
          see, I was really drunk, you see, and...,&quot; I started to say when 
          I looked at her to see her rolling her eyes. &quot;No, I'll be honest... 
          she was a *mature* 12 or 13. And her name was Rae; pretty name, huh? 
          And I might point out, we stayed together for about five years, so I 
          haven't had a boatload of girlfriends either,&quot; I said, wondering 
          what reaction she would have.</p>
        <p> &quot;Rae, huh? You're right. It is a pretty name. It sounds to me 
          as if you were both rather 'precocious', shall we say. Did you love 
          her? And, did you, well, you know... do everything?&quot; she asked 
          me hesitantly.</p>
        <p> &quot;Yeah, I guess we were precocious in a sense,&quot; I told her. 
          &quot;She was my first. And yes, I loved her. And, I think we did everything 
          that a 'normal' heterosexual couple does, but I guess it depends on 
          how you define 'normal'.&quot;</p>
        <p> &quot;Woman on top, huh? Let's just say that I'm intrigued,&quot; 
          she said smiling, leering at me. &quot;Did she, umm, you know... umm, 
          orally satisfy you?&quot; Beth nervously struggled to ask me.</p>
        <p> &quot;Why, yes she did, Beth... why do you ask?&quot; I inquired, 
          curious as to where this line of questioning was leading.</p>
        <p> &quot;Well... I think I want to do it for you,&quot; she said, and 
          as she was saying the words I felt myself begin to stiffen. &quot;No, 
          I'm *sure* I want to do it for you. I mean, you did it for me and made 
          me feel so good... I'm pretty sure I want to return the favor... it's 
          only fair,&quot; she told me, and I felt a huge smile growing upon my 
          face.</p>
        <p> &quot;First of all, you would do it for *us*... not for me. And it's 
          not about 'fair', darlin'. I did what I did to you because I *wanted* 
          to. And I enjoyed it. Are you sure, honey? I mean...,&quot; I was about 
          to say when she cut in.</p>
        <p> &quot;I've been thinking about it since you made me cum so beautifully 
          tonight. I can't begin to describe the sensations I felt. It's the least 
          I can do... and better yet, I *want* to do this. I want to make you 
          feel as good as you made me feel. Simply put, I want to taste you, Danny,&quot; 
          she said with resolve, and as my erection rose up even more, she looked 
          at my face for a reaction.</p>
        <p> &quot;Okay, honey... if you're sure,&quot; I told her. &quot;I'm game,&quot; 
          I concluded, kissed her enthusiastically, and rolled over on my back. 
          The fact was, I was *way* more than merely game. I think I might have 
          been World Series in relation to 'game', if that's a reasonable analogy. 
          That is to say, 'considerably more than game'.</p>
        <p> With that, she climbed on top my body and lay on top of me. She kissed 
          me on the lips, hesitantly and with her lips closed as first, and then 
          she gradually became more aggressive with her sweet kisses. I ran my 
          hands softly over her exquisite rounded ass, feeling her hair reach 
          my hands, and she eased her tongue into my mouth, swirling her tongue 
          in unison with mine. Stroking her hair from the middle of her back to 
          where it ended at her splendid ass, she raised her head and looked directly 
          into my eyes. I saw hints of love. I saw suggestions of desire. I saw 
          fragments of pleasure. </p>
        <p> I looked to see her smile slightly, then she moved her soft lips to 
          the side of my neck, licking and sucking tenderly, and she slowly started 
          to descend down my body. She paused as she came to my erect nipples, 
          pausing to bathe each one with her tongue as she softly sucked upon 
          them, drawing a low moan from my lips. She looked up at me and smiled 
          when she heard me moan, then very deliberately and slowly kissed and 
          nibbled her way across my stomach, and I felt her firm breasts on the 
          top of my thighs. She very briefly inserted her tongue into my navel, 
          and then she very slowly kissed a path to the top of my pubic hair.</p>
        <p> &quot;Danny, I've never done this before,&quot; she told me in a nervous 
          whisper as she looked up at me expectantly. &quot;I want to do this 
          for you... for us, but I don't really know how to go about it. Will 
          you tell me what to do?&quot;</p>
        <p> &quot;This might surprise you, honey, but I've never done it in my 
          somewhat brief history either,&quot; I pointed out in a soft tone while 
          grinning at her, but when I noticed her begin to frown, I hurried to 
          quell her fears. &quot;Look Beth, first of all, I'm quite honored I'll 
          be your first. Secondly, I don't want you to do this if you're not sure. 
          And lastly, don't worry about it, baby. Just the fact that you have 
          your hand on my cock is thrilling enough to me. Just do what seems natural,&quot; 
          I reassured her while looking at her enchanting face, &quot;and I'm 
          sure you'll do just fine.&quot;</p>
        <p> Kissing in the area near the beginning of my pubic growth, continuing 
          downward until my straining cock gently poked her beneath her chin, 
          she pulled her head away slightly. She looked down at my swollen shaft, 
          and I noticed her very seductively, if not purposely, slowly licking 
          her lips, and she gently wrapped her fingers around my prick. Very slowly, 
          she lowered her head to my shaft, and I felt her hair flowing over my 
          thighs as she hesitantly kissed on the crown. </p>
        <p> Tentatively sticking her tongue out of her mouth, she lightly touched 
          the skin beneath the sensitive bulging head, and feeling me twitch, 
          she quickly moved to the base of my manhood. She slowly drew her tongue 
          up my swollen length, and when she reached the tip, she looked into 
          my eyes and smiled, taking the bulging head into her mouth. I felt her 
          tease the sensitive underside of my stiff cock with a lively tongue 
          as she took more of my prick into the sweet recesses of her mouth, and 
          I noticed as she slowly withdrew my hardness from her mouth her sensuous 
          lips had formed a perfect 'o'. </p>
        <p> Upon reaching the expanded head of my straining prick, she teased 
          the underside before plunging me into the back of her mouth, and the 
          effect was very arousing. She initiated a slow process, moving back 
          and forth on my swollen rod, and I gently insinuated my hands into her 
          hair, gently grasping her head to guide her. She continued these movements 
          for what seemed like five minutes, and the mere fact her pretty face 
          was sliding up and down my hard tool was bringing me close to eruption, 
          despite the fact we had just made love a little while ago. Occasionally, 
          she would look me directly in the eye, with love and an intimation of 
          a grin in her eyes, and she would apply even greater suction. I felt 
          a familiar sensation rising in my balls, and I thought it only fair 
          to warn her of my impending release.</p>
        <p> &quot;Baby,&quot; I grunted softly, &quot;I think I'm going to cum,&quot; 
          I warned her, pretty confident I was being truthful in my appraisal.</p>
        <p> &quot;Umm... isn't that the point?&quot; she said softly in a hushed 
          voice quite logically after she backed her lips off of my pulsing prick, 
          with a note of both confusion and slight irritation. Apparently she 
          wasn't familiar with the term 'spitter'.</p>
        <p> &quot;If you say so, lover,&quot; I told her, and I watched as she 
          attacked my swollen shaft with a renewed vigor. She began to move her 
          lips along my hard cock, all the while applying her tongue to the sensitive 
          undersurface, and she advanced until the head touched the back of her 
          mouth. She must have sensed I was close, as she began to bob her head 
          quickly up and down my pulsing rod, and just as she looked into my eyes 
          I unleashed my first torrent of cum inside her mouth. She registered 
          a look of surprise on her elegant face, but gathered herself and quickly 
          swallowed that spurt and the resulting shots immediately following. 
          She lovingly kissed and cleaned my softening shaft, and then slowly 
          kissed and nibbled her way up my body. </p>
        <p> &quot;Beth... I love you,&quot; I told her, and pulled her face close 
          to mine. </p>
        <p> &quot;Okay... I don't want to seem self-serving or anything, but I 
          have to know... how was I?&quot; she hesitantly said, with a look that 
          evoked sympathy.</p>
        <p> &quot;You were incredible. You were sensual, you were tantalizing, 
          you were sexy, you were...,&quot; I stopped in mid-sentence and looked 
          at her. She was positively glowing. &quot;Umm, ever read Bernard Malamud?&quot; 
          I asked her.</p>
        <p> &quot;Why, certainly. I read 'The Natural', I think when I was in 
          eleventh grade. Why do you ask?&quot; she asked, wondering what the 
          book reference was all about.</p>
        <p> &quot;That's the one... 'The Natural'... except you don't hit home 
          runs, you give pleasure with your mouth, not to mention other areas 
          of your body, although I just did,&quot; I grinned at her.</p>
        <p> &quot;Really? Good. Because to be honest with you, I rather enjoyed 
          it. I didn't really mind the taste, although it's probably not something 
          I'd put on an ice cream sundae. The feeling of power was neat. It really 
          was. If you don't mind, honey, I think I'll want to do this a lot more,&quot; 
          she told me, her blue-gray eyes sparkling at me as she did.</p>
        <p> &quot;Aww... no way!&quot; I pouted in mock anger, then said, &quot;You've 
          just made me a very happy man, baby,&quot; I told her gleefully. &quot;Perhaps 
          we ought to try and get some shut-eye, baby. It will be a special treat 
          to sleep in your arms, lover.&quot;</p>
        <p> &quot;I believe you're right, lover. Thank you for a wonderful night. 
          May there be many more. Good night, baby,&quot; she said, kissing me 
          softly, flicking her tongue in my mouth, before nestling her head on 
          my shoulder. &quot;I love you,&quot; she whispered into my ear.</p>
        <p> &quot;Thank *you*, baby... and I love you too,&quot; I said, kissing 
          her forehead, and we were sleeping in each other's arms fairly quickly 
          after our amorous night.<br>
          <br>
          After that eventful evening, we evolved into a rather passionate relationship, 
          as we both enjoyed the charms of each other's bodies, and we took steps 
          to indulge in those charms at every opportunity. We also continued to 
          smoke reefer a little more than occasionally, and enjoyed the sense 
          of intimacy the smoke seemed to provide. We parted on amiable terms 
          after we left school, as neither of us were quite ready for marriage. 
          She went home to San Diego, Mission Beach to be exact, and I stayed 
          in Tucson to attempt to try and write a few stories I had some ideas 
          for, getting them down on paper before entering law school.</p>
        <p> <br>
          The sweet fragrance of Beth's recently washed hair shook me out of my 
          reverie. She was simply gorgeous. I hadn't seen her for a number of 
          years, and although we talked only occasionally on the phone, we managed 
          to remain very close friends over the years, albeit platonic friends. 
          We still professed our love for one another, and I believe we were being 
          candid. I know I was. Which culminated in this exchange.</p>
        <p> &quot;Come on in. It's great to see you. Would you like some coffee? 
          I have some French Roast I've been saving for you,&quot; I remarked 
          while smiling broadly, shaken from my daydream, remembering she enjoyed 
          her coffee on the strong side. </p>
        <p> &quot;Thanks. I'd like that. Love the music, babe,&quot; she said 
          as she entered the door, and she put her arms around my neck and softly 
          kissed me. I found myself fondly recalling our impassioned past, how 
          we had kissed and caressed desirously whenever the opportunity presented 
          itself. We had listened to a bit of Steely Dan in college, and I was 
          pretty sure the music in the background summoned as many pleasant memories 
          for her as it did me. I remembered thinking how fitting making love 
          to her to the sounds of &quot;Countdown to Ecstasy&quot; was, and that 
          reflection brought to mind how sublime she had looked the first time 
          I witnessed her unclothed on her bed. Presently, she was looking at 
          me with an expression of ardent desire, and I put my arms around her 
          waist and pulled her close, gazing into her pretty blue-gray eyes, thankful 
          for my good fortune.</p>
        <p> &quot;Beth, if I may be so bold... what the fuck are you doing here?!&quot; 
          I inquired, smiling widely, wanting to know the reason for this fortuitous 
          visit. Then again, perhaps it wasn't so random. It wasn't like I was 
          going to ask her to leave if she didn't answer me correctly. I was just 
          curious to know how we happened to cross paths. </p>
        <p> &quot;Danny, it's Spring Break, as you may be aware, and I had some 
          time off from the classes I'm teaching, and I... and I've missed you,&quot; 
          she explained, and I thought I noticed what resembled tears suddenly 
          welling in her eyes as she spoke to me.</p>
        <p> &quot;Hey... please don't cry, baby,&quot; I appealed to her, taking 
          her tightly into my arms. &quot;We're together now, and I think we should 
          enjoy each other while we're in the same room. An astute philosopher 
          woman once said to me, and I quote, 'enjoy the moment',&quot; I whispered, 
          and saw her softly smiling through her tears. &quot;That's better. I 
          love to see your beautiful smile. And if you were wondering... I still 
          love you, honey,&quot; I told her truthfully, looking into her eyes.</p>
        <p> &quot;Ditto,&quot; she said with a wide smile. &quot;I've missed you, 
          baby. I've missed your laugh, I've missed your smile, I've missed your 
          eyes, and, most of all, I've missed your caress,&quot; she spoke with 
          a seductive tone.</p>
        <p> She followed me into the kitchen as I went to prepare the coffee, 
          and as I finished filling the carafe, I turned to see her looking into 
          my eyes amorously with a soft smile on her face. She seemed to have 
          an agenda to address. The stirring in my jeans continued, and I quickly 
          adjusted the bulge in my pants when she briefly looked away, examining 
          an Escher print on my wall. </p>
        <p> &quot;Umm, got something in mind?&quot; I asked her with a grin, reaching 
          to take her hand in mine, and I studied her beautiful face, with her 
          high cheekbones, seductive lips, and piercing blue-gray eyes. Her hair 
          still reached her lovely ass, and I ached to to hold her again, smelling 
          her sexy perfume as I softly stroked her hair with my fingertips. I 
          couldn't really name the perfume she was wearing, as I don't really 
          keep up with that sort of thing, but it had suggestions of musk, strawberries, 
          mango, and vanilla, all bundled up into one fragrance. It was quite 
          enticing.</p>
        <p> &quot;It's been *way* too long, Danny&quot; she whispered into my 
          ear as she put her arm around my waist, with her hand resting on my 
          hip. Her arm around my waist brought back many fond memories of a time 
          not so long ago. &quot;I'm getting wet just being near you,&quot; she 
          purred with hunger in her eyes. </p>
        <p> &quot;Don't worry... the end of the millennium is near,&quot; I quipped 
          with a smile, and turned toward her, taking her in my arms, resting 
          my hands on her firm shapely ass. I softly caressed her there, letting 
          my hands wander over her rounded swells, and I heard a soft sigh escape 
          her lips. She looked into my brown eyes lovingly, and we exchanged a 
          heated kiss, our tongues swirling slowly in our mouths. I moved my hands 
          to her curvaceous hips, and as she massaged my lower back, I positioned 
          one of my hands near the button of her fatigues, slowly working the 
          button free. I slowly worked her zipper down, easing her fatigues down 
          her softly rounded hips, and I felt her hands gliding across my chest 
          as her tongue darted rapidly in and out of my mouth. </p>
        <p> She deftly stepped out of her pants as they hit the floor. I proceeded 
          to slowly slide my hand down her sensitive stomach and into her sexy 
          black panties, and was pleasantly surprised to find her smoothly shaven. 
          I sensuously sucked on her tongue as it entered my mouth, my finger 
          finding her moist slit, and I slowly ran my finger along her moist swollen 
          lips. Bringing my wet finger to my lips, I savored the taste of her 
          tangy nectar as Beth gazed at me with reawakened desire, and I eased 
          her panties down her long slender legs. A mouth watering sight, indeed. 
          I returned two fingers to her now wet inviting pussy, and she unsnapped 
          the button on my khakis and eased the zipper down, my hard cock coming 
          into view. <br>
          <br>
          I removed her t-shirt, revealing the striking contrast between her deeply 
          tanned skin and her milky-white pert breasts, and she wrapped her hand 
          around my throbbing essence as I softly kissed and sucked upon her taut 
          nipples. My pants fell slowly to the kitchen floor, and I took her pleasantly 
          rounded cheeks into my hands and pulled her tightly to me, quite certain 
          she felt the heat of my throbbing shaft upon her flat stomach. </p>
        <p> Guiding her to the kitchen table, she sat upon it, and I took a second 
          to take in her inviting wet slit and firm breasts. I stepped between 
          her long slender legs, and as I ran my hands up her sides, she pressed 
          her head forward to kiss me seductively, running her tongue along the 
          outline of my lips. Tracing a path of kisses down her neck, I proceeded 
          to her heaving chest, and I felt her hands in my hair, gently guiding 
          me toward her breasts. </p>
        <p> I arrived at her firm breasts, taking each of her excited nipples 
          into my mouth in turn, softly sucking and flicking my tongue until I 
          heard her softly moan. Kissing my way across her flat stomach, I took 
          her hips in my hands as I reached the beginning of the smooth white 
          skin usually hidden by bikini bottoms. Inhaling the scent of her tangy 
          juices as I moved to kiss both of her widely spread inner thighs, I 
          slowly ran my flattened tongue up the entire length of her swollen pussy, 
          savoring the exotic flavor of her abundant nectar.<br>
          <br>
          I eased my tongue into her grasping slit, feeling her delicate hands 
          on my head gently urging me onward as I begin a slow rhythm inside her. 
          I pressed my tongue into her aroused pouty lips as far as I could manage, 
          and brought my middle finger to the tiny entrance of her puckered rosebud. 
          I took a slow extended suck on her dewy slit, drawing her distended 
          lips into my mouth, and I bathe them with my tongue. Easing my finger 
          into her splendid ass, I could feel her pushing her firm derriere toward 
          me. </p>
        <p> As my finger slowly entered her ass, I surrounded her prominent clitoris 
          with my lips, softly sucking on her sensitive nub while lightly caressing 
          it with the tip of my tongue. I heard her begin to mutter incoherently, 
          almost under her breath, clenching and unclenching her fists. My finger 
          slid into her tight ass as I began sucking with vigor on her proud jutting 
          clit, and she orgasmed exuberantly, moaning and thrusting her hips up 
          at my face, crying out my name. I gently removed my finger from her 
          puckered ring, and as I hungrily lapped her abundant juices, she looked 
          upward with her eyes in the back of her head, biting her lower lip. 
        </p>
        <p> She rose and kissed me with aroused desire, seductively sucking on 
          my tongue, tasting herself on my lips, and eased herself off of the 
          table. She knelt in front of me, looking up with lust in her eyes, and 
          took me in her hand. She gently kissed the swollen head, tenderly licking 
          away the drop of pre-cum that had formed, and then slowly swirled her 
          talented tongue around the bloated crown. I looked down at her comely 
          face as I gently swept the hair from her eyes, and I thought back to 
          when we were a loving couple. It seemed, at that moment at least, that 
          we still were a couple. She began a slow motion with her mouth, leisurely 
          inching her lips down my pulsing cock, and she brought her hand up to 
          my cum-filled balls, cradling them in her palm.</p>
        <p> I reached down to very softly manipulate her perky nipples, and I 
          could have sworn she gazed up at me with a suggestion of a smile in 
          her eyes. She rapidly moved her lips up and down my stiffness, and I 
          took her head softly in my hands to guide her, rejoicing in the incredible 
          pleasure her talented lips and tongue were applying to my throbbing 
          shaft. I felt my cock swelling, and I thought she sensed it as well, 
          as she looked directly into my eyes while engulfing the length of my 
          prick in one motion, forcing it into her throat. Beth brought her hands 
          to her pert breasts, meeting my hands there, and she joined me in gently 
          caressing her perky breasts. She quickened her pace, taking the entire 
          length of my hard shaft into her mouth, and it slipped into her throat 
          as she sucked harder.</p>
        <p> As I began to cum into her welcoming mouth, she looked directly into 
          my eyes, and I noted the contentment in her pretty blue-gray eyes. The 
          first portion of my warm pearly white essence was propelled to the back 
          of her throat, and she hungrily swallowed the healthy streams of jism 
          that followed. Waves of orgasmic pleasure spread throughout my body, 
          and I leaned on the table to keep my balance. </p>
        <p> After I emptied myself into her mouth, she continued to use her tongue 
          while sucking gently on my sensitive cock for what seemed to be quite 
          a while, and in time, I was hard enough to enter her again. She seemed 
          insatiable. She got up from her knees, sat on the table once again, 
          and as she spread her legs wide for me, her glistening hole beckoned 
          me. I approached her tentatively, and I rubbed the head of my sensitive 
          shaft along the pink flesh of her swollen pussy lips, moistening it 
          with her rather abundant juices. With her hands on my hips, she pulled 
          me very slowly into her, muttering stimulating phrases lustily into 
          my ear as she did.<br>
          <br>
          I initiated a slow rhythm inside of her, and I looked down and saw her 
          outstretched lips clinging to my bulging cock as I withdrew. I thrust 
          my stiffened shaft inside of her to the hilt as she moaned loudly, and 
          saw her looking up at me with abandon in her eyes. I picked up momentum 
          gradually, and watched in awe as her head flailed from side to side 
          in pre-orgasmic ecstasy, mouthing silent phrases. </p>
        <p> I became aware of her fingers coming down and softly fondling her 
          erect clit, and as I withdrew from a powerful thrust inside her, she 
          reached down to position the bloated head at the entrance to her tight 
          ass. I eased my hard prick into her restricting ass, very gradually 
          pressing into her tight asshole until my hips touched the firm flesh 
          of her shapely cheeks, and I began a moderate rhythm inside her puckered 
          rosebud. She began to suck temptingly on my neck, whispering enticingly, 
          &quot;Yes! Yes! Fuck me, baby!&quot;, into my ear in cadence with my 
          thrusts as I began to fuck her harder.</p>
        <p> She pushed against the oncoming thrusts, wrapping her legs around 
          my lower back, and I continued to push deeply into her exquisite ass. 
          As I took one final push into her, I let out a loud moan as I unleashed 
          a great deal of warm pearly cum, and I could feel her contracting in 
          orgasm as I did. We shared a soulful kiss as I emptied my load between 
          her tight cheeks, and as we gazed at each other with loving eyes, we 
          both broke into contented smiles.</p>
        <p> After lazing together on the table for about an hour or so, gathering 
          up our strength, cuddling and kissing each other with renewed feeling, 
          Beth spoke up. &quot;Umm, do you think that coffee might be ready?&quot; 
          she asked facetiously, kissed me tenderly on the lips, then added, &quot;And 
          I was just wondering... do you have a bedroom in here, Danny?&quot; 
          she kidded with a sly smile.<br>
