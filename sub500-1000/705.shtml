      <td colspan="2" width="100%"> <!-- #BeginEditable "story" -->I was staring 
        at my computer screen and counting the seconds until quitting time when 
        a female voice penetrated my thoughts.<p>
        &quot;Knock, knock.&quot;<p>
        &quot;What now?&quot; I mumbled to myself. It had been a busy week, and 
        I was perfectly content to spend the rest of my Friday afternoon staring 
        at the monitor and daydreaming. The last thing I needed was for someone 
        to come to me with some problem that had to be solved right away. I rolled 
        my chair back and turned to see Aimee Sinclair standing at the entrance 
        of my tiny cubicle.<p>
        &quot;Hi!&quot; I said, pleasantly surprised. Aimee worked in a group 
        that had very little interaction with my own, so I was relatively sure 
        that this was a social visit. &quot;What brings you here?&quot;<p>
        &quot;I had to drop something off with Mike up the aisle, and when I walked 
        by and saw you working so hard I thought I would drop in to visit.&quot; 
        We both smiled. It was obvious that she had witnessed me sitting around 
        doing nothing. &quot;How have you been?&quot; she asked with her slight 
        northern accent.<p>
        We continued to exchange idle pleasantries and catch up with each other 
        for the next few minutes. Even though we had been working for the same 
        company for over a year, it was the first time we had spoken to each other 
        in a couple of months. The corporate campus consisted of several large 
        buildings, each housing a few thousand employees, and we had jobs that 
        didn't bring us into contact. It was a shame, because I had known Aimee 
        for just over seven years, and we had always enjoyed talking to each other. 
        <p>
        We'd first met in high school at the beginning of my senior year. Aimee 
        was a junior and her family had just moved to the area from Pennsylvania. 
        She was a very cute girl who had instantly caught the eye of most of the 
        boys. I met her when she started dating a friend of mine. The relationship 
        didn't last long, but the two of us had continued to talk occasionally. 
        The next fall, I went off to college, and a year after that she started 
        at the same school. It wasn't much of a surprise since there aren't many 
        options for aspiring engineers in the south. Thanks to lack of ambition 
        and a little too much partying it had taken me five years to graduate. 
        My GPA was far from spectacular, so when the company I'd interned with 
        offered me a position I jumped at the chance, even though I knew the job 
        would be stressful and mundane. Aimee, on the other hand, had been an 
        excellent student and was one of the elite few to get out in four years. 
        She had ended up in the executive training program with the same multimillion 
        dollar international conglomerate that employed me and about 20,000 other 
        Atlanta residents.<p>
        Our conversation continued pleasantly, and I actually was able to forget 
        about my clockwatching for a few minutes. Aimee was about five and half 
        feet tall with a great smile and trim figure, so she was pleasant on the 
        eyes. Plus, she was very witty and just fun to talk to. She was even uncharacteristically 
        polite for a northerner. She was talking about the unseasonably warm weather 
        when I noticed the rock she was wearing. &quot;Wait a second,&quot; I 
        said. &quot;What the hell is that?&quot;<p>
        It took her a second to realize where I was pointing. She looked a little 
        embarrassed. &quot;Oh, it's nothing,&quot; she said. &quot;I got engaged 
        last month.&quot;<p>
        &quot;It's nothing?&quot; I said. &quot;That sounds like something to 
        me. Who's the unlucky guy?&quot; I joked. <p>
        &quot;No one you know,&quot; she responded. She looked a little nervous 
        as she talked. &quot;A guy named Gregory that I met a while back. A friend 
        of a friend.&quot;<p>
        &quot;And what kind of work does young Gregory do?&quot; I asked in my 
        best nosy neighbor voice.<p>
        &quot;He's a lawyer,&quot; she answered, &quot;And he's actually not very 
        young. He's in his late twenties.&quot;<p>
        &quot;Well, an older man and a lawyer. Congratulations,&quot; I said. 
        &quot;And you're on the fast path to being the company's next vice-president, 
        and all of this at the ripe old age of 22. Mama Sinclair must be proud 
        of you!&quot;<p>
        &quot;Thanks,&quot; she said. Once again I got the impression that she 
        wasn't comfortable with the subject. &quot;I guess she is.&quot;<p>
        There was an awkward silence. Despite my sincere wish of congratulations, 
        I couldn't help feeling a little disappointed. I'd always been interested 
        in Aimee in a romantic way. I had known several girls that were prettier 
        than her, but I hadn't met many women with her combination of good looks, 
        intelligence, and great personality. Still, I'd never acted on my impulses, 
        and now it looked like the time had passed.<p>
        The gap in the conversation seemed to go on forever before Aimee ended 
        it. &quot;Well, I have to get back to work,&quot; she said. &quot;I'll 
        talk to you later.&quot;<p>
        &quot;Don't forget to invite me to the wedding,&quot; I said teasingly.<p>
        She gave a half-hearted laugh. &quot;Yeah, I won't.&quot; She turned to 
        leave then paused. &quot;Are you going to the company Christmas party 
        tomorrow night?&quot; she asked. <p>
        There was no way in hell that I planned on spending my free time at a 
        work event, but I chose a more appropriate answer. &quot;I haven't decided 
        yet, how about you?&quot; <p>
        &quot;Yes,&quot; she said. &quot;We're going.&quot; I assumed she was 
        referring to her fianc&eacute; and herself. &quot;Well, if you're there 
        maybe I'll see you then.&quot; She turned and walked off. I took another 
        moment to lament the fact that she was now 'off the market', and then 
        I went back to staring at my monitor. Less than a minute had passed when 
        I was interrupted once again.<p>
        &quot;Knock, knock,&quot; called a female voice.<p>
        My first thought was that Aimee had returned for some reason, but my brain 
        quickly processed that the soft spoken northern accent had been replaced 
        by a gruffer, Bostonian intonation. This time it was Melody Brown blocking 
        the entrance to my little prison cell. Melody was the human resources 
        representative for our area, in charge of such important tasks as promoting 
        company events and boosting worker morale. She had also interviewed me 
        for my job. Of course, at that time she had been wearing an elaborate 
        engagement ring and gold wedding band on her hand, and now she was two 
        months removed from an extremely messy divorce. Still, whenever I saw 
        her she flashed me that big fake smile that every HR person seems to possess.<p>
        &quot;Hi Melody, what can I do for you?&quot; I asked.<p>
        She flashed me that shit eating grin before she began. &quot;Well, I was 
        just up the aisle and I thought I overheard you say you might not make 
        it to the Christmas party.&quot;<p>
        &quot;You've got good ears,&quot; I responded with my best fake smile. 
        &quot;That's what I said.&quot;<p>
        &quot;Why not?&quot; she asked with a mock frown. &quot;It's going to 
        be a lot of fun. There will be food, dancing, and an open bar.&quot;<p>
        The open bar sounded inviting, but it still wasn't enough to get me excited. 
        I searched my mind desperately for an excuse. &quot;Well,&quot; I said, 
        &quot;I kind of forgot about it, and now I don't really have time to find 
        a date.&quot;<p>
        &quot;Well, that's kind of good news,&quot; Melody said. This time her 
        smile seemed more authentic. <p>
        &quot;How so?&quot;<p>
        &quot;Well,&quot; she said. &quot;I wanted to know if you wanted to be 
        my date?&quot; I had first met Melody about four years earlier, after 
        my sophomore year in college, and this is the first time she had ever 
        seemed less than 100% positive of herself. That surprised me almost as 
        much as her offer. Melody was about five foot ten and very attractive. 
        She had short curly blonde hair, bright green eyes, long legs, and a very 
        tight, athletic figure that she obviously put a lot of time into. What 
        made the offer so shocking is that she had just turned 30 years old in 
        November, making her 7 years my elder.<p>
        I was so taken aback that I didn't know what to say. It came as a shock 
        to my brain when I heard myself own mouth say &quot;That would be cool.&quot; 
        My response was greeted with her 'authentic smile', and we talked for 
        the next few minutes making arrangements. Mostly she talked, while I continued 
        to marvel at her surprising offer and my more surprising acceptance.<p>
        &quot;Well, I'll see you tomorrow evening,&quot; Melody finally said. 
        She gave me a wink then turned sharply on her heels and left me alone 
        with my astonishment. No one came to my cube for the rest of the day, 
        so I had plenty of time to replay the sequence of events that had led 
        me to making a date to a company party with a recently divorced, thirty 
        year old woman who happened to hold a job that I had absolutely no respect 
        for. 
        <p><p>
          Friday evening was spent with a group of friends, a deck of cards, a 
          carton of smokes, and several large bottles of liquor. When I woke up 
          the next morning on my friends couch with a throbbing headache and a 
          sore throat and a stiff neck I thought things couldn't possibly get 
          and worse, but then I remembered the company party. I sorted through 
          the discarded cigarette boxes until I found one that had somehow survived 
          the rowdy evening. For the most part, I had quit smoking after college, 
          but for some reason I was having a major craving. I woke up the other 
          guys who had crashed in various locations, and after a greasy Waffle 
          House breakfast I went home to my rented townhouse. After a short nap 
          and a shower, I started to feel a little better.<p>
          I still wasn't keen on the idea of attending an offsite company function, 
          but I was intrigued by my date. I had finally gotten over the shock 
          of Melody's proposal, and I was able to look at it in an analytical 
          fashion. The age difference was definitely part of the surprise, but 
          what had really gotten me was that the offer had come from out of the 
          blue. I couldn't recall any instance in which Melody had shown an interest 
          in me. We rarely spoke to each other outside of saying &quot;Hello&quot;, 
          and the conversations we had shared were mostly comprised of the kind 
          of idle chit chat that goes on between coworkers more out of courtesy 
          than interest. The only reason I knew about her divorce was from hearsay 
          and gossip. <p>
          Curiosity was causing me to look forward to the party. Plus, even though 
          I could only to be around Melody in small doses, there was no denying 
          that she was very attractive. Her body was fit and lean, and she had 
          a sophisticated yet sexy way of presenting herself. On more than one 
          occasion I had favored her with a second look, and I had actually caught 
          myself ogling her a few times in long meetings or presentations. The 
          thought of walking into the room with her on my arm made me smile. I 
          also new that it would cause the company rumor mill to work overtime. 
          Not only would there be the normal gossip about an interoffice relationship-all 
          the nosey people would also be spreading theories about a May-December 
          romance. As I continued to think about it, I realized that the evening 
          would not be that bad.</p>
        <p>A few hours later I followed the directions Melody had given me to 
          her house in the suburbs. It was a modest sized place that she had no 
          doubt inherited in her divorce settlement. I felt like Regis Philbin 
          in my dark suit and shiny tie, and I had actually bothered to run a 
          comb through my longish brown hair for the first time in weeks. I didn't 
          bother to take a razor to the two days worth of stubble on my face though. 
          The dress code for the party had been purposely vague. Apparently some 
          genius in HR had realized that not all people liked to dressy fancy, 
          so they had told people to just dress as they see fit. Melody has chosen 
          to go with a conservative business look instead of a ball dress. It's 
          would I had anticipated from the consummate professional. She was wearing 
          a pale pink suit that was comprised of a short skirt and matching three 
          button top. She had a pair of stockings on her long, muscular legs, 
          and white heels capped off the ensemble. She greeted me with a polite 
          kiss on the cheek and I took her arm to escort her to my car. I felt 
          a little awkward and worried that we would have nothing to talk about 
          because of the age difference, but Melody proved capable of diffusing 
          the situation by starting a polite conversation that continued through 
          the entire drive back to the center of the city.<p>
          When we got to the hotel I handed my keys to the valet and escorted 
          my date into the large ballroom. I was absolutely shocked by the number 
          of people that were there. I had expected it to be a room full of HR 
          people and brown nosers looking to score some points with the executives, 
          but the turnout was actually rather large. The room was packed with 
          people, most of whom I didn't know. The majority of the guys were wearing 
          shirts and ties, but a few had went all out with their tuxedos, and 
          a handful of slackers were sporting the business casual look, which 
          I had contemplated myself. The women, on the other hand, were dressed 
          in an array of outfits. Like Melody, some had chosen a professional 
          look, but there were plenty of women in formal dresses, and large amount 
          dressed in trendy outfits. Lot of them were showing there Christmas 
          spirit with colorful red or green ensembles. I stood taking in the spectacle 
          until I noticed the bar on the other side of the room. As Melody rushed 
          off to talk to a friend I introduced myself with the bartender, tipped 
          him ten dollars, and told him he would be seeing a lot of me. I took 
          a couple of quick shots, then went wandering back through the crowd 
          with a mixed drink and a glass of champagne for my date.<p>
          As I rejoined Melody, the DJ who had apparently been on break returned 
          to the microphone and proclaimed that &quot;Eighties Eddie was ready 
          to take this party up a notch.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Beautiful,&quot; I mumbled to myself. Nothing makes a bunch of 
          half drunk middle aged people happier than singing along with Paula 
          Abdul and MC Hammer. As if he were reading my mind, Eighties Eddie got 
          things going with a little &quot;Can't Touch This.&quot; <p>
          &quot;I love this song,&quot; Melody said as she grabbed my arm. Somehow 
          I knew she would. She took the glass of champagne and I chugged the 
          rest of my drink as she whisked me off towards the dance floor. She 
          led the way with me in tow. &quot;Do you want to dance?&quot; she asked 
          with a big smile. Fortunately, it was an authentic smile and not the 
          HR face. Apparently she had left that at home for the evening. <p>
          &quot;Thank God for small favors,&quot; I muttered inaudibly. Then I 
          gave her my best fake smile and said &quot;Why not?&quot; as we joined 
          a hundred other couples on the parquet floor. </p>
        <p>Two hours and several drinks later I finally sat down at a table to 
          rest my legs. I was drunk and Melody was getting there. We had been 
          dancing and mingling constantly and my legs were killing me. Out of 
          the handful of guys that I spent time with at work, only one had been 
          lame enough to come to the party, so most of the people we'd talked 
          to had been Melody's friends. The conversations were about as exciting 
          as watching paint dry, but the cautious whispers and veiled stares were 
          enough to keep me intrigued. Almost everyone we talked to had to resist 
          the urge to do a double take when I was introduced as her date. Thanks 
          mostly to the alcohol, I was actually having a good time, and Melody 
          has apparently left her more annoying personality traits back at the 
          office with her fake smile.<p>
          I sat at the table watching the crowd of people while Melody went to 
          get us a couple of drinks. I was starting to wonder what this date was 
          going to lead to when I felt a hand on my shoulder. <p>
          &quot;I didn't expect to see you here.&quot; I looked up to see Aimee 
          standing with a tall good looking fellow. <p>
          &quot;Hi, how are you?&quot; I asked. &quot;This must be the infamous 
          Gregory.&quot;<p>
          &quot;That it is,&quot; her date said as he extended his hand. <p>
          I stood up to shake it and introduced myself.<p>
          &quot;I've heard a lot about you,&quot; I lied. <p>
          &quot;Don't listen to any of it,&quot; Gregory joked. <p>
          &quot;Are you here alone?&quot; Aimee asked. <p>
          &quot;No, here comes my date now,&quot; I responded as Melody came up 
          beside me. Aimee tried to hide the surprise on her face and failed. 
          Everyone made their introductions after Gregory started talking about 
          his sore legs the couple decided to join us at the table for a few drinks. 
          Everyone chatted, mostly about work, so naturally I had no interest 
          in the conversation. As Gregory explained the rewarding feeling that 
          comes from working on a big case, I couldn't help checking out his fianc&eacute;. 
          Aimee had went with a party girl look. She was wearing a bright red 
          halter top that tied behind her neck, and short gray skirt with vents 
          on each side. Her brown hair, which she normally wore in a pony tail, 
          was now pushed back on each side with ornate combs. She sat pushed back 
          from the table with her legs crossed, and her short skirt and stocking 
          really showed them off. It was also very obvious that she wasn't wearing 
          a bra. The outfit was somewhat revealing for winter, but it had been 
          unseasonably warm, and it was extremely hot out on the dance floor.<p>
          For the most part, Gregory and Melody were dominating the conversation, 
          with Aimee chiming in occasionally. I was in my own little world, concentrating 
          hard on not paying attention to anything that was said. I was actually 
          surprised when something Aimee said caught my attention.<p>
          &quot;Ooh!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I love that song.&quot; Eighties 
          Eddie has just announced that it was time for the doves to cry. Apparently 
          his taste had improved slightly over the last few hours. &quot;Honey, 
          let's dance,&quot; she said as she stood up.<p>
          &quot;Dear, my legs our killing me,&quot; Gregory responded. &quot;I 
          really need this breather.&quot; <p>
          Aimee flashed Gregory a pouty face that I thought was very cute, but 
          it seemed to annoy him. &quot;Why don't you guys go dance?&quot; he 
          said looking in my direction. Gregory wasn't the only one with sore 
          legs, but the idea of taking the dance floor with Aimee was somewhat 
          appealing.<p>
          &quot;Yeah honey, go ahead,&quot; Melody said. I wasn't entirely pleased 
          with being called honey. <p>
          &quot;Would you like to dance, my lady?&quot; I asked Aimee in a eloquent 
          manner.<p>
          &quot;Certainly, kind sir,&quot; Aimee said as she mocked a curtsy. 
          I stood and took her hand and headed to the floor.<p>
          &quot;You kids have fun,&quot; Melody called out. I winced at being 
          called a &quot;kid&quot; by my date. It didn't escape Aimee's attention.<p>
          &quot;I don't mean to be rude,&quot; she began, &quot;but what the hell 
          are you&#133;.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Don't ask,&quot; I said. &quot;I don't know the answer.&quot;<p>
          Aimee looked a little confused, but she shrugged it off as we made our 
          way to the center of the dance floor. That first recognizable guitar 
          riff was starting to squelch out of the large speakers and Aimee took 
          my hand and started to move. I started up with the normal bad moves 
          that defined my horrific dancing ability. It was somewhere between John 
          Travolta in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and Michael Jackson circa 1983 
          and had been cultivated in the midst of one of many drunken college 
          parties. <p>
          As the music filled the air, the differences between Aimee and my date 
          were immediately noticeable. Melody was a decent dancer, but everything 
          was very controlled and appeared to be premeditated. Aimee, on the other 
          hand, just seemed to move with the music. Every move seemed natural 
          and graceful, and she exuded youthfulness and femininity. I was suddenly 
          very aware of her as a woman. She was sensual, yet it was completely 
          unintentional. She smiled and giggled at my own pathetic moves, but 
          in a polite way that made me feel less self conscious. I let go of my 
          restraint and just started to have fun. Aimee placed my hands on her 
          hips and reached up to my shoulders. Her sensual dance moves combined 
          with my awkward ones and they seemed to blend together, and suddenly 
          I found myself chiming in with the Purple One as he asked &quot;Why 
          do we scream at each other?&quot; My singing ability had always been 
          the polar opposite of my dancing, and Aimee beamed brightly as I continued 
          to sing along.<p>
          I had sung that song at least a thousand times in my young life, but 
          for the first time I was keenly aware of the sensual lyrics. Aimee had 
          moved closer to me, and I was singing almost directly into her ear. 
          I suddenly felt as if we were alone on the dance floor. The hard dance 
          beat seemed to fill the room, and every few seconds our bodies brushed 
          against one another. <p>
          The room seemed to be spinning, but it wasn't caused<p>
          by the alcohol. </p>
        <p>The song stopped, and the room was once again filled with people. We 
          were so deep in the crowd that I could barely see our table across the 
          room. As the people shuffled around I caught a glimpse of Gregory and 
          Melody. They appeared to be totally engrossed in their conversation. 
          I started to walk in their direction as the next song started. I felt 
          a hand on my shoulder.<p>
          &quot;Where are you going?&quot; Aimee asked as she pulled me back in 
          her direction. Eighties Eddie continued on a good streak by playing 
          The Cars &quot;Just What I Needed&quot;. Aimee left some air between 
          us as she started to dance again, and this time it was her turn to sing. 
          &quot;I don't mind you coming here, and wasting all my time,&quot; she 
          crooned along with the music. Her big brown eyes were locked on me, 
          and she sung as if the lyrics were directed at me. She wagged her left 
          index finger in my direction and smiled, and again I was taken with 
          her unconscious sensuality and femininity. Her doe eyes were filled 
          with something that I would have mistaken for lust, if it weren't for 
          the big diamond on that left hand.<p>
          Again, I felt like we were the only ones on the dance floor. I took 
          one of Aimee's hands and pulled her closer. She pretended to resist 
          before closing the distance between us. She continued to dance and sing, 
          and I was intently focused on her. Her hips swayed gently with the beat 
          of the music. The tips of her light brown hair drifted across her bare 
          shoulder. Her smallish, nicely shaped breasts shifted gently inside 
          her halter top. I eyed every inch of her body, but her big brown eyes 
          stayed locked on my face. She was still singing, but it appeared to 
          be unconsciously. The chorus of the song kept repeating in my mind. 
          &quot;I think you're just what I needed.&quot; <p>
          Aimee was moving closer now. Her eyes were still locked on my own. I 
          couldn't help but notice how casually graceful she was in every movement. 
          We continued to dance with the beat, but the world seemed to be in slow 
          motion. She was close enough now that we were brushing together. I placed 
          my hands back on her hips without thinking about it. I felt a tingling 
          in the pit of my stomach.<p>
          The song ended, and Eighties Eddie quickly transitioned to the next 
          one. It was &quot;Eyes Without a Face&quot;, a slower ballad. It seemed 
          appropriate, because Aimee's eyes were the only thing on my mind. She 
          seemed to be staring straight into my soul with unblinking intensity. 
          Her eyes were like deep brown pools, and I found myself lost in her 
          gaze. She pressed up against me now, as our bodies moved to the slow 
          rhythm. My senses seemed to be heightened. Everything about her caught 
          my attention and overwhelmed me. I could feel the soft curvature of 
          her breast that were pushed against my chest. Her body was soft and 
          warm. I traced a finger down her bare shoulder and noticed how silky 
          smooth her skin was. I rested a cheek on her head, and marveled at the 
          softness of her hair, and it's fragrant, pleasing smell. <p>
          Without thinking, I slipped my hands around to her ass. My cock was 
          now awake and stirring in my pants, and I knew that she would notice. 
          I tried to stop the natural reaction by reminding myself that she was 
          engaged, and I was obviously misreading her signs. It was a fight I 
          couldn't win. My penis was now semi-stiff and pressed firmly against 
          Aimee's stomach. Still, here gaze was not wavering. I suddenly felt 
          the need to kiss her. It welled up in my stomach and flowed through 
          my whole body. I started to tremble as I fought the urge.<p>
          &quot;What are you waiting for?&quot; someone asked. I turned to my 
          shoulder, expecting to see the a little guy with a pitch fork and pointed 
          tale on my shoulder. When I didn't see him, I realized it was Aimee 
          who had spoke.<p>
          &quot;What did you say?&quot; I asked in a hushed voice.<p>
          &quot;I said 'What are you waiting for?'&quot; she repeated. She was 
          still gazing up into my eyes, and now there was no mistaking the lust 
          buried in those big brown pools. &quot;Nobody's looking,&quot; she said.<p>
          I looked around and saw that she was right. Somehow we had drifted to 
          a dark corner of the dance floor. No other couples were close, and we 
          were completely shielded from our dates. Still, I couldn't believe what 
          she was asking. I continued to dance, saying nothing.<p>
          &quot;We don't have all night,&quot; she said. &quot;Are you going to 
          kiss me?&quot; Her clipped accent concealed the emotion she was feeling, 
          but I could see it in her bedroom eyes. I stood shocked for a second, 
          but then I realized she was right. I discarded all rational thought, 
          and leaned forward to taste her inviting lips. I pulled Aimee's body 
          tightly against mine and our lips met. She moaned softly, and then her 
          mouth opened slightly, allowing our tongues to touch. I slid my hands 
          up and down her back as we kissed slowly and passionately for several 
          seconds. We were lost in the moment until the song ended. Finally, we 
          parted and each took a step back. We were both trying to catch our breath 
          as we stood gazing at one another. Aimee looked a little bewildered. 
          &quot;I can't believe what we just did,&quot; she said. <p>
          I started to speak but stopped when someone tapped me on the shoulder. 
          I turned to see Gregory. For a brief moment I thought he had witnessed 
          our transaction and was coming to kill me. &quot;Mind if I cut in?&quot; 
          he asked cheerfully. &quot;I want to dance with my lovely wife-to-be.&quot; 
          He was grinning from ear to ear, and I knew that we had gotten away 
          with our indiscretion. Still, I was perplexed by what had happened. 
          Had the two of us just gotten carried away in the moment? Had out kiss 
          been the result of alcohol and pheromones? Or was there something more? 
        </p>
        <p>Much to my displeasure, we didn't have the opportunity to figure it 
          out. Gregory swept Aimee off to the middle of the dance floor, and Melody 
          came over to pull me in another direction. The two of us started to 
          dance with the next song, but I was constantly looking over her shoulder 
          trying to locate Aimee. Unfortunately, she kept moving farther and farther 
          away, and eventually I lost them in the crowd. <p>
          Meanwhile, Melody's dancing was more suggestive than earlier. The alcohol 
          had apparently gone to her head, and she was dancing closer, brushing 
          her body against mine. She brushed against the erection Aimee had given 
          me almost immediately, and she obviously thought it was intended for 
          her. I assumed that she would be appalled, but her reaction was the 
          opposite of my expectations. I took a drink from a nearby waiter and 
          quickly downed it.<p>
          Apparently Eighties Eddie could only handle good music in small doses, 
          because the next song was Ton Loc's &quot;The Wild Thing&quot;. <p>
          &quot;I love this song,&quot; Melody said, somewhat seductively. She 
          wrapped her arms tightly around my waist and pulled me closer to her. 
          The alcohol must have finally dulled my senses, because I didn't find 
          her ridiculous attempt at rapping along to be that offensive. Melody 
          started grinding her pelvis into mine, causing a lot of friction against 
          my enlarged penis. For the first time all night, her actions were not 
          typical and predicable. I made one last attempt at locating Aimee, and 
          when it failed I abandoned hope and gave in to temptation. I wrapped 
          my hand around Melody's waist and began to grind back, letting her feel 
          how horny I was getting. I had always admired her body, but as she pressed 
          it firmly against mine, I realized for the first time just how tight 
          and fit she was. Her small bosom was crushed against my chest, and I 
          could feel her rock hard nipples through all the layers of clothing. 
          I slipped my hands down and began to fondle her taut little ass. <p>
          &quot;It's getting kind of late,&quot; Melody said. I glanced at my 
          watch and saw that it was 10:30, actually pretty early. We had only 
          been at the party for about two and a half hours, although the fifteen 
          minutes I had spent dancing with Aimee had seemed like a lifetime. &quot;I'm 
          getting tired,&quot; she continued, &quot;and I don't think we're in 
          any condition to drive home. How about we get a room?&quot;<p>
          It didn't take a genius to read between the lines. I didn't answer right 
          away. Part of me wanted to go and find Aimee, although I didn't know 
          what I would say, or how she would react. My eyes darted around the 
          room trying to find her, but to no avail. <p>
          &quot;C'mon,&quot; Melody whispered in my ear. &quot;Don't you want 
          to do 'the wild thing'?&quot; Her voice was thick with desire. She slipped 
          a hand between our bodies and touched my erection. &quot;I'm aching 
          to be fucked by a young stud!&quot; she said in her thick New England 
          accent.</p>
        <p>I couldn't resist anymore. &quot;Let's go,&quot; I said.<p>
          Melody wormed her way through the crowd in the direction of the exit. 
          I followed closely with one hand planted on her tight little ass. We 
          proceeded to the front desk, where Melody produced her platinum card. 
          The clerk eyes us suspiciously at first-a guy barely out of college 
          and an older woman, neither of us carrying luggage-but he quickly went 
          back to his and a few minutes later we were standing in the lobby waiting 
          for the elevator that would deliver us to our posh junior suite on the 
          fortieth floor.<p>
          There was no restraining my lust. As we waited, I pinned Melody against 
          the wall and kissed her for the first time. Our lips met with hunger 
          and passion. The kiss bared no resemblance the one I had shared with 
          Aimee. I ran one hand through her curly blonde hair, while the other 
          slid up her thigh, pushing her skirt upward until I touched the bare 
          skin above her stockings. I pushed all my weight against her, letting 
          her feel the large bulge in my pants. Co-workers leaving the party were 
          now straggling past us, but we didn't pay attention. <p>
          Finally, the elevator chimed and the doors slid open. We stepped inside 
          and began kissing again. Melody's hands slipped in between us and opened 
          my zipper. She fished her hand around in my pants and pulled out my 
          throbbing cock. The elevator walls were mirrors, and as I continued 
          to kiss Melody I watcher her pump my cock in the reflection. It was 
          getting extremely hard and turning purple at the tip. I was considering 
          stopping the elevator so we could fuck when it slowed down on it's own. 
          When we saw that we weren't to our floor yet Melody quickly turned around 
          to face the door and pressed her ass against me, concealing my exposed 
          cock. <p>
          The doors slid open and a bell hop stepped in. As the elevator started 
          up, he turned so his back was too us. Melody slipped a hand behind her 
          back and tried to discretely stroke my cock. She didn't notice that 
          the bell boy was watching us in the reflection. I just smiled and winked 
          at him, and didn't say a word. Fortunately, he got off on the floor 
          below us, so we didn't have to walk off the elevator with my cock hanging 
          out.<p>
          When the elevator reached our floor Melody stepped off first as I tucked 
          my hard on back into my pants. The thin material did little too conceal 
          the tent I was pitching. As she stood across the hall waiting, I noticed 
          that her nipples were hard enough to show through her pale pink jacket. 
          I strode out of the elevator and pinned her to the wall again. I didn't 
          think I could make it down the hall to our room. I pushed up her short 
          pink skirt and half slip, exposing her naked upper thighs and lacy leopard 
          print panties. I placed my hand directly above her pussy and began to 
          rub it. The satin panties were drenched with her warm juices. I slid 
          her along the wall in the direction of our room and continued to rub 
          her pussy.<p>
          Our room was the tenth door on the opposite side of the hall from the 
          elevator. As we made our way towards it, I think we slammed into every 
          door we passed. We were kissing passionately. Melody slipped her hands 
          back into my pants and started stroking my dick again. I opened the 
          three buttons on her jacket, exposing her bra. It was a sheer leopard 
          print that clung tightly to her perky little breasts. Her hard nipples 
          stuck out like pencil erasers. As I worked the key card into the reader, 
          one of the doors we had brushed against swung open. The head of a confused 
          white haired man popped out. His hair was in disarray and he was wearing 
          only a t-shirt. I didn't even acknowledge him as I continued to rub 
          Melody's panties and tits. She kept her hands in my pants. The old man 
          got an eyeful of her elevated skirt and open top, but then we were in 
          the room and the door swung shut behind us. <p>
          The junior suite consisted of a small sitting room, a bathroom, and 
          large bedroom. We separated long enough for me to strip down to my boxers. 
          Melody kicked off her heels and through her pink jacket and skirt on 
          the couch. We went into the bedroom wearing nothing but our underwear. 
          The curtains were open displaying a decent view of the midtown area, 
          but neither of us noticed. Melody opened her purse, pulled out an unopened 
          box of Trojans, and tossed them on the nightstand. Apparently she had 
          come prepared. <p>
          &quot;I've been wishing this would happen for weeks,&quot; she said 
          seductively. She placed her hand on my bare chest and directed me towards 
          the kind sized bed.<p>
          &quot;Well, be careful what you wish for,&quot; I responded. <p>
          &quot;I'm going to wear you out.&quot;<p>
          &quot;I hope that's a promise,&quot; she said. I directed me to take 
          a seat on the edge of the bed. I couldn't believe how sexy she looked 
          in her sheer bra, stockings, and lacy white half slip. She dropped to 
          her knees in front of me and slowly tugged at my boxers. &quot;You know,&quot; 
          she said with a smile, &quot;I haven't had sex since my divorce.&quot; 
          My underwear slid off, exposing my throbbing eight inches of cock.. 
          She kissed the tip of it. &quot;And before that,&quot; she continued, 
          &quot;It had been almost six miserable months since I fucked my asshole 
          ex.&quot; She wrapped her hands around the base of my dick and stroked 
          it slowly, using my pre-cum as lubrication. &quot;That's eight months 
          total,&quot; she said, &quot;since I've been fucked.&quot; She slip 
          her tongue along my shaft. &quot;Eight months, since I've even seen 
          a dick.&quot; She kissed the tip again. &quot;Eight months of having 
          to satisfy my urges by myself, and I have a LOT of urges.&quot; She 
          started to squeeze my cock firmly. It felt amazing. &quot;I'm tired 
          of replacing the batteries in my vibrator. I want you to fuck me like 
          an animal,&quot; she said. &quot;I've seen you eyeing me in meetings, 
          checking me out. It kind of repulsed me at first, but it hasn't lately. 
          I've been dreaming about being fucked by a young stud. I've been dreaming 
          about you using me like your slut.&quot;<p>
          She was jerking my cock fiercely now, pushing me to the edge of release, 
          then slowing down again. &quot;Use me like your slut,&quot; she said. 
          &quot;I need some no strings sex. I need to put all the bad years behind 
          me. Six years of marriage, and 3 years of dating. Nine years of sex 
          with the same person. Nine years of his flabby body, and his stubby 
          cock. It was nothing like yours. I want to feel that beautiful cock 
          inside me.&quot;<p>
          I couldn't believe the things she was saying. I had never expected her 
          to have such a wild side. Melody's words were inflating my ego, and 
          finally I couldn't take it anymore. I grabbed her shoulders and pulled 
          her into the bed. I unhooked the clasp on her bra, exposing her perky 
          little tits. I sucked on each of them as Melody sheathed my cock. I 
          reached beneath her slip and pulled off her little leopard print bikinis, 
          and then I rolled her onto her back and mounted her. I spread her legs 
          and placed them over my shoulders, forcing the little half slip up and 
          exposing her pubic hair. &quot;Are you ready?&quot; I asked.<p>
          &quot;Make me your slut,&quot; she said. With her legs draped over my 
          back, I forced the swollen head of my cock inside her pussy. We both 
          gasped as I buried my shaft deep inside her. Then I leaned forward and 
          started fucking her. &quot;Oh shit,&quot; Melody squealed. &quot;Fuck 
          me harder. I like it hard.&quot;<p>
          She started clawing at my bare back with her fingernails as I drove 
          harder. Melody started to scream and grunt. The sloshing sound of me 
          rhythmically pumping myself into her cunt filled the room. I started 
          to push harder, and the headboard joined the rhythm, thumping off the 
          wall with each thrust. She continued to squeal out expletives as I increased 
          the pace, slamming my dick deep inside her with each stroke. Her screams 
          reached a fevered pitch. &quot;Oh, I'm cumming,&quot; she suddenly squealed. 
          She buried her nails into my back and closed her eyes as her body contorted 
          out of control.<p>
          She laid there trying to catch her breath as I pulled my cock out. &quot;That 
          was incredible,&quot; she panted. &quot;I haven't been fucked like that 
          since the third year of my marriage.&quot; She was still gasping for 
          air. &quot;I used to LOVE it rough,&quot; she said emphatically. <p>
          &quot;We're not through yet,&quot; I said. Melody looked up and noticed 
          my still erect cock.<p>
          &quot;Shit!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I thought you came. My husband-I 
          mean ex-husband-would be finished for the night after that. Hell, probably 
          for the week.&quot;<p>
          I paid little attention to what she was saying as I rolled her over 
          onto her stomach. She was still wearing her stocking and slip skirt. 
          It made her lean, sweat covered body look even sexier. I'd slept with 
          older women before, but none of them had been as fit and muscular as 
          Melody. She didn't have large breast or seductive curves, but everything 
          she did have was incredibly tight and well sculpted. I lifted her hips 
          slightly, coaxing her onto her hands and knees. I got behind her and 
          ran the head of my swollen cock over her slip covered ass. It was unbelievably 
          smooth and sexy. I slipped a hand between her legs and started rubbing 
          her pussy. The whole area was soaked. Her inner thighs were coated with 
          her juices, and some had run down the crack of her butt. I had just 
          wanted to fuck her doggie style, but now I had a change of plan. <p>
          &quot;So you like it rough?&quot; I asked. I was lifting her little 
          skirt with one hand and fondling her clit with the other.<p>
          She looked over her shoulder and smiled. &quot;Yes,&quot; she said. 
          &quot;Give it to me rough again. Fill me up.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Turn around and grab the headboard,&quot; I said. <p>
          &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; she said mockingly. She faced forward and placed 
          to hands on the headboard. Her back was perfectly arched with her ass 
          sticking up into the air. As quietly as possibly I took off the condom 
          and through it on the floor. I dipped my fingers into her pussy and 
          then coated by dick with the juices. I took the engorged head of my 
          penis and pressed it against her tight little asshole. <p>
          She jerked her head around. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; she asked 
          frantically. <p>
          &quot;Turn around,&quot; I almost shouted. Melody was so surprised by 
          the sudden outburst that she obeyed without thinking. <p>
          &quot;But&#133;but&#133;I've never done this,&quot; she said. For the 
          first time in the evening she felt like she had lost control. <p>
          &quot;Trust me,&quot; I said gruffly, &quot;a slut like you will like 
          it.&quot; I think I was surprising myself more than my date. I was normally 
          a very mild-mannered, considerate person-both in and out of the bedroom. 
          But I had always harbored contradicting feelings of contempt and lust 
          for Melody. It was a very strange combination, and now both emotions 
          were surfacing at the same time. I was aching to fuck her, but I had 
          very little respect for her, and I wasn't happy with myself for giving 
          in to lust so easily. It's like I needed to create a new, meaner version 
          of myself, because the normal version would have nothing to do with 
          these activities.<p>
          I started sliding the swollen head of me penis into her tiny asshole. 
          It was incredibly tight, and as I slowly forced my way in Melody let 
          loose a strange whining sound. I had to concentrate to keep from blowing 
          my load right away. I slowly worked my big cock all the way into her 
          tight little opening. She continued to whimper and gasp for air, but 
          she was pushing back at the same time, helping me get all the way in. 
          <p>
          &quot;How does it feel?&quot; I asked softly. My voice was more mellow 
          now, more like my normal self. <p>
          &quot;I feel so full,&quot; she said in an almost inaudible whisper. 
          &quot;I feel so full,&quot; she repeated. <p>
          I gently slid my cock back out. When I started my in-thrust, Melody 
          forced her hips back again, taking me inside her. &quot;Mmm,&quot; she 
          moaned. I leaned forward, draping my body over hers. With one hand, 
          I started to rub her clit and finger her pussy. I reached up with the 
          other and grabbed one of her small tits. I twisted and teased the nipple 
          as I started to fuck her ass earnestly. <p>
          Melody's groans hinted at a mix of pain and desire. She bucked her hips 
          back hard, increasing the momentum as I slid my cock in and out. &quot;Oh 
          yeah,&quot; she started to groan. &quot;Fill me up!&quot; I pulled hard 
          on her nipple and she squealed in delight. Her body started moving smoothly. 
          She gyrated her hips in time with my thrusting, causing my balls to 
          slap against her ass. At the same time I continued to sink two fingers 
          into her pussy. I could feel them against my dick as I filled up her 
          two holes. Melody's breath was reaching a fevered pitch, and her squeals 
          went up an octave. This time, when her body started contorting I was 
          ready to cum with her. As she trembled from her orgasm I unloaded gob 
          after gob of hot semen into her tight little asshole. The two of us 
          climaxed together, and continued to fuck all the way through our orgasms. 
          When everything had finally stopped, I pulled out and the two of us 
          collapsed into the sheets. Melody wrapped her arms around my naked body, 
          but we didn't really kiss or cuddle. We exchanged pleasantries and meaningless 
          comments for the next few minute before turning off the lights to get 
          some rest.</p>
        <p><p>
          Sleep didn't come easy for me. Melody drifted off almost immediately. 
          She wore an expression of tranquility, and it seemed as if some great 
          burden had been lifted off her shoulder. She looked serene and beautiful. 
          As I watched her sleep peacefully I felt a little guilty, although I 
          wasn't sure why. I was pretty convinced that she had just been using 
          me for sex.<p>
          I laid tossing and turning between the sheets, trying desperately to 
          get some rest. My mind kept drifting back to the events of the weekend. 
          Melody's asking me to take her to the party had been unexpected. Her 
          invitation to join her in a sex romp had been even more unexpected. 
          But I was starting to understand her reasons. The person I couldn't 
          understand was Aimee. What had transpired between us, and why? Finally, 
          I gave up my futile attempt at rest and got out of bed. I was inexplicably 
          craving a cigarette for the second time that day. After a moment's debate 
          I decided to go down to the lobby and look for a machine. <p>
          I slipped on my boxers and found a terry cloth robe in the bathroom. 
          I walked over to Melody, meaning to tell her where I was going in case 
          she woke up. The sheets had slid down, and her nude body was exposed. 
          One look at those perky tits was enough to make my cock start stirring. 
          I decided if I woke her we would just end up fucking again, so I just 
          wrote a note on the hotel stationary and sat it on the nightstand. I 
          glanced at the clock and realized it was only 1:30, and that there would 
          probably still be a lot of people in the lobby, maybe even some leftover 
          partiers from work. I hung the robe back in the bathroom and put on 
          my clothes, then I took the room key and left. <p>
          Even before I got to the lobby I knew my search would be fruitless. 
          Upscale hotels generally don't litter their ornate lobbies with tobacco 
          vending machines. Still, it would hurt to look around. I figured I may 
          be able to bum a smoke off the night clerk or one of the bell hops.<p>
          I roamed around the first floor of the hotel for several minutes looking 
          for the machine that I knew wouldn't exist. I eventually gave up and 
          started back towards the main lobby. That's when I saw Aimee. She was 
          sitting in a plush chair just past the hallway that led to the grandiose 
          ballroom where we had spent the evening. During my cigarette foraging 
          I had seen a few people I recognized from work still loitering about 
          the hotel. I had given a token nod to the people who recognized me and 
          ignored the rest, but my reaction to Aimee was different. The instant 
          I recognized her my heart started pounding in my chest. Part of my brain 
          urged me to run, although I didn't know why. Fortunately, the logical 
          half of my brain prevailed and I walked over to her.<p>
          &quot;Hey,&quot; I said. &quot;I didn't know you guys were still here.&quot;<p>
          She looked up at me and offered a nervous smile. &quot;Well,&quot; she 
          began quietly, &quot;It's not really 'still here'. More like 'back here'. 
          And it's not really 'you guys'. It's just me. I came back by myself.&quot;<p>
          For the first time I noticed that she was dressed differently. Her light 
          brown hair was now pulled back in it's customary pony tail. She was 
          wearing the same short gray skirt, but the suggestive red halter had 
          been replaced by a white button down shirt that wasn't tucked in, and 
          a pink cardigan. She looked more like the cute, somewhat conservative 
          Aimee that I had know for years instead of the seductress from the dance 
          floor. Her eyes looked a little red, as if she had been crying, or at 
          least rubbing them a lot. <p>
          &quot;I don't understand,&quot; I said. &quot;What's going on, Aimee?&quot;<p>
          &quot;We need to talk,&quot; she said nervously. &quot;I think we need 
          to talk about what happened. I saw you and Melody earlier. We walked 
          right by you waiting for the elevator. I don't think you noticed. You 
          were&#133;busy.&quot; I recalled how Melody and I had been kissing and 
          fondling each other as we waited on the elevator. The president could 
          have walked by and I wouldn't have noticed. &quot;Anyway, I knew you'd 
          still be here, so I got your pager number from the company directory, 
          and I've been sitting down here for 45 minutes debating with myself 
          whether I should use it or not.&quot;<p>
          I nodded slowly as I took in what she was saying. I kept flashing back 
          to our 15 minutes on the dance floor. I recalled the way her warm body 
          felt pressed against mine, and how soft her lips had been as they touched 
          my own. I fought back an urge to sweep her up in my arms and kiss her 
          again, consequences be damned. &quot;Why don't we go for a walk?&quot; 
          I said finally.<p>
          &quot;What about your date?&quot; she asked. She said the word &quot;date&quot; 
          in a very condescending tone. <p>
          &quot;You don't worry about her,&quot; I said. &quot;I'll take care 
          of that when I get back. Besides, I think she was just using me anyway.&quot; 
          Aimee cocked her eye curiously. &quot;I didn't realize it right away, 
          but I think she just asked me out for sex. I know it sounds weird, but 
          she had an unopened box of rubbers in her purse, and it's not as if 
          she made an effort to get to know me before we fucked.&quot;<p>
          &quot;I don't need any more details,&quot; she said suddenly. She looked 
          a little upset and confused as she stood up. I took her arm and we walked 
          out the front door into the chilly December air. <p>
          &quot;So what happened to your date-I mean fianc&eacute;?&quot; I asked.<p>
          &quot;It's a long story,&quot; she responded.<p>
          &quot;We've got plenty of time.&quot;<p>
          &quot;I guess I should start at the beginning,&quot; she said. I agreed 
          with her. &quot;After we, er, after you and I kissed, I was so confused. 
          I was angry at you for doing it, but I was angrier at myself for asking 
          for it. I kept thinking what a horrible person I was, but at the same 
          time I wanted to do it again. I wanted to forget about everything else 
          in the world, including Gregory, and just be back in your arms again. 
          Part of me wanted to slap you, and part of me wanted to run away, but 
          I think mostly I just wanted to keep dancing with you. And then Gregory 
          was there, and I was swept away, and we were dancing, and I was just 
          pretending nothing had happened. I just kept telling myself that it 
          was no big deal and that I had just gotten caught up in the moment. 
          <p>
          &quot;So we danced, and I hid my feelings for the most part. But then 
          I kept wondering if maybe it had meant something. Then we decided to 
          leave and that's when I saw you and that tramp by the elevator. My blood 
          started to boil. I wanted to yank you apart. I wanted to kick her ass. 
          I felt so used. I felt like you had seen me as just someone to try and 
          score with.&quot;<p>
          &quot;That's not true,&quot; I butted in. We were now wandering aimlessly 
          down a well lit street. It was still too early to worry about getting 
          mugged, and we were in a fairly nice part of the city. <p>
          &quot;Just let me finish,&quot; Aimee said. &quot;Then we can<p>
          discuss it. Anyway, so I was angry and confused, and<p>
          I was still trying to hide all of the this from<p>
          Gregory. Most of all, I just kept wondering how I<p>
          could have been so mistaken, and how I could have felt<p>
          anything for you. I was pissed off at myself because<p>
          I knew I had felt something on the dance floor, and I<p>
          you were just using me.&quot; I noticed that as she got<p>
          excited, her Pennsylvania accent became more<p>
          pronounced and her gestures became more animated<p>
          &quot;So when Gregory and I got to the car, all I could think of was 
          getting back at you. I know it's silly, but I though somehow I could 
          hurt you by fooling around with him-as if you would even know, or care. 
          So the minute we left the parking garage I was all over him. I was leaning 
          over the console, practically in his lap. I was rubbing his cock, making 
          him hard, talking dirty. I kept telling him how wild it was going to 
          be. I was talking filthy to him, and it's never been like that between 
          us.&quot; Now it was me who didn't want to hear the details, but I remained 
          silent while she talked. <p>
          &quot;We were driving over by Piedmont Park, and you know there aren't 
          many lights there, so I even untied that halter top I was wearing and 
          let it drop down. I didn't have a bra on.&quot; Although I didn't want 
          to, I couldn't help picturing the scene. I tried to picture those soft 
          breasts that she had crushed against earlier in the evening. I knew 
          they would be nicely shaped, and I imagined small pink nipples. I imagined 
          Gregory driving home with is his dick out, looking at Aimee topless. 
          I pictured him naked, fondling her breasts and rubbing her crotch. I 
          pictured them fucking, and her loving every minute of it. I couldn't 
          stop myself, and suddenly I was filled with jealousy. <p>
          &quot;Aimee, I really don't need the details,&quot; I said.<p>
          &quot;Oh&#133;I'm sorry,&quot; she responded. &quot;I just got carried 
          away reliving it all. Anyway, my point is that I got him all hot and 
          turned on, and when we got back to my apartment he was all over me, 
          and I was overwhelmed with nausea. That's a harsh word, but that's what 
          it felt like. I didn't want him touching me. I couldn't stop thinking 
          about you. I had to ask him to leave. Of course, that was followed by 
          a big fight, and finally he left. Then I just sat here in the dark, 
          wondering what was wrong with me. I was engaged to him, yet I had kissed 
          you, and I couldn't get you out of my mind. I kept thinking that maybe 
          it was just some fear of commitment thing, but then I would change my 
          mind and think I really felt something for you. I was so confused that 
          I just sat there and cried for a while. That's when I decided to come 
          back here and page you, because I just felt like we needed to talk. 
          I needed to understand what happened. I needed to know how you felt 
          about it. But then I got here, and I couldn't bring myself to page you, 
          so I just sat down here, and that's where you found me.<p>
          &quot;So,&quot; she said. &quot;That's my story.&quot; I looked over 
          and there were a couple of tears running down her cheek. I impulsively 
          reached out and put my arm around Aimee, pulling her close to my body. 
          With one finger I touched the tears on her pretty face and wiped them 
          away.<p>
          &quot;Am I crazy?&quot; she asked. &quot;I'm engaged to be married. 
          <p>
          This sort of thing should not be happening.&quot;<p>
          &quot;You're not crazy,&quot; I said.<p>
          &quot;I know you went upstairs with that woman,&quot; she began, &quot;but 
          I'm not wrong am I? You felt something when we were dancing. And when 
          we kissed. You weren't just lusting after me, or taking advantage of 
          me, were you?&quot;<p>
          &quot;No,&quot; I said. &quot;You aren't wrong. I felt something, too. 
          Lust is what happened between Melody and I. That's what you saw by the 
          elevator. I don't know why I went upstairs with her. I certainly don't 
          have any feelings for her. I was just frustrated because you disappeared 
          so quickly, and she was there. She was more than willing to pay attention 
          to me and no one else.&quot;<p>
          &quot;That's not fair,&quot; Aimee said.<p>
          &quot;I'm not accusing you of doing anything wrong,&quot; I responded. 
          &quot;That's just what happened. I was aroused by you, and I wanted 
          to be with you, but I didn't have that chance, so I went with her. You 
          have to know that I was thinking the same way you were. I thought maybe 
          the kiss was just something that had happened and meant nothing to you. 
          Especially since we didn't get a chance to talk afterwards.&quot;<p>
          &quot;This isn't fair,&quot; she pouted. &quot;Why did this have to 
          happen. I'm so confused. I don't know why I asked you to dance. I've 
          always been weak around you.&quot;<p>
          &quot;What does that mean?&quot; I asked.<p>
          &quot;You know what I mean,&quot; she responded. &quot;You know I've 
          always had a silly little crush on you.&quot;<p>
          I stopped walking. My arm was still around Aimee, so she stopped with 
          me. &quot;No, I didn't know that,&quot; I said.<p>
          &quot;Don't bullshit me,&quot; she said. &quot;How could you not have?&quot; 
          She looked up and saw the genuine astonishment on my face. &quot;Oh 
          shit!&quot; she said. &quot;You really didn't know! How could you not 
          have? I thought it was so obvious from the first time I met you. Hell, 
          you were the deciding factor in the college I went to.&quot;<p>
          &quot;And is that why you took your job?&quot;<p>
          &quot;Don't flatter yourself that much,&quot; she giggled. &quot;I took 
          the job because it was a great offer, but there was a little part of 
          me that felt maybe it was fate or destiny. But when I met Gregory, I 
          realized I was just being childish and put it all behind me. Until tonight 
          anyway. I knew you weren't interested in me that way. Nothing even happened 
          between us that night I passed out in your room during my freshman year.&quot;<p>
          That night came rushing back to me as soon as she mentioned it. Saying 
          &quot;nothing even happened&quot; wasn't the exact truth. That's what 
          I had told Aimee the next morning to save her dignity. Now, as we approached 
          Centennial Park I felt compelled to tell her the truth, to let her know 
          how wrong she was about me not being attracted to her. We took a seat 
          on a park bench as I recollected the story.</p>
        <p><p>
          It was half way through the fall semester and our fraternity had just 
          thrown a raucous party in celebration of out football team upsetting 
          a conference rival. I hadn't brought a date to the party and had spent 
          most of my evening worrying more about consuming alcohol then meeting 
          girls. I was just climbing into bed when I heard the knock on the door.<p>
          I opened it so find Aimee leaning against the frame, too drunk to stand 
          on her own power. &quot;Can I stay here?&quot; she pleaded. &quot;If 
          I stay with Zack I'm afraid something will happen, and I can't go back 
          to the dorm this drunk.&quot;<p>
          I opened the door and let Aimee in. Zack was a fraternity brother that 
          she had been on a few dates with, including that nights football game. 
          Apparently he had been trying to advance their relationship to a sexual 
          level and she wasn't ready yet. Even in her drunken state I noticed 
          that Aimee looked cute. Her brown hair was pulled back in a messy pony 
          tail. She was wearing a dark blue silk button down and a short black 
          skirt. It was a little flashier than she had been in high school, but 
          I guessed she was trying to change her look a bit. She threw an arm 
          around my shoulder and I helped her to the couch. <p>
          &quot;I don't want to stay with Zack because he wants to fuck,&quot; 
          she slurred. I was shocked by the audaciousness of her statement, but 
          it also struck me as funny. I couldn't help giggling.<p>
          &quot;That's nice,&quot; I said. I had already learned that it was best 
          to just smile and nod when a drunk person is talking.<p>
          &quot;I don't want to fuck him,&quot; she stuttered.<p>
          &quot;That's great, Aimee. Maybe you should keep this to yourself.&quot; 
          I stated.<p>
          &quot;You know why?&quot; she asked.<p>
          &quot;It's none of my business,&quot; I said.<p>
          &quot;Because I'm a virgin,&quot; she slurred. She put a finger to her 
          lips. &quot;Shhhh! It's a secret.&quot;<p>
          I was a bit surprised by her statement and didn't know what to say.<p>
          She gazed over at me with her big brown eyes. &quot;Did I shock you?&quot; 
          I just nodded. &quot;Well, I just haven't found the right guy,&quot; 
          she said solemnly. &quot;Maybe you're him.&quot;<p>
          She leaned over and started nibbling at my ear. Her hand found it's 
          way to my crotch. She rubbed up and down my cock. It was obvious she 
          wasn't familiar with what she was doing, but I was getting aroused none 
          the less.<p>
          &quot;We should stop this&#133;.&quot; I began.<p>
          Aimee seemed not to hear as she clumsily slung one leg over mine and 
          moved to straddle me. Her skirt rode all the way up, revealing a pair 
          of simple black panties. &quot;Don't you want to fuck me?&quot; she 
          blurted out. &quot;Don't you want to pop my cherry?&quot;<p>
          My mind was screaming &quot;no&quot; but my hands didn't listen. I quickly 
          managed to open her blouse. Her bra was also black and simple and her 
          hard little nipples protruded through the fabric. I unzipped my fly 
          and ripped out my swollen penis. I placed it in her hand.</p>
        <p>&quot;You want me to suck on that?&quot; she said with a silly smile.<p>
          I nodded, and Aimee slowly started sliding down my body. The alcohol 
          had robbed her of her gracefulness and she ended up falling off my lap 
          onto the floor. The clumsy moment was enough to break the spell she 
          had over me and I realized what was going on. I quickly stood up and 
          zipped my fly. <p>
          &quot;We can't do this,&quot; I reiterated. &quot;You're drunk. You 
          don't know what you're doing.&quot;<p>
          Aimee started protesting and became a bit irate. I turned off the lights 
          and laid down in my bed. For the next ten minutes Aimee continued to 
          complain and rub her body against me, begging me to fuck her. Somehow, 
          I managed to resist. Eventually she passed out, then I moved to the 
          couch, masturbated, and went to sleep.<p>
          The next morning I was planning to ask Aimee out on a date, but she 
          had no memory of the previous night and I didn't have the heart to tell 
          her what had happened. So she assumed the night had been uneventful 
          and ended up going back to Zack. I held out for several months hoping 
          that they would break up, but by the time they finally had I was in 
          another relationship. It was that way for the rest of college. Every 
          time one of us was single, the other was in a relationship.</p>
        <p>Aimee sat mesmerized on the park bench as I finished telling the story. 
          &quot;I can't believe that happened and that I don't remember any of 
          it,&quot; she said. &quot;You were such a gentlemen. So for all those 
          years in school were you really wanting to date me?&quot;<p>
          &quot;Not when I was with someone else,&quot; I said. &quot;But every 
          time my relationships ended, you're the first person I thought of.&quot;<p>
          &quot;I never knew,&quot; she said. &quot;If I had, we may have ended 
          up together at some point.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Maybe,&quot; I said.<p>
          &quot;You know,&quot; she began, &quot;I never did sleep with Zack. 
          We went out for four months and he never got past fondling.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Yeah,&quot; I said, &quot;But something tells me you're not a 
          virgin now.&quot; <p>
          &quot;No,&quot; she said with a giggle. &quot;Now I'm a regular sex 
          goddess. You'd be amazed.&quot;<p>
          &quot;I'm sure I would,&quot; I responded. &quot;I'm constantly amazed 
          by you now.&quot;<p>
          Aimee didn't know how to respond. She just stared up at me. Suddenly 
          the tension was too much for either of us to bare. Our lips drew together 
          like magnets, and I kissed her softly. It was open-lipped and moist 
          and our tongues met. I wrapped my arms around Aimee and pulled her tight 
          against me. We stayed in that position for several moments before we 
          were unexpectedly pelted with cold drops of rain. <p>
          She pulled away suddenly and looked up as the sky seemed to open and 
          a downpour ensued. We both sat stunned in the cold rain before Aimee 
          finally reacted. She grabbed my hand and pulled me up from the bench. 
          <p>
          &quot;Come on,&quot; she called out. &quot;I live right over there. 
          <p>
          We have to get out of this mess.&quot;<p>
          She pulled me towards a tall building that I thought housed offices. 
          Apparently it had been renovated and made into luxury downtown condominiums. 
          She led me to her place on the third floor. The living room was dominated 
          by a big bay window which allowed a partial view of the park. I stood 
          admiring the view as Aimee turned on the lights.<p>
          &quot;What just happened?&quot; she asked finally. <p>
          I turned just in time to see her removing her soaked sweater. Her hair 
          was also drenched and falling out of it's pony tail. Her white blouse 
          had become transparent and was clinging to her curves. I could easily 
          make out her lacy lavender bra. She looked extremely sexy.<p>
          &quot;I don't know,&quot; I said. &quot;It was a sudden downpour.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Not that,&quot; she responded. &quot;Before hand. Between us.&quot;<p>
          I was tired of being timid and I felt the need to take control of the 
          situation. I stepped towards Aimee and cupped her face in my hands. 
          &quot;This is what happened,&quot; I said. Then I leaned forward and 
          kissed her firmly and passionately. For a second she resisted, but I 
          felt her body eventually cave in and melt with my own. We were both 
          shivering from the cold rain as we embraced and began to smother each 
          other with kisses. Our bodies seemed to be heating up. <p>
          I took a step back and gazed at her intently. &quot;Aimee,&quot; I started, 
          &quot;I know this is a difficult situation to put you in, so if you 
          say the word I'll leave right now. I won't argue or try to change your 
          mind. Just let me know what you want.&quot;<p>
          Aimee gazed into my brown eyes with her own. With her right hand, she 
          slid the diamond off of her left ring finger and placed it on the table 
          in her small dining room. &quot;I want you to get out of these wet clothes,&quot; 
          she said seductively. <p>
          In a matter of seconds I had peeled off all my clothing and left it 
          on the floor. My penis was rock hard and standing in front of like a 
          divining rod. &quot;Now what do you want?&quot; I asked.<p>
          &quot;I want to finish what I started a few years ago.&quot; Aimee kicked 
          of her shoes and started walking towards me. It was as if the rain had 
          transformed the innocent girl I had known for years into a wanton harlot. 
          She swung her hips seductively as she approached. Her wet hair dangled 
          provocatively around her pretty face. Her damp clothes clung to her 
          body, outlining each of her subtle curves. She place a hand on my chest 
          and started pushing me backwards towards the large blue sofa. <p>
          I took a seat and Aimee straddled me. For a moment we just stared at 
          one another, each lost in the other's eyes. Then she leaned forward, 
          cocked her head, and pressed her lips to mine. The kiss was soft, wet, 
          and passionate. It was very intense without seeming needy or lust-driven. 
          Instinctively I put my arms around her and began grinding my crotch 
          into her own. <p>
          Aimee sat up and gently kissed the tip of my nose and then the center 
          of my forehead. She slowly started sliding down my body. She moved slowly 
          and gracefully. &quot;Where are you going?&quot; I asked.<p>
          She wrapped a small hand around my swollen organ. &quot;Right here,&quot; 
          she whispered. She kissed the tip of it with her soft ruby lips.<p>
          &quot;Not now,&quot; I pleaded. &quot;I want your body close to mine. 
          I want to be face to face with you.&quot;<p>
          Aimee seemed genuinely moved by my sincere statement. &quot;That's so 
          sweet,&quot; she whispered. She stood back up and straddled me once 
          again. I guided her head to my shoulder, then turned and softly tasted 
          her lips. We were both still shivering, but now it was from anticipation 
          instead of the cold. Aimee slipped a hand between our bodies and began 
          rubbing my erect dick. I reached under her skirt and tugged at the waistband 
          of her panties. She sat up enough for me to slide them down, then she 
          stood up so I could remove the lace-covered lavender garment. <p>
          Aimee pushed her tight skirt up around her waist as she sat back down. 
          Her pussy was covered with thin wisps of brownish hair. I lined my cock 
          up at her entrance and pushed my way into her velvety folds. We both 
          gasped as she put her full wait forward, taking my eight inches deep 
          inside. <p>
          &quot;I've dreamt about this for years,&quot; I whispered. <p>
          &quot;Me too,&quot; she said. <p>
          She started rocking back and forth, letting my penis slide in and out 
          of her hot cunt. We moved slow and rhythmically at first, getting a 
          feel for one another. We seemed magically linked to one another. With 
          each stroke, the tempo increased. We whispered complements in each others 
          ears in between passionate kisses. I started opening the buttons on 
          her blouse, but it was too difficult, and finally I just tore it open, 
          sending buttons flying across the room. I opened the front clasp on 
          her lavender bra. Her B-cup breasts spilled out. Her small nipples were 
          hard and a darker shade of pink then I had imagined. I took one in my 
          mouth as I continued to force my shaft up and inside my lover.<p>
          Aimee was starting to lose control now. She bounced on my cock fiercely, 
          slamming me into the depths of her vagina. Her titties bounces around 
          frantically with her up and down motion. I was hypnotized by their motion. 
          <p>
          &quot;I'm about to cum,&quot; she moaned, and suddenly I felt the exact 
          same way. I grabbed Aimee's hips and used the leverage to force myself 
          deeper inside her. She screamed with delight as we started fucking at 
          an unbelievable pace. &quot;Don't stop,&quot; she panted. I had no intention 
          of letting her down.<p>
          I slipped my hand beneath her smooth thighs and in one quick motion 
          I stood up and lifter her with me. Aimee wrapped her legs tight around 
          my back. My shaft was still deep inside her pussy. I carried her to 
          the dining room table. I sat Aimee on its edge. The reached behind her 
          and swept off the contents of the table-a small vase with a few flowers, 
          and the engagement ring she had been wearing earlier in the evening. 
          The vase hit the floor and broke, but neither of us noticed. <p>
          Aimee laid on her back with her legs spread wide and I mounted her. 
          I felt her nails buried in my back as I started driving intensely. We 
          both started grunting like animals and we approached our peaks. Aimee 
          went first. She called out my name as wave after wave of delight washed 
          through her body. &quot;Oh, YES!&quot; she gasped. <p>
          Before she was finished I felt myself erupting. My balls seized up and 
          I started shooting my hot semen deep inside her slit. My orgasm seemed 
          to last forever. Finally, I rolled off and tried to catch my breath. 
          Aimee laid next to me for only a moment before sitting up and climbing 
          down from the table. I watched as she slid off her blouse, bra, and 
          skirt. <p>
          Her body was marvelous. I always knew she was trim, but I couldn't believe 
          what an excellent figure she had been hiding beneath her conservative 
          outfits for years. Her hips were curvy and sensuous. Her tits were smallish, 
          but ample. Her thighs were lean and muscular. She leaned forward and 
          put a hand on either side of my waist. Using the table to support her, 
          she bent her head and started kissing my dick. It responded almost immediately, 
          returning to its formerly hard state in record time. <p>
          As it began to reach its former glory, Aimee took the head into her 
          mouth and started swirling her tongue around it. She sucked it firmly 
          and my whole body was covered in chill bumps. Aimee released my cock 
          and smiled. &quot;I think I'm going to the bed room,&quot; she said. 
          &quot;Care to join me?&quot;<p>
          I sat up and watched the nude girl stroll down a short hallway and into 
          the bedroom. I quickly followed, with my arrow like erection leading 
          the way. I entered the room and found Aimee laying on her back in bed. 
          She was tweaking each of her nipples with her hands. She was right at 
          the edge with her legs spread wide and dangling over the side of the 
          bed. I knew exactly what she wanted.<p>
          I moved closer and dropped to my knees. Already I could smell her musky 
          scent luring me in. It was dark, but I could still see the outline of 
          her swollen clitoris. I leaned forward and took it in my mouth. Aimee 
          moaned like a hooker as I started sucking her most sensitive spot. I 
          took a thumb and started tracing the outline of her vagina. The forefinger 
          of the same hand started probing her asshole. <p>
          &quot;Oh shit,&quot; she moaned as I slowly finger-fucked both holes. 
          I was flicking her clit rapidly with my tongue, then sucking on it firmly 
          with my lips. Aimee started moving her body in rhythm, rubbing her pussy 
          in my face as she let my fingers slide in and out of her pussy and ass. 
          In a matter of seconds she went from tranquil to wild. She bucked about 
          frantically and I slipped a second finger into her asshole and corkscrewed 
          both of them around. Aimee sat up and squealed. She wrapped her hand 
          tight around my head, pushing my face into her cunt, letting me lap 
          her juices as she orgasmed. <p>
          Her orgasm finally subsided, but it was obvious she wasn't satisfied. 
          &quot;Fuck me now,&quot; Aimee pleaded. I was barely between the cool 
          white sheets before she had grabbed me and forced me onto my back. Once 
          again, Aimee straddled me. Her pussy made a wet, sloppy sound as she 
          impaled herself on my dick. She placed both hands on my chest and leaned 
          forward, using her weight to pin me down. Then she started bouncing 
          on my dick, riding me like an animal. I wanted desperately to roll her 
          on her back but she was able to squelch my resistance. Finally, I gave 
          up and just relaxed and enjoyed the sensation. Her brown hair and perky 
          tits were swinging out of control as she continued to ride me ragged. 
          <p>
          &quot;I'm gonna cum, I'm gonna cum,&quot; she started panting, but this 
          time I was ahead of her. I was overwhelmed by the sights, sounds and 
          sensations of fucking this girl I had pined over for years. My cock 
          erupted like a volcano, spewing my load up in her again. She started 
          milking my dick with her pussy, and then she started to join me in orgasm. 
          <p>
          &quot;Oh shit,&quot; she cried out as she enjoyed her moment of pleasure. 
          She continued humping me for several moments until every bit of pleasure 
          had passed through her. Then she collapsed on top of me to catch her 
          breath.<p>
          We laid there kissing for several minutes before moving to a spooning 
          position. I softly nibbled on Aimee's ear as she drifted off to sleep. 
          It took my longer to find rest. I kept gazing at her left hand; the 
          one which no long bore a diamond ring. I knew that we would both have 
          a lot to deal with come sunup, but finally I realized that as long as 
          were together, we would be able to deal with any hassle. That thought 
          put my mind at rest, and I gripped Aimee a little tighter and finally 
          found my way to sleep. <p>
