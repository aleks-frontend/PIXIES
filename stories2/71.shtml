              <p> Tossing and turning, Paige Barlow tried unsuccessfully to find 
                a comfortable sleeping position. She rolled over on her side, 
                only to see the dim red numbers on her bedside clock show that 
                it was now three thirty in the morning. She groaned and said out 
                loud, &quot;Good grief, I have to get up in just three hours, 
                I just gotta get some sleep!&quot; In another fifteen minutes 
                or so, sleep over took her tired body, but it was far from fitful 
                as she tossed and turned, slipping in and out of unconsciousness, 
                caught in that nether world between sleep and awake. As the clock 
                ticked towards five o'clock, something very strange began happening 
                to Paige's body!!! Her vagina became very wet, totally aroused 
                and ready for intercourse, and while she was vaguely aware that 
                something sexual was overtaking her, she was powerless to stop 
                it. Slowly her whole body was enveloped by this &quot;force&quot;, 
                this sexual presence that seemed to fill her very existence. She 
                trembled as it rushed through her, making every pore of he skin 
                seem like a mini vagina until she was exuding sexuality in a way 
                she had never felt before!!! Although not conscious, she was aware 
                of everything that happening to her, that feeling that her entire 
                being was a huge sex organ. Then it hit her, she felt something 
                or someone inside of her driving her to the most massive orgasm 
                she had ever felt in her young life! She screamed in ecstasy as 
                wave after wave of pleasure swept through her, ripping away her 
                modest mid western demeanor in the process, and then just as quickly 
                as it started, it was over! Limp as an old dish rag, with sweat 
                popping out all over her, she awoke, barley able to move, all 
                of her energy sapped by the mystical presence!!!<br>
                She fell back into a deep sleep, not even hearing the alarm clock's 
                loud buzz, as she slept straight through until noon. When she 
                finally came to, she struggled into the bathroom, getting under 
                a cold shower, trying to regain her senses. Still weak as a kitten, 
                she called the office and told them that she wouldn't be in due 
                to illness, and then went to the kitchen to get something to eat. 
                &quot;My god,&quot; she thought, &quot;what the hell happened 
                to me last night!&quot; Although her sex life wasn't exactly on 
                fire at the moment, she had enough orgasms through regular sex, 
                as well as masturbation, and while she had heard about wet dreams, 
                but she thought that that was a male thing, at least ways until 
                now, but there was no mistaking it, she had had an orgasm in her 
                sleep! &quot;Well,&quot; she opined to herself, &quot;no harm 
                in that I guess,&quot; and then commenced cleaning up her lunch 
                dishes until finally feeling more like herself, she went out and 
                ran a few errands, soon forgetting about her experience from the 
                night before. </p>
              <p>The next morning she was off to work early, knowing she had a 
                lot to make up because of yesterday's absence, so she hopped on 
                the bus and took a seat about halfway back from the driver. Still 
                a little tired, she kept nodding off, being jolted back awake 
                by the jerking motion of the bus and it was during one of the 
                moments when she was just about under, when it started happening 
                again. She could feel it in her vagina! Trying to stop it, she 
                struggled to open her eyes, but to no avail as it was almost like 
                seeing an accident in slow motion, you think you can stop it, 
                but it just seems to be a little out of your reach. Again her 
                whole being was being swept along by a mystical force, far more 
                powerful than she was capable of resisting. Her vagina was leaking 
                juice, making her crack drip onto her lace panties, making them 
                damp with the aroma of fresh sex. Her breathing became shallow 
                as her body responded to the excitement that coursed through her!!! 
                While she had never had any problem cumming, her body was now 
                an instrument of sexual desire! She could feel this tremendous 
                orgasm welling up inside of her, no human being had ever made 
                her feel so female! What ever was causing her to cum, was also 
                making her feel like the most sexually perfect woman on earth, 
                and at this very moment her mind and pussy were as one in the 
                universe! She felt like the mother of all beings, it was impossible 
                to describe, but she just knew that no other woman had ever been 
                as fulfilled as she was right now! Something was in her vagina, 
                making her lips and clitoris puff up like they had never done 
                before, she felt so sexual, so like a pussy. She was the ultimate 
                female, and she was being taken by an unknown force! Again, she 
                screamed when her vagina was rocked by the most intense orgasm 
                any female had ever experienced! When she finally opened her eyes, 
                thirty five other passengers were staring at her, wondering what 
                had caused this twenty five year old woman to have what appeared 
                to be an intense sexual episode on a crowded city bus!!! She would 
                have gotten off at the next stop, but as was the case yesterday 
                morning, she couldn't move a muscle, but thankfully by the time 
                the bus reached down town, she had just enough strength to wobble 
                to the exit door and make it to the street. She hoped she could 
                walk the remaining block to her office, but she really wasn't 
                sure that she could!!!</p>
              <p>When she finally plopped down in her chair, she was still feeling 
                the effects of her on bus orgasm and several of her coworkers 
                stopped by to see if she was okay. She merely nodded and told 
                them that she was still a little weak from the flu and that she 
                would be all right, while not believing those words even as she 
                spoke them! Twice in the last forty eight hours she had been racked 
                by the most vicious orgasms she could possibly imagine, both having 
                left her shaken and trembling, and while she had always had a 
                healthy attitude towards sex, there was something almost sinister 
                about what was happening to her. As good as it had felt, there 
                was an under current of malevolence surrounding the whole affair. 
                The main problem was what was causing it, and what if anything 
                could she do about it if she did find out what was going on! Paige 
                spent the rest of her day immersed in her work, trying not to 
                dwell on whether it would happen again, but the only thing she 
                was sure of so far, was that in both cases she had been sleeping 
                when she was over taken. &quot;Oh great,&quot; she thought, &quot;all 
                I have to do is never fall asleep again and everything will be 
                all right!&quot; At six pm sharp she left her office and headed 
                for the bus stop, anxious to get home and take a hot bath and 
                get to bed. She was mentally and physically fatigued, and her 
                usually sharp mind had been dulled by the past days events. While 
                standing by the bus stop, a rather odd thing occurred, that on 
                any other day would have meant nothing to her. An old woman, a 
                bag lady for lack of a nicer term, was approaching her on the 
                sidewalk pushing a shopping cart. In a city the size of Chicago, 
                this was not an uncommon event, so Paige hardly paid any attention 
                to her as she moved haltingly through the rush hour crowd. It 
                wasn't until she was almost on top of her that Paige realized 
                she was trying to make eye contact with her!!! When their eyes 
                met, they locked together, making a cold shiver run down her spine! 
                She tried to look away, but something held her in the gaze of 
                the old woman, a feeling she had previously felt during her two 
                episodes of the last two days. Closer and closer the old woman 
                came, causing Paige to feel that she might actually have a panic 
                attack right there on La Salle Street! When they were but inches 
                apart, the old woman whispered in a husky voice, &quot;You are 
                one of us now, in due course you will understand your place! Incubus!!!!&quot; 
                Just as quickly as she had appeared, the old woman was shuffling 
                off down the street, glancing back at Paige, again causing her 
                to shiver at the mere sight of the old woman's face. &quot;Incubus,&quot; 
                Paige thought, as she boarded her north bound bus, &quot;I've 
                never heard that word before, I wonder what it could mean?!?&quot; 
                &quot;Probably nothing,&quot; she reassured herself, &quot;she 
                was just an old woman, what the hell would she know!?!&quot;</p>
              <p>After a long hot soaking in the tub, Paige felt immeasurably 
                better. She ordered Chinese, watched a little TV, leafed through 
                a magazine, called her best friend Caitlin, and made plans for 
                a little shopping trip tomorrow afternoon. A relaxing weekend, 
                that's what she needed, and she was off to a good start! The droning 
                sound from the TV, along with a glass of wine too many, and before 
                she knew it, Paige was sound asleep on the sofa. Almost immediately 
                the same sinister force enveloped her! Her vagina, wet with sexual 
                desire, her breathing becoming shallow, her pulse quickening as 
                unbridled lust swept through her. She was only conscious that 
                it was happening again, the only difference being that she didn't 
                try to fight it, instinctively knowing it was hopeless to do so!!! 
                Again her body responded in a most female way, giving of herself 
                to the on rushing orgasm! This time, however, she sensed more 
                of a presence, of something making her feel like the mother of 
                all things! What was it, what could it be!?! Her vaginal walls 
                began to contract as the orgasm spread through her entire being, 
                until finally the climax ebbed, leaving Paige a disheveled sweaty 
                mess and her mind slowly clearing. There was no doubt about it 
                now, these orgasms came only when she was sleeping! What on earth 
                was the matter with her! My god, she just couldn't keep on this 
                way! The only odd thing that happened to her over the first few 
                days was her encounter with that bag lady. &quot;What was it she 
                said,&quot; thought Paige, &quot;incubus!?!&quot; &quot;What a 
                funny sounding word, I wonder if it even is a word!!!&quot; After 
                such a sexual explosion, Paige decided she needed another shower. 
                Her body was damp with sweat, and her vagina dripping wet from 
                the intense experience! After her shower, Page went to her dictionary 
                hoping to find the meaning of the word &quot;incubus&quot;, but 
                what she found frightened her, but her common sense told her it 
                was an impossibility! Her dictionary described an incubus as a 
                demon who has sexual relations with sleeping women, the resulting 
                offspring becoming witches, warlocks, or sorcerers. &quot;No way,&quot; 
                she spoke out loud, &quot;just fairy tales and folklore!!!&quot; 
                Even as she spoke, though, she had this terrible feeling that 
                what the old woman had said was true. How could she have possibly 
                known that Paige was having nocturnal orgasms? Why were these 
                orgasms so devastating? Why only when she was sleeping? So many 
                questions, so few answers, an now it was time for bed. Paige felt 
                a feeling of helplessness come over her. She was almost sure that 
                she would be assaulted again in her sleep, but her need for sleep 
                was overpowering as well. Slowly she climbed into bed, pulled 
                the covers up to her neck, and then waited. As usual, a person 
                doesn't even realize when they slip off to dreamland, and Paige 
                was no exception. She just drifted off, and was soon snoring quietly 
                in regular breaths. This time she felt &quot;him&quot; enter her 
                body through her vagina, instantly soaking her panties with secretions, 
                her whole body becoming inflamed with lust! This time it seemed 
                to be communicating directly with her, making it's presence overtly 
                known. It was as if it was telling her exactly what it was doing 
                to her, and that she was going to take it and like it! By now, 
                the fourth such occurrence, Page had become more accustomed to 
                the intense sexual excitement that she was feeling, and incredilby 
                it was now becoming almost like a drug for her, nothing else compared 
                to the feeling that the incubus could give her! She could feel 
                his demonic passion filling her up, and she finally gladly relented, 
                now almost begging &quot;him&quot; to take her as &quot;his&quot; 
                own! Her vagina shook as the pleasure built to unbelievable heights! 
                Her clitoris seemed to be as large as the universe, with the incubus 
                wrapping itself around it, driving her to even greater sexual 
                heights! When her orgasm erupted, her entire body was wracked 
                by the most incredible feeling on the face of the earth, at that 
                moment she knew she was &quot;his&quot;! This time he lingered 
                in her body, almost as if to say you are mine forever!</p>
              <p>When she was finally conscious, what the old woman had said to 
                her made perfect sense. She was one of them now, and the incubus 
                was her universe! She put her hands on her stomach and felt a 
                presence in her womb. Something was growing inside of her, she 
                wasn't sure what, but she lay down again, and fell into a deep 
                fitful sleep. If he entered her, that was fine, because she welcomed 
                him now, if not, she had his seed growing inside of her. Either 
                way, she was his, and would do his bidding forever!</p>
