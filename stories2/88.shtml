              <p> In 1815 Virgina, the rules were hard and fast, to be obeyed 
                without question, however, as we are about to see, not all rules 
                are applied with equality. What is good for the goose, is not 
                always good for the gander! John and Catherine Smith, a very religious 
                couple, had a small farm about three miles outside of Kirkville, 
                Virginia where they were raising their three children in the traditional 
                puritan upbringing. Rachel the oldest of the three, was the apple 
                of her father's eye, and the first of the Smith family to be born 
                in America!!! Both John and Catherine had high hopes that their 
                eldest daughter would marry and have a family of her own right 
                in Kirkville, and being a bright and very beautiful girl, Rachel 
                should have had her choice of any of the fine young Christian 
                men in the area, but alas, she seemed to show no interest in any 
                of them, and this confounded her parents no end, and no amount 
                of coaxing could persuade her to take up with any of the available 
                beau's. When ever her mother brought up the subject, it always 
                ended the same, with Rachel running to her room and slamming the 
                door, which effectively ended the conversation!<br>
                Having just turned eighteen, Rachel did have an interest in boys, 
                it was just that she wasn't interested in any of the ones her 
                parents deemed appropriate for her. She wouldn't have been caught 
                dead with any of them, and the thought of spending the rest of 
                her life with one of those dullards, well, it was enough to make 
                a body cringe!!! Rachel was a high spirited girl, and she was 
                attracted to like minded men, that is, those that seemed to have 
                a zest and love of life. The only one she had ever met that made 
                her tummy tie up in knots was Robert Walker, the son of divorced 
                parents! That was enough to make him almost an outcast, and surely 
                put him out of bounds as far as marriage was concerned, but Rachel 
                didn't care, Bobby was who she wanted, and Bobby was going to 
                be who she would get!!! For over a year now they had been meeting 
                at the far end of the pasture, down by where the river ran slow 
                and gentle. Hidden by the trees, the two of them had spent the 
                last twelve months getting to know each other, and as is wont 
                in these cases, getting more intimate with each passing day. At 
                first Bobby was afraid to touch Rachel's hand, his shyness making 
                it hard for him to even look her in the eye! Over time, however, 
                the two of them forged a bond that began as friendship, but evolved 
                into love. From the first kiss which had Bobby shaking so hard 
                he missed Rachel's mouth and kissed her nose, to the first intimate 
                caress, a now much more assured Bobby, cuppd the full bosom of 
                his lover through her blue summer dress. Two young lovers learning 
                about each other's bodies together, taking their time, enjoying 
                each step as they awakened to new and exciting experiences. They 
                had progressed by now, to the point that when they would meet, 
                they would quickly shed their clothing and take a dip in the warm 
                river water, frolicking and enjoying each other's company, and 
                while they had not consummated their love, they were taking a 
                great chance that their sacrilegious behavior would be discovered 
                and that they both would be severely punished. Their luck seemed 
                to be holding as no one ever came to that part of the river, so 
                they played in the water, their young bodies free and open, while 
                reveling in their young love. While they were sunning themselves 
                on the sandy shore, their eyes closed, holding hands, and naked 
                as the day they were born, they didn't even notice the small two 
                man skiff that was floating past them on the slow moving river. 
                If they had, they would have seen Ben Barker and Hank Flowers 
                poling their boat within thirty feet of them, their mouths hanging 
                open in stunned silence at the sight of the two naked teenagers. 
                So when they finally dressed and returned to their homes, they 
                had no idea of the deep trouble they had gotten themselves into! 
              </p>
              <p>The loud knock on the door came as a surprise, because it was 
                customary not to interrupt people during dinner hour. John opened 
                the front door, only to find three members of the town council 
                standing before him with grim looks on their faces. &quot;Good 
                evening gentlemen,&quot; offered John, &quot;and what brings you 
                way out here on this fine June evening?&quot; &quot;Good evening 
                Brother John,&quot; answered a very somber William Hawkins, &quot;this 
                is not a pleasure call, but it something we must discuss with 
                you with great reluctance!&quot; By now Catherine Smith had joined 
                her husband at the door, and after inviting the three visitors 
                inside everyone took a seat and got comfortable before John leaned 
                forward and said, &quot;You had something on your mind, William?&quot; 
                &quot;John,&quot; William answered, &quot;you know the penalty 
                for fornication?&quot; &quot;What's this about, William,&quot; 
                questioned John, &quot;why would the law against fornication have 
                anything to do with me?&quot; &quot;Not you, John, but I regret 
                to say it, but about your daughter, Rachel,&quot; replied William. 
                &quot;What about Rachel,&quot; boomed John, &quot;you had better 
                explain yourself in a hurry, William or I'll be fit to take my 
                broad ax to you and your brethren!&quot; Rachel, still sitting 
                at the kitchen table, felt the bottom fall out of her tummy, a 
                sickly feeling spread through her that made her feel like vomiting. 
                William continued on, &quot;John, do you think I'd come here and 
                make a charge like this if I didn't have solid proof against her?&quot; 
                &quot;What, what kind of proof do you have,&quot; demanded the 
                very agitated father?!? &quot;John, Catherine, Ben and Hank were 
                within a stones throw of your daughter and young Robert Walker 
                sunning themselves in the altogether down on the bank of the Floyd 
                River,&quot; explained William, &quot;both of them had their eyes 
                closed, so they never knew that they'd been seen.&quot; &quot;Robert 
                Walker,&quot; John Smith fairly shouted, &quot;no daughter of 
                mine would ever be seen any where with that young ruffian, let 
                alone naked on a river bank where anyone could see'em!&quot; William 
                cast his eyes towards Rachel, and was about to ask her if what 
                he said was true, but he was stopped short by her outburst of 
                sobs!!!</p>
              <p>John Smith leaped out of his chair and strode over to his daughter 
                and grabbed her by the arm and jerked her to her feet while demanding, 
                &quot;Did you debase yourself against God and family with young 
                Walker!?!&quot; Rachel, now bawling even harder, tried to reply 
                but was unable to due to her uncontrollable sobbing. Her father, 
                now in a fit of rage, dragged her across the room and threw her 
                at William and screamed, &quot;Get her out of here, she is no 
                longer a daughter of mine, she has brought great shame to this 
                house, and will not be forgiven!!!&quot; William and his men then 
                led the crying girl out of the house and put her in the carriage 
                for the trip back to town. Through all this, Catherine Smith was 
                also sobbing, but more quietly and to herself, she tried to wave 
                a final good by to her daughter, but John Smith pulled down her 
                arm in disgust and said, &quot;She's made her own bed, Catherine, 
                and now she must sleep in it!!!&quot;</p>
              <p>The two horse carriage made good time back to Kirkville, and 
                thankfully Rachel had calmed down quite a bit by the time they 
                hit the town square. To her shock and dismay, however, her lover, 
                Bobby Walker, was already in a pillory in the middle of the town 
                square! A small group of youngsters, mostly boys, were throwing 
                taunts and derisive insults, as well as a few well placed rocks 
                at the immobile offender. Rachel broke down in tears all over 
                again at the thought that she too might soon be made a public 
                laughing stock along side her paramour! The carriage wound its 
                way through town, until it reached its final destination, the 
                church, the tallest and most imposing building in the small town. 
                &quot;Why are we stopping here,&quot; asked Rachel in a small 
                frightened voice? Ignoring her question, two of the men took her 
                by the arms and led her up the path to the front doors of the 
                old structure where William knocked and waited for and answer!!! 
                Almost immediately the large door swung open, behind which stood 
                Deacon Henry Hancock, a direct descendant of the signer of the 
                declaration of independence!!! Dressed in black, his coal black 
                eyes burned with a passion that had always terrified Rachel, enough 
                so that she would go out of her way to avoid contact with him. 
                His fire and brimstone sermons were enough to frighten anyone, 
                especially the young children of the congregation who looked upon 
                Deacon Hancock with almost god like reverence. His deep powerful 
                voice filled the church entrance when he said, &quot;Thank you 
                fellow brothers, it is God's will that this sinner be punished 
                and made top pay for her transgressions, and I will endeavor to 
                make her see the error of her ways!&quot; The three men nodded 
                and turned around, leaving Rachel alone in the presence of her 
                judge and jury!!!</p>
              <p>The Deacon closed and locked the door and told Rachel to follow 
                him, his towering frame seeming even larger in the semi darkness 
                of the candle lit sanctuary. He led her to the very front of Church, 
                right up to the altar, where he spun around and in a voice that 
                sounded like a lion's roar accused her of sinning in the eyes 
                of the Lord!!! Rachel again began to sob, aware that Deacon Hancock 
                had the power to literally have her put to death! &quot;Confess 
                to me child,&quot; he exploded, &quot;confess your sins to me 
                in front of almighty God!&quot; In a small voice Rachel replied, 
                &quot;I have sinned in the eyes of the Lord, and am sorry.&quot; 
                Deacon Hancock then thundered, &quot;You must describe your sins 
                in detail in order to gain absolution, tell me of your transgressions, 
                girl!!!&quot; A totally mortified Rachel then recounted her actions 
                with Bobby, stopping short, however, of admitting any acts of 
                intimacy. The Deacon, his eyes flashing his displeasure, fairly 
                screamed at her, &quot;If you do not admit your sins, you will 
                not be saved, and fire and brimstone will be your final resting 
                place, you must be pure in the sight of the Lord,&quot; he continued, 
                &quot;and only in your original naked self can you be truly saved!&quot;</p>
              <p>A shocked Rachel then stood by helplessly while the powerful 
                man literally tore her clothing from her body until she was standing 
                naked before him. Rachel was a full figured young woman with very 
                large heavy breasts and wide womanly hips, created a most appetizing 
                sight for the male of the species, but it was her vagina that 
                was covered with a thick coat of brown pubic hair that was her 
                most alluring feature!!! She tried to cover herself with her arms, 
                but it was impossible to hide all of her womanly charms while 
                Deacon Hancock led her to the altar and announced, &quot;The only 
                way for you to be cleansed of you sin is if you are taken by a 
                man of the cloth in the presence of the Lord!&quot; Rachel shuddered 
                in fear, but offered no resistance when the Deacon lifted her 
                upon the alter and spread her young thighs wide apart. While she 
                and Bobby had touched each other, they had never done what Deacon 
                Hancock was about to do to her as his mouth covered her hairy 
                vagina and his tongue probed her tight little slit until it came 
                to rest on her tiny bud!! Her body shook involuntarily as his 
                tongue worked its way up and down her crack, each time stopping 
                to give her clitoris a special licking. Being young and sexually 
                inexperienced, Rachel had and abundance of reserved sexual energy 
                stored up, so it was no surprise that her first orgasm was brutally 
                hard, with her vagina flooding the Deacon's mouth with cunt juice 
                while her pussy convulsed for a good minute and a half. While 
                she lay there panting and her head spinning at just what had occurred, 
                the Deacon stood up and asked her if she felt that some of her 
                sin had been forgiven? She nodded her head yes, a watched in fascination 
                as the Deacon slowly undid his pants and let them fall to the 
                floor, exposing a giant sex organ, at least twice the size of 
                Bobby's!!!</p>
              <p>His penis looked like a huge cudgel sticking out from his crotch, 
                like a weapon, long and thick, a terror to any vagina that got 
                in its path! Rachel began to whimper, knowing that she was still 
                a virgin, and that in a matter of seconds her little pussy was 
                going to be invaded by a monster it had no defense against! Deacon 
                Hancock stared down at the quivering girl, and in his deep resonant 
                voice intoned, &quot;This will purify you of your remaining sins, 
                do you believe?!?&quot; Now in a state of total submissiveness 
                and fear, she nodded her head and weakly replied, &quot;Yes, Deacon, 
                I believe,&quot; while her legs shook as the giant erection probed 
                her outer lips, feeling along her crack as if to try and find 
                a weakness before beginning its attack!!! The head, the size of 
                a small lemon, pushed its way into her canal, stretching her far 
                beyond what she though it would go, and although it hurt crazy, 
                a mixture of pain and pleasure spread like warm water throughout 
                her entire crotch. Having just had a one very hard orgasm from 
                oral contact, Rachel could instantly sense that she would soon 
                be experiencing another one at the expense of Deacon Hancock's 
                huge erection, and while he slowly forced his big penis farther 
                and farther into her tightness, it tried in vain to accommodate 
                the thick cock flesh as she moaned, &quot;It's so big, &quot;oh 
                god does it hurt!!!&quot; The Deacon responded to her moan by 
                plunging his dick all the way to the hilt, which of course, resulted 
                in the young girl having her vagina torn apart by another incredible 
                orgasm! </p>
              <p>&quot;Girl,&quot; the Deacon barked, &quot;do you still want 
                to be forgiven of all of your sins?!?&quot; &quot;Yes sir,&quot; 
                Rachel answered, still shaken from the reaming her virgin pussy 
                had just endured. &quot;Well then,&quot; he continued, &quot;get 
                on your knees and pray with me, pray that you shall follow the 
                righteous path laid down for you in the Holy Bible!!!&quot; Rachel 
                got to her knees and bowed her head in prayer, only to be interrupted 
                by the booming voice of Deacon Hancock. &quot;Look up to me girl, 
                look into my eyes and feel the Lord Almighty giving you absolution!&quot; 
                Lifting her face to gaze into the black coldness of his black 
                eyes, Rachel instead was staring directly at the mighty sex organ 
                that bobbed up and down in front of her mouth. The Deacon moved 
                a little closer, until the smooth purple head was just brushing 
                against Rachel's lips, and with just a little more pressure, and 
                the big knob popped into her warm mouth, carrying with it a slightly 
                salty taste, which wasn't all together unpleasant! Rachel, while 
                at first apprehensive about sucking on the Deacon's cock, had 
                to admit that it was making her vagina get that itchy feeling 
                once again! Her nipples were shriveled up and hard, and Rachel 
                took one of them in her hand and gently twisted it, causing her 
                pussy to tighten even more! The Deacon, on the other hand, was 
                staring down at a beautiful big titted eighteen year old girl 
                who was giving his pecker the sucking of his life! She looked 
                almost angelic in the pale candle light, but how many angels have 
                you ever seen with a nine inch cock in her mouth?!? The sight 
                of his huge boner in the pretty little mouth was more that the 
                Deacon could stand, and his cock exploded in a cum spurting orgasm 
                that spilled out of her mouth and down onto her pretty chest! 
                Rachel tried to swallow it all, but the torrents of cum came too 
                hard and fast for her, and the warm cum splattered across her 
                boobs after which The Deacon pulled the cum covered girl to her 
                feet and ordered her to clean herself up.</p>
              <p>After dressing, Deacon Hancock sat her down and lectured her 
                on the sins of the flesh, exhorting her to find strength in the 
                Lord and keep herself pure until marriage! She would have to live 
                in the church for the next month to complete her period of absolution, 
                and Deacon Hancock would personally be in charge of her penance! 
                Tomorrow they again would &quot;pray&quot; together, asking the 
                Almighty to guide her to the path of righteousness!</p>
