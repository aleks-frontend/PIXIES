              <p>I never believed anything like this could ever happen to me, but I'm 
                here to tell you that everything here in happened just as it occurred 
                one year ago. Just to set the stage and give you a little back 
                ground, I'm a happily married woman for eight years now, with 
                two beautiful children and a husband who loves me!!! We aren't 
                rich or anything, but my husband is a very successful corporate 
                lawyer, so we're not hurting any, and by most standards we'd be 
                considered upper middle class! At the time of the &quot;incident&quot;, 
                we had been married for seven years and both of us, my husband 
                Pete and me, my name's Kaye, had been totally faithful to each 
                other! The honeymoon had definitely worn off, but our sex life 
                was pretty good, and neither of us, well me for sure at least, 
                never even thought about greener grass on the other side of the 
                fence! Oh sure, if I saw an attractive man I might think what 
                he might be like, ya know, in the sack, but never more than a 
                fleeting fantasy! We were just a couple of thirty something people 
                who had a comfortable life together and who basically were just 
                cruising along!!! And that, dear readers, is how this story begins!!!</p>
              <p>Living in a big city, and coupled with the fact that Pete's law 
                firm does work for a lot of the large corporations based here, 
                we get a lot of invitations to functions connected with Pete's 
                work! A lot of them are boring as heck, but usually you get a 
                pretty good dinner out of it, and sometimes even the speaker is 
                interesting!!! Well, about one year ago, we were attending a fund 
                raiser for the local chapter for abandoned children! This particular 
                event was a little different from most, in that there was assigned 
                seating, and husbands and wives were split up and placed at different 
                tables!!! Since I didn't know very many of the people attending 
                this fund raiser, I immediately wished that I had stayed home, 
                since I didn't have Pete to keep me company! The last thing he 
                did before we split up, was kiss me on the cheek and wish me luck, 
                and then he was off on his own looking for his table!!! I walked 
                around the ball room until I found table twenty three, and sure 
                enough, there was a place setting with my name on a little card 
                in the middle of my dinner plate! As I was about to sit down, 
                a voice from slightly behind me said, &quot;Well, at least I get 
                to sit next to a pretty lady, that makes it all worth while!!!&quot; 
                I turned to see who my unknown admirer was, and to my shock, it 
                was someone that I knew, well not personally mind you, but I had 
                seen him on television a hundred times, and I felt like I knew 
                him!!! &quot;Hi,&quot; he said with a dazzling smile, &quot;I'm 
                Jamere Jenkins, but everyone calls me JJ!!!&quot; I must have 
                looked like an idiot, because my mouth was probably hanging wide 
                open, but I managed to introduce myself and then sit down!!! He 
                took his place next to me and said, &quot;I'm representing the 
                team here to night, management wanted a big name, so they asked 
                me, and from the looks of things I'm glad I came!!!&quot; &quot;I 
                must have turned six shades of red, but when the star of the local 
                professional basketball team throws you a compliment, well, I 
                had to admit it felt pretty good!!! </p>
        <p>In person, JJ was even more handsome than he appeared on TV!!! Everything 
          about him was perfect, from the suit of clothes he was wearing to the 
          perfectly straight white teeth that shone like ivory every time he flashed 
          that million dollar smile!!! And from what I had read it was worth a 
          million, as JJ was very popular as a pitch man for a variety of products!!! 
          I had to admit that although I hadn't had much contact with African 
          American men, it was obvious that this one was extremely attractive!!! 
          As the evening wore on, JJ became more forward, taking every opportunity 
          to touch my arm as to make a point about something he was saying!!! 
          It was embarrassing, but every time we made contact, I could feel a 
          jolt run through my body, just like a damn school girl!!! Our table 
          was off to the side of the room, right next to and exit that led into 
          a side corridor, so it was easy for anyone at our table to slip out 
          if he or she had to use the rest room or make a phone call! During a 
          particularly dull part of the program, JJ leaned over and whispered 
          in my ear, &quot;I'm going out in the hall, after about two minutes 
          excuse yourself and go to the ladies room!!!&quot; Before I could ask 
          why, he was up and out of his seat and disappearing through the side 
          door!!! I sat there dumbfounded, wondering what on earth a major star 
          like JJ would want with a suburban housewife, but in exactly two minutes, 
          I excused myself and headed for the ladies room!!!</p>
        <p>I was almost there, when I heard him calling me from around the corner, 
          &quot;Kaye,&quot; he whispered loudly, &quot;over here, hurry up!!!&quot; 
          I walked over to him slowly, wondering what the heck was up, but in 
          the back of my mind knowing full well that I should turn around and 
          run away!!! When I reached him, he took me by the arm and pulled me 
          into a small closet that contained cleaning supplies and a large industrial 
          vaccuum!!! &quot;W-what do you want,&quot; I stammered, while knowing 
          damn well what the answer was!?! &quot;Just this,&quot; he said, before 
          pressing his lips to mine and giving me one of the most passionate kisses 
          I had ever experienced!!! I was stunned, almost like a deer caught in 
          headlights, wanting to move, but unable to do so!!! He them whispered 
          hoarsely into my ear, &quot;Kaye, from the moment I saw you I knew I 
          had to have you!!!&quot; &quot;Have me,&quot; I said between deep breaths, 
          &quot;I'm a married woman, we can't..........&quot; But he shut me up 
          with another mind numbing kiss, the kind that makes your knees go weak 
          and your resolve disappear!!! The power I felt in his arms was incredible, 
          and the sheer force of his personality was enough to make even a very 
          faithful wife forget all about her husband and children!!!</p>
        <p>When we pulled apart he said softly, &quot;You are one of the most 
          beautiful women I have ever seen, and I want you to know, I am going 
          to have you!!!&quot; I couldn't believe what was happening, and even 
          more unreal was the fact that I was nodding my head and agreeing with 
          him, me a married woman, making love to a strange black man in a janitor's 
          closet!!! Again, he knew exactly what to say and when to say it, &quot;Kaye, 
          have you ever been taken hard, I mean really hard and totally ravished 
          by someone who is insane to have you!?!&quot; By now my knees were like 
          Jell-O, and it was all I could do to whisper, &quot;N-no, never!!!&quot; 
          &quot;Turn around, Kaye,&quot; he said softly, &quot;face away from 
          me and lean against the wall with your hands!!!&quot; Still a little 
          unsure of myself, I offered no resistance when he gently but firmly 
          turned me around and leaned me away from him!!! &quot;W-what are you 
          going to do to me,&quot; I stammered, while trying to look back over 
          my shoulder!?! &quot;Look straight ahead,&quot; he ordered, &quot;you'll 
          find out in a minute!!!&quot; I could here him breathing hard now, but 
          mixed in with his pantings, I heard the unmistakable sound of a zipper 
          being lowered, and almost involuntarily, I groaned at the prospect of 
          what was happening right in back of me!!!</p>
        <p>&quot;Are you ready, Kaye,&quot; he asked quietly?!? &quot;R-ready 
          for what,&quot; she gasped, &quot;you still haven't told me what you 
          want with me!?!&quot; &quot;Oh, Kaye,&quot; he chided, &quot;you disappoint 
          me, didn't you know what I meant when I said I was going to have you!?!&quot; 
          &quot;I'm not sure,&quot; I said weakly, you have to tell me, I'm not 
          used to word games!!!&quot; &quot;Ohhhhhhh,&quot; he said, &quot;I see, 
          you're not sure what my motives are, is that right?!?&quot; &quot;T-that's 
          right,&quot; I replied, &quot;you have to be more specific!!!&quot; 
          &quot;Hmmmmm,&quot; he hummed, &quot;maybe this is more specific,&quot; 
          and with a quick jerk, he pulled up my dress and with the other hand, 
          tore my panties right off, leaving me totally naked from the waist down!!! 
          He took his finger, and while probing my vagina said, &quot;Well, well 
          ,well, it seems your pussy knew what I wanted all along, cuz you're 
          as wet as any woman I've ever felt!!!&quot; &quot;Oh, jesus,&quot; I 
          moaned, &quot;k-keep doing that, it feels so good!!!&quot; &quot;My 
          finger,&quot; he said incredulously, &quot;that's nothing, feel this,&quot; 
          and with a hard shove, he rammed his hard penis deep inside of my now 
          flooded pussy!!! &quot;Ohhhhhhhhhhh, god,&quot; I groaned, &quot;you 
          are filling me up so nicely, oh, JJ, fuck me harder, ohhhhhhh that feels 
          so good, I've never...........&quot; &quot;You've never what,&quot; 
          he asked softly?!? &quot;I've never had anything like this before,&quot; 
          I said while panting hard, &quot;y-you're just taking from the rear 
          and it's like nothing I've ever felt before, so full of cock, and so 
          hard and thick!!!&quot; &quot;You mean your husband doesn't fuck you 
          like this,&quot; he asked innocently?!? &quot;You must be out of your 
          mind,&quot; I moaned, &quot;he could never make me feel like this, ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, 
          I think I'm cumming, give it to me harder!!!&quot; And he did just that, 
          ramming his erection in and out of me like piston, hard and fast without 
          missing a beat!!! Of course my orgasm was one for the ages, a white 
          woman being taken by a giant black penis, every white woman's fantasy, 
          but for me, a fantasy come true!!!</p>
        <p>As he was fucking me, I wondered if I had the chance to have this monster 
          cock everyday if I could take it, but as my third, or was it my fourth 
          orgasm plowed through me, I knew the answer, and it was when and where, 
          and I'll be there!!! On my final cum, he went a little crazy, because 
          his own climax was right in time with mine!!! I reached around and covered 
          his mouth with my hand, and thankfully, I was able to muffle the roar 
          he let loose with as his cum jetted into my very receptive pussy!!! 
          Thank god for me that there was that big vacuum sitting there, because 
          without it, I would have slumped all the way to the floor!!! Cum was 
          now running out of my pussy, but JJ even had a way of dealing with that!!! 
          He took my torn panties and gently pushed them into my vagina, making 
          sort of a make shift tampon for cum!!! Then he zipped up, I smoothed 
          my dress, and after peeking out to make sure the coast was clear, we 
          both casually drifted back to our seats as if nothing was out of the 
          ordinary!!!</p>
        <p>On the way home my husband asked, &quot;So, did you sit with anybody 
          interesting!?!&quot; I just chuckled and replied, &quot;There was a 
          guy at my table, and I certainly got my fill of him!!!</p>
        <p><br>
