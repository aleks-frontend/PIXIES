              <p> It was hidden in a cellar of an old abandon mansion about a 
                mile out side of the city limits. No one ever bothered visiting 
                the old Quartermane place anymore, a ramshackle collection of 
                farm buildings dominated by a huge old barn and a house three 
                or four times the size of any in found town. Unoccupied for at 
                least fifty years, hardly anyone left could even remember anyone 
                ever having lived there, and when the wind would blow, strange 
                sounds echoed from the holes and cracks in the tired old walls, 
                which was just about enough to discourage even the bravest kid 
                to go to poking around the place. It was a lucky thing too, because 
                what was lurking in that dank basement was as close to the devil 
                incarnate as you could find on earth! On a old solid oak table 
                lay a figure that appeared to be dead, neither breathing or moving, 
                it just lay there as if it were in a deep sleep. As sunset fell, 
                and the shadows of the evening crossed the night sky, the figure 
                on the table as if by magic began to move as its lungs filled 
                with air and it came alive, rising up and in an instant turning 
                into a bat and flying through a small broken window pane and into 
                the night sky!!!<br>
                The full moon shone brightly in the late September sky as the 
                black shape shot through the night air, making a bee line for 
                the small town of Four Corners. It's nostrils flaring, the winged 
                mammal could detect the scent of a sleeping female at more than 
                one hundred yards. Diving and darting between the houses, the 
                over powering aroma of a delicious woman wafted out of an open 
                window, and the bat deftly flew through the small opening and 
                into the dark bedroom. As if by osmosis, the foot wide bat turned 
                back into a towering six foot four inch vampire. Dressed in a 
                dark black suit, with a long black cape draped over his shoulders, 
                August Quartermane stared down at the sleeping woman and let a 
                low animal like growl rumble deep in his chest. Marie Timmons 
                was immediately awakened by the noise, and as her eyes slowly 
                came into focus, she could clearly see the outline of a large 
                figure standing next to her bed. She tried to scream, but no sound 
                would come from her mouth, she seemed frozen, unable to say or 
                do anything to defend herself. It was as if some strange power 
                had filled the room, making it impossible for her to even so much 
                as move a muscle! August Quartermane lifted his arms, with the 
                cape forming a tent over the body of the terrified woman. Slowly 
                bending down, he bared his teeth, the two large canines glistening 
                in the moon light as he bit into the neck of his shocked prey. 
                While a vampire gains sustenance from the blood of his victims, 
                there is always a strong undercurrent of sexual excitement in 
                both the vampire and his conquest, and in the case of Marie Timmons, 
                the second the razor sharp teeth penetrated her neck, her vagina 
                flooded with her own juices and she erupted with and involuntary 
                orgasm. After several minutes of feeding, Quartermane lifted the 
                nightgown of the now docile woman and quickly mounted her and 
                entered her pussy with his incredible manhood. In only seconds, 
                Marie was having her second orgasm in that last five minutes, 
                this one even more powerful than the first. A serene feeling had 
                taken her over, as she now realized that she was one with him, 
                and would be his for all eternity. He stood up over her again, 
                still not having said a word, extending his hand to help her to 
                her feet. He stripped off her nightgown so that she was totally 
                naked, and in an instant, they were both off through the open 
                window, silently gliding through the air, looking for another 
                victim. </p>
              <p>Minutes later A.G.(August Quartermane) and Marie were standing 
                over the sleeping form of an eighteen girl whose fitful slumber 
                was about to be interrupted by the two ravenous blood suckers. 
                Marie, knowing her place, waited as A.G. surveyed the situation. 
                She had an overwhelming desire to drink the blood of the defenseless 
                girl, but almost as strong was her need to orally partake of the 
                young beauty! A.G., still not saying a word, leaned over and bit 
                deeply into her neck, instantly stunning his victim into submission. 
                After drinking his fill, he stood back and let Marie feast on 
                the red nectar dripping out of the two small puncture holes in 
                the young girl's neck, while feeling Marie's gaping pussy with 
                his hand. The teenager's eyes were now wide open, but she neither 
                screamed or tired to resist in any way when Marie slid back the 
                covers, spread her legs, and then proceeded to stick her tongue 
                into the tight little vagina. The young girl couldn't help herself, 
                she was caught in a sexual grip that was relentlessly squeezing 
                her tighter and tighter. Never in her whole life had she felt 
                so feminine and in need of sexual gratification! Her eyes focused 
                on the towering vampire, but she felt no fear, only the over powering 
                need to sexually gratify him if she was asked to, or the woman 
                who was now partaking of her dripping pussy! Kari, the girl being 
                eaten by Marie, felt her vagina contracting as the relentless 
                tongue probed the length of her slit. Her orgasm was like nothing 
                she had ever experienced before, so deep and fulfilling, that 
                her whole being was climaxing along with her throbbing clitoris. 
                Marie stood up next to the bed with her legs splayed wide open 
                exposing her bulging vulva. Kari instinctively knew that she was 
                to satisfy had to satisfy this dripping pussy, and eagerly placed 
                her mouth on the erect clit at the top of the crack. In the back 
                of her mind she realized that this woman had the biggest clitoris 
                she had ever seen, and while her tongue caressed the head of the 
                giant organ, she dropped her hand to her own pussy and felt her 
                own clit, which also seemed to have grown to huge proportions. 
                As Marie came in her mouth, Kari sensed that from now on all she 
                would care about would be her need for blood and the sexual gratification 
                of her now engorged clit!</p>
              <p>Flying at breath taking speed, the two women followed August 
                Quartermane back to the dark basement just before the sun began 
                to rise in the east. Both women stood before him, naked, and ready 
                to do what ever bidding he desired. Both of them, now with a heightened 
                awareness of smell, could sense the powerful sexual aroma coming 
                directly from A.Q.'s crotch, their cunts dampening immediately 
                at the prospect of being taken by their dominant host, and as 
                if by telepathy, both of them leaned across the large table with 
                their legs spread and their pussies open and exposed. Marie was 
                the first to be impaled by the rock hard cock sticking out of 
                the blackness of his crotch, and her guttural scream could be 
                heard miles away as her body shook in orgasmic delight. Kari, 
                now in a state of absolute sexual frenzy, waited impatiently for 
                her turn at being fucked by the voracious blood sucker. When finally 
                he rammed his piston deep into her wide open organ, she clawed 
                at the top of the table, leaving deep gouges in the hard wood 
                with her sharp finger nails! Both women were now hardly more than 
                animals, being driven by their desire for blood and sex! Just 
                as a lion must kill every day to sustain its life, Maire and Kari 
                must drink blood and sexually gratify themselves on their helpless 
                victims! Now always naked, with their vaginas bulging in anticipation 
                of sexual release, the two women fly every night with August Quartermane, 
                searching out their prey, and then feasting on the blood and pussies 
                that drive their very existence!!!</p>
