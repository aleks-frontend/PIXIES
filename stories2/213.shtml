        <p>Byron wondered why he even bothered!!! After eight months of faithfully 
          working out three times a week, he still weighed only 135 pounds and 
          had arms that resembled spaghetti!!! &quot;Okay,&quot; he said under 
          his breath, &quot;let's see if we can do tonight!!!&quot; Lying on his 
          back, he hoisted the barbell into the air in an attempt to bench press 
          ninety pounds, and almost instantly he realized that he was in trouble 
          after he brought the bar down to his chest!!! Desperately he tried to 
          heft the iron off of his body, but the more he struggled, the weaker 
          he seemed to become!!! The first rule about bench pressing is to always 
          use a spotter, and at that very moment Byron was discovering the wisdom 
          of that particular idiom!!! He tried screaming for help, but the air 
          had been forced from his lungs, leaving him in the very precarious position 
          that he may suffocate in a room full of people!!! As unconsciousness 
          began to overtake him, the bar miraculously was wrenched off chest and 
          blessed air filled his burning lungs!!!<br>
          After coughing for a second or two, he struggled to his feet to thank 
          his savior, but much to his chagrin he was standing face to face with 
          a woman!!! &quot;Hey, dummy,&quot; she said while shaking her head from 
          side to side, &quot;don't you know enough to use a spotter, you can 
          get killed using free weights by yourself!!!&quot; &quot;If ya want 
          to lift alone, use a machine,&quot; she said while walking away!!! He 
          chased after her and stuck his hand out and gushed, &quot;Of course 
          you're right, I just want to thank you, I was in real trouble back there, 
          and by the way, my name's Byron!!!&quot; She gave him a quick once over 
          before breaking into a broad smile and taking his hand in her powerful 
          hand and replying, &quot;Well, I didn't mean to snap at you Byron, but 
          I just didn't want to see you get hurt, come on over here, and spot 
          for me, okay!?!&quot; As she walked in front of him, Byron for the first 
          time got a good look at her, and to say the least she was the most muscular 
          woman he had ever seen in his life!!! While she wasn't pretty, she had 
          a wholesome looking face with a solid Nordic features and a shock of 
          blonde hair that was short enough not to need a comb!!! As she positioned 
          herself under bar that contained at least two hundred pounds he offered 
          in all seriousness, &quot;I don't know if you should be trying this, 
          I don't know how much I could help you if you got into trouble!!!&quot; 
          In a quick motion, the blonde giant grabbed the bar and let it down 
          to her chest and replied, &quot;No problem, Byron, this is an easy one 
          for me,&quot; and then proceeded to press the bar ten times quickly 
          before returning it to the cradle!!! After five more sets, she sat up 
          and toweled off her face and offered, &quot;How about a soft drink, 
          I'm buying!!! </p>
        <p>They sat against the wall, sipped their diet colas, and talked while 
          absentmindedly watching others work out! He found out that her name 
          was Arianna, that everyone called her Ari for short, and that she had 
          been working out for about five years! After taking a drink from his 
          can of pop, Byron asked casually, &quot;May I ask you a personal question!?! 
          &quot;Shoot,&quot; she replied quickly!!! How much do you weigh, I've 
          never seen a woman built like you!!!&quot; She chuckled before answering 
          and replied, &quot;That's a compliment I hope, but to answer your question, 
          I weigh 225 pounds, give or take a pound or two!!!&quot; &quot;Geesh,&quot; 
          he replied in awe, &quot;I've been working out like a dog for over six 
          months and still look like a bag of bones!!!&quot; She put her hand 
          on his arm and said softly, &quot;Some people just have trouble building 
          muscle mass, it has nothing to do with how much you work out, it's all 
          physiological, kind of like you're preordained!!!&quot; He was listening 
          to her answer, but what he really was thinking about was the feeling 
          that shot through him when she touched his arm, incredible!!!</p>
        <p>With his pulse still racing, he stammered, &quot;So tell me, Ari, does 
          your husband or boy friend work out like you do, I mean, is he all bulked 
          up and all!?!&quot; When didn't answer, he quickly interjected, &quot;I'm 
          sorry, I shouldn't have asked such a personal question, please forgive 
          me!!!&quot; She touched his arm again, this time letting her hand linger 
          as she replied, &quot;No, it's okay, it's just that, well, I don't have 
          a boy friend, no man in his right mind would ever want to date someone 
          who looked like me!!!&quot; Now turning to face her, he took her hand 
          and replied, &quot;You're kidding I hope, because you're about the most 
          amazing woman I've ever met!!!&quot; It was then that he first noticed 
          that her eyes were glistening with tears, and he realized that she was 
          really hurting inside!!! He leaned forward, gently kissing her cheek, 
          and said, &quot;Let's get showered and go have some coffee!!!&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Two coffees,&quot; Byron said to the waitress in the all night 
          diner they found not far from the gym! Making an attempt at small talk, 
          Ari commented that she had never been here, but that it had a lot of 
          atmosphere! The waitress returned with their coffee, and then left the 
          two of them alone in the back booth! Byron took a long drink, put his 
          cup down, and said, &quot;I know this is may sound crazy, and don't 
          get upset, but I think that I'm in love with you!!!&quot; The words 
          hung in the air for what seemed like and eternity, until Ari replied 
          softly, &quot;I-I think I love you too!!!&quot; Byron's head began spinning 
          when he heard Ari's response to what he thought was an absolutely crazy 
          admission, but incredibly, she felt the way he did!!! They sat in the 
          booth for two hours just talking, trading information about one another, 
          and trying to go slow, even though they were anxious to dive head long 
          in!!! Outside the cafe next to their cars, they kissed under the light 
          of a lamp post, not a sexy French kiss, but a sweet affectionate kiss 
          that new lovers revel in!!! When they pulled apart, each could see it 
          in the other's eyes, it was electric for both of them!!! This was Wednesday, 
          so they traded phone numbers and made a date for Saturday evening!!! 
          As each of them drove home, they were both positive of one thing, they 
          had each found their soul mate!!!</p>
        <p>It had been a marvelous evening, just some burgers and a movie, but 
          it was better than the ballet and a five course meal at a fancy restaurant!!! 
          It seemed that they were made for each other!!! The one thing that at 
          first was a little disconcerting, was the number of stares Ari received 
          because of her overly developed body, but after a while, Byron didn't 
          even notice or care!!! Later that evening, in front of Ari's apartment 
          building, the two of them sat in the front seat of Byron's car and necked 
          like a couple of teenagers!!! After one particularly long kiss, Byron 
          looked into her eyes and whispered, &quot;I love you Arianna, just as 
          sure as I can be, I love you!!!&quot; She kissed him again, and then 
          whispered back, &quot;Come on up stairs for a while, I'll make some 
          coffee!!!</p>
        <p>Once inside of the apartment, Ari led him straight to her bedroom! 
          &quot;I thought you were going to make coffee,&quot; he said with a 
          twinkle in his eye!!!&quot; &quot;Shut up and kiss me,&quot; she said 
          as their mouths met in a passionate embrace!!! When they finally pulled 
          apart she offered, &quot;Well, I guess this is it, the moment of truth,&quot; 
          and slowly began removing her clothing!!! Byron watched in awe and fascination 
          while Ari slipped out of her dress, revealing and incredibly muscled 
          body in a thong bikini bottom and a lycra sports bra!!! &quot;Okay,&quot; 
          she said softly, &quot;your turn!!!&quot; He turned three shades of 
          red and stammered, &quot;this is so embarrassing, I feel so, I don't 
          know, inadequate, I guess!!!&quot; &quot;Why,&quot; she replied, a little 
          dumb founded, &quot;you're normal, what do you have to be embarrassed 
          about?!?&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; he stumbled, &quot;you know, it's just 
          that I'm, well you know, not really that well built!!!&quot; She smiled 
          and laughed affectionately, &quot;Don't worry, you're plenty of man 
          for me,&quot; and then proceeded to help him remove his sweater, under 
          shirt, and trousers!!! The incongruity of it all hit them together, 
          that of her being the huge muscled one and him being the proverbial 
          98 pound weakling!!! &quot;We do look like an unlikely pair, don't we,&quot; 
          she said lightly?!? With the ice broken he replied, &quot;Like Mutt 
          and Jeff!!!&quot; She looked him in the eye and asked softly, &quot;Byron, 
          can you take off my bra and panties for me, please?!?&quot; He made 
          an audible gulping sound in his throat, but with shaking hands, slipped 
          the tight fitting bra over her head!!! Her chest was like none he had 
          ever seen in person or in photographs, and he sucked in his breath while 
          trying to contain himself!!! &quot;T-they're beautiful, Ari,&quot; he 
          whispered, &quot;I can't believe how lucky I am!!!&quot; &quot;D-do 
          you really like them,&quot; she said in almost a pleading voice, &quot;most 
          men find them very unattractive!!!&quot; &quot;My god,&quot; he groaned, 
          &quot;they're unreal, m-may I touch them?!?&quot; She took in a deep 
          breath which seemed to expand her chest even more, and whispered, &quot;Please, 
          I want you to feel them, they're yours!!!&quot; What made her boobs 
          so unusual, was that her breasts were pulled tight against her chest 
          do to her massive muscle development, while her nipples stood out erect 
          and proud, almost begging to be sucked!!! At his first touch the air 
          whistled out of her, and she involuntarily pressed forward, encouraging 
          his mammalian exploration!!! Seeing her positive reaction, Byron leaned 
          down and took a hard nipple into his mouth, resulting in a loud moan 
          from deep inside Ari's throat!!! Growing bolder, he continued sucking, 
          but let his hand slip to her crotch where began feeling her mound through 
          her skimpy panties!!! Between pants she begged, &quot;I want you now, 
          please take me!!!&quot;</p>
        <p>After gently pushing her back down on the bed, he casually reached 
          out and tugged the tiny nylon thong off of Ari's hips!!! Now it was 
          his turn to suck in his breath, because right before his very eyes was 
          the most succulent pussy he had ever seen, which was shaved completely 
          bare, with lips bulging out obscenely, practically begging to be licked 
          or fucked!!! He kicked of his boxers, exposing his erection to her eyes 
          for the first time!!! He wasn't hung like King Kong, but his six inches 
          was certainly adequate, especially to a woman who hadn't been fucked 
          in over three years!!! He mounted her quickly, his penis immediately 
          finding her entrance as if it were drawn by a powerful magnet!!! He 
          kept saying to himself to go slow, but in his excitement that was a 
          hopeless ideal, so in one hard thrust he buried it deep into her wetness, 
          a union between two people who both felt like this moment would never 
          happen to them!!! As hard as her body was, her pussy was just that soft, 
          enveloping him, coaxing the seed out of his erection in waves of spurting 
          cum!!!</p>
        <p>In the end, size didn't matter, he was a man and she a woman, and each 
          performed their role like countless other couples around the world at 
          that very moment!!! She out weighed him almost two to one, and in terms 
          of strength, it wasn't even close, but when it came time, he took her 
          and made her his own, and that's how it began, for these two disparate 
          lovers!!!</p>
        <p><br>
