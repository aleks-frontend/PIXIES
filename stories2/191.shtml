              <p> Myron Baker was in a funk, his wife of thirty nine years had 
                just passed away a month ago, and he was still feeling her loss. 
                They had always talked about moving to Arizona after they retired, 
                but he could never go back there now, the memories of vacations 
                with Lucille were just to painful to relive. No, he would move 
                to Florida, they had a lot of nice retirement communities down 
                there, and even though it was more humid than Arizona, it was 
                still a lot warmer than his home state of Michigan! He also had 
                made another decision, he was going to sell his tool and die business 
                that he had run personally for over forty years. After the unexpected 
                passing of his wife, he realized that time was a very precious 
                commodity, and that from this day forward he wasn't going to waste 
                even one minute of it!!!<br>
                &quot;I wish 'Cille coulda seen this,&quot; Myron thought to himself 
                as he sunned himself next to the Olympic size swimming pool at 
                the Sol Vista Retirement Village just outside of Miami Beach. 
                After only two weeks he had met a lot of nice people and incredibly, 
                he had to admit he was having a pretty good time! He was almost 
                dozed off when a high pitched feminine voice asked, &quot;Is this 
                lounge chair taken!?!&quot; Startled by the interruption, Myron 
                opened his eyes into the bright sunlight and squinted as he tried 
                to make out who was standing in front of him! &quot;Well,&quot; 
                asked the impatient voice, &quot;is it taken or not!?!&quot; &quot;Uh, 
                no,&quot; he stammered, &quot;sure, go ahead and use it, I'm here 
                by myself!&quot; &quot;Thanks,&quot; she replied while arranging 
                her towel and then lying down, I'm Minnie Cohn, and your........&quot; 
                &quot;Uh, Myron, Myron Baker, glad to meet you, is it Mrs. Cohn,&quot; 
                he asked? &quot;Was,&quot; she replied, &quot;I lost Stu over 
                a year ago, moved down here to get away from all that, what about 
                you Myron, you married!?!&quot; I lost my wife six months ago,&quot; 
                he responded, &quot;same as you, moved here to get away from it 
                all!!!&quot; She stuck her hand out and said, &quot;Well, Myron, 
                glad to meet ya!!!&quot; For the next two hours they regaled each 
                other with the stories of their lives, the laughing, crying, and 
                sighing, it was all there, for each of them it was like a catharsis, 
                it was just good to be able to actually tell someone how the other 
                felt!!! At four o'clock Myron noticed his watch and said, &quot;I've 
                got to run a few errands, but if you're free, I'd like to take 
                you out to dinner!&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; Minnie replied, &quot;I'll 
                have to check my busy schedule, just kidding she said with a laugh, 
                sure, dinner would be nice, it's a date!!!&quot; As Myron drove 
                down the street, he couldn't get Minnie Cohn out of his mind, 
                and the last thing she had said, &quot;it's a date&quot;, made 
                him shiver a little thinking about that, he hadn't been on a date 
                in over thirty nine years!!! </p>
              <p>They ate, they drank, they danced, it was a wonderful evening, 
                Myron was attracted to this fire cracker from New York, and he 
                felt that she liked him too. As they pulled into his parking space 
                back at the Village, as everyone around here called it, Minnie 
                reached out and placed her hand on his thigh and said softly, 
                &quot;Why don't you come up for some coffee?!?&quot; Myron sat 
                on sofa while Minnie warmed up a fresh pot, and even though he 
                was sixty four years old, he was as nervous as a sixteen year 
                old on his first date!!! &quot;Here we are,&quot; she said, while 
                handing him a steaming cup and sitting down next to him on the 
                sofa, &quot;I had a great time tonight, Myron!&quot; &quot;Me 
                too, Minnie,&quot; he replied, &quot;I haven't danced like that 
                in a long time, I'm surprised I even remembered how to do it!!!&quot; 
                Minnie set her cup down on the coffee table and turned to Myron, 
                and in all seriousness asked, &quot;Has it been a long time since 
                you've done &quot;other&quot; things, too!!!&quot; He didn't get 
                her drift for a second, but when he did, he stammered, &quot;Uh, 
                well, it's been a long time, yes, what about you, Minnie?!?&quot; 
                &quot;Much too long, Myron, but I think that that is about to 
                change!!!&quot; With his coffee cup still between them, Minnie 
                leaned over and gave Myron a soft kiss that seemed to last for 
                ever! When she finally pulled away, there were two hearts that 
                were beating a mile a minute, and two smiles that told the whole 
                story!!!</p>
              <p>It was strange and wonderful watching Minnie undress, in over 
                forty years, he had only seen his wife, but here he was seeing 
                a new partner for the first time, and it was in fact very arousing!!! 
                &quot;I'm not gonna do this alone,&quot; she said softly, &quot;don't 
                you think you should take yours off too!&quot; &quot;Uh, yeah, 
                right,&quot; he stammered, while undoing his belt and letting 
                his trousers drop to the floor around his ankles! As he had been 
                staring at her, she watched in fascination as he finally slipped 
                off his boxers, and when his erection popped into view she sighed, 
                &quot;Oh, Myron, it's very nice!&quot; They met each other in 
                the middle of the room and embraced, while kissing each other 
                for the second time that evening, but this time with more passion!!! 
                Myron's penis pushed against Minnie's soft belly, while her large 
                breasts squished softly against his chest! &quot;Come on,&quot; 
                she whispered, while leading him by his erection to her bed, &quot;it's 
                time!!!&quot; Her mouth engulfed him, and he groaned out loud 
                as she gently licked and sucked his cock head like it was a rare 
                piece of art!!! Between sucks, she panted, &quot;I haven't had 
                a man in my mouth since my husband died, and I'd forgotten how 
                good it can taste!!!&quot; &quot;Oh, god, Minnie,&quot; he sighed, 
                &quot;you do that so well, I never thought this could happen to 
                me again!!!&quot; &quot;Do you want to cum in my mouth,&quot; 
                she whispered?!? &quot;I do,&quot; he replied, &quot;but I want 
                you in my mouth when I do it!!!&quot; &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; she 
                responded, and quick as a cat, spun around and lowered her dripping 
                pussy onto his mouth while sticking his member back into her hungry 
                mouth!!! Both of them moaned as they each pleasured the other's 
                genitals, and luxuriating in the wonderful sensation of being 
                orally satisfied while sucking on the others genitals!!!</p>
              <p>Neither one of them wanted to rush it, it felt too good to go 
                to fast!!! Even though she wanted to grind her pussy into Myron's 
                open mouth, she kept it just off of his lips so he could gently 
                tongue and probe her open slit! In an almost teasing fashion, 
                he would let his tongue caress her bulging lips up and down her 
                crack, while occasionally flicking over her erect clitoris! The 
                slowness of his licking was slowly but surely driving her right 
                up the wall!!! She on the other hand, was giving the head of his 
                penis tiny little kisses and licks, keeping him right on the edge 
                of the precipice, but not letting him go over it!!! The fury growing 
                inside of her vagina had now built past the point of no return, 
                and while only a few seconds ago she was in complete control of 
                the situation, now her clit had taken over her actions!!! Almost 
                involuntarily she forced her cunt hard onto his mouth, grinding 
                her clit all over his lips in a desperate attempt to bring herself 
                to orgasm while at the same time, her own mouth swallowed up his 
                erection whole, wantonly urging him to ejaculate down her throat!!! 
                Both of them were now on automatic pilot, urging the other with 
                their insistent tongues to climax into their mouths!!!</p>
              <p>It was hard to concentrate on what you were doing, on one hand 
                your mouth was full of an excited sex organ, but on the other 
                hand, your own genitals being sucked to ecstasy!!! It was Myron 
                who gave it up first, but it was not without warning, as seconds 
                before his orgasm he groaned hard into Minnie's drooling pussy!!! 
                God she was hungry for it, a load of cum in her mouth, it had 
                been so long!!! The first blast hit the back of her throat causing 
                her to temporarily gag, but she quickly rebounded and sucked down 
                the following spurts with ease!!! Her pussy, now running on the 
                ragged edge of climax, wrenched hard as her mouth became the repository 
                for his torrent of sperm!!!</p>
              <p>She rolled off of him, with both of them panting quietly, reveling 
                aura of sweet love making!!! &quot;Minnie,&quot; he said softly 
                while rubbing her thigh, &quot;I never believed in love at first 
                sight, but I truly believe in it now!!!&quot; With her hand finding 
                his penis and caressing it softly, she replied, &quot;Don't worry, 
                Myron, you'll never be alone again!!!&quot;</p>
