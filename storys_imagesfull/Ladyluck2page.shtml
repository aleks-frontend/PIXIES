              <p> I'd been sidelined and timed out before Chloe came into my life. Just 
          about ready to head for the backwoods and become a certified hermit. 
          Until I suddenly found out that instead of being all alone in the world 
          I had myself a best friend, a business partner and the girl of my dreams, 
          all wrapped up in one beautiful little package. And the way I figured 
          it, if I was lucky enough to have somebody like Chloe literally fall 
          into my lap out of nowhere, then maybe I lucky enough to turn my business 
          problems around. 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "325" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/p53n.jpg"> 
        <P> Whatever, it sure wouldn't be for want of trying. So I started hustling 
          again while she stayed back at the apartment picking up the treads of 
          what I'd been trying to achieve before my train fell off the tracks. 
          What surprised me was that Chloe stopped me from taking down some pretty 
          raunchy photos of my ex-girl friend I was using as screen savers. I 
          didn't argue but those images were going as soon as I had a chance to 
          get my hands on the keyboards -- the last thing I needed was to be reminded 
          of a mercenary little bitch who'd taken off as soon as the debt collectors 
          had started phoning. 
        <P> It's an odd thing about luck: how it seems to run in patterns. That's 
          the way it is in my life anyway. Not good and bad and good and bad, 
          but more like a tide. Once things start to go wrong they seem to keep 
          on turning sour until you're stuck down in the mud and hanging onto 
          the jetty to stop from tipping over. And then maybe the moon changes 
          or the stars line up or something and water starts flowing back underneath 
          your keel. It was like that this morning; things went much better than 
          I expected they would and I wanted to tell Chloe about it as soon as 
          possible. About how I'd seen Bob Hanson down at the bank and how it 
          looked as if they might give me a second bite at the cherry. Provided 
          I could get somebody else involved in the business, somebody with a 
          proven record in sound business administration. 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "254" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/bdx8.jpg"> 
        <P> Chloe listened to what I was saying and asked some questions. Sharp 
          ones as well, right to the point. It occurred to me that I'd never actually 
          gotten around to asking her what she did for a living. Maybe that sounds 
          weird but I'd only known her for a day and a night -- and boy, what 
          a night! It's a strange story but I've already told it, so I won't rehash 
          it again. Anyway, I ended up giving her the names of the business types 
          I knew well enough to speak to and who had reputations solid enough 
          to keep the bank from dropping me in the financial garbage disposer. 
          There were four on the list and either I got one of them to commit to 
          my company or the fat lady was going to start singing. 
        <P> "OK, Rand, so give me those names again, will you?" 
        <P> "Sure: Ray Rice, Piet Schmued, Ken Tank and Ed Johnson. Anyone of 
          them would do fine. The problem is that all of them are already making 
          piles of cash with the companies they've already built up. I think I've 
          got a marketing concept which is absolutely fantastic but I need more 
          start up money to prove it, and I don't get the money without one of 
          those names on the company letterheads." 
        <P> "But if you've got it right the one who joins us will become very 
          seriously rich?" 
        <P> "That's right, honey, we all will. But that's an act of faith right 
          now." 
        <P> "Well, Rand, it sounds to me like we're going to have to seduce one 
          of them." 
        <P> "What! What do you mean, us?" 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "293" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/34g3.jpg"> 
        <P> "I'm sorry, darling, I'm getting all mixed up. What I meant to say 
          was that one of us is probably going to have to seduce one of them into 
          helping us out. After all, if we can't offer them any money and our 
          stock options are only blue-sky, then sex is the only thing we've got 
          left to bargain with." 
        <P> I could just imagine the way she was smiling as she was talking to 
          me but I had no idea as to whether she was being serious or not. So 
          I asked her exactly that. 
        <P> "Rand, of course I'm being serious. This is all about saving your 
          business, isn't it? You don't think I'd joke about something like that, 
          do you?" 
        <P> "But, baby ... " 
        <P> "I mean, the only question is whose going to head up your company 
          PR department? And unless one of your targets is gay and you've got 
          some sexual orientation I'd be surprised to hear about, then I guess 
          I'm the logical choice." 
        <P> "My PR department?" 
        <P> "As in pubic relationships, Randy. Or do you have somebody better 
          qualified in mind for the position? After all, you're the boss, and 
          I only do what I'm told -- remember?" 
        <P> "Remember? I still can't believe that you put your tongue where you 
          did when I told you to. But would you -- like, with another guy -- for 
          me -- I mean, for us?" 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "245" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/zq57.jpg"> 
        <P> Her voice became huskier: "I'd be under the ground if it wasn't for 
          you Rand, and I like to pay my debts. But what about these guys? Are 
          any of them hunky and spunky?" 
        <P> I gulped and wished I could say they were all hopelessly ugly nerds. 
          But Chloe was right, I needed to play every card in the pack and right 
          now she was my only ace. 
        <P> "Piet Schmued," I answered reluctantly. "He's a big guy, played football 
          at college, handsome as hell, always scored big time with the chicks. 
          But he's married now." 
        <P> "That's OK, I'm not going to steal him. I might put some wear and 
          tear on him, but I won't steal him." 
        <P> "You think you can get him to sign up with us?" 
        <P> She giggled, deep in her throat: "Well, Rand, I'm ready to give it 
          my best shot. To tell the truth, I'm thinking really deeply about what 
          you've told me and it seems like I'm going to have to do something for 
          myself to calm down again. Unless maybe you'd like to come back here 
          to the office as fast as you can and show me again what a hard boss 
          you can be to work for." 
        <P> "Chloe, lover, the next thing you're going to hear is the sound of 
          sirens following me through the red lights." 
        <P> I dropped the cell and revved up the engine in the same second. Mid 
          morning, the traffic about as good as it ever got and I guess I set 
          my own personal best time for a standing start from the CBD to the apartment 
          block. It was like that joke about the guy on viagra who quit work and 
          went home every time he got a hard on, just so it wouldn't be wasted. 
          I didn't exactly know why the idea of Chloe taking on Piet for my sake 
          had me so turned on but the images in my mind were hitting every horny 
          alert button on the entire flight deck. 
        <P> As soon as I got into the hall I damned nearly hung my laptop on the 
          hook and put my keys on the table before I realised what I was doing. 
          Then I opened the study door, saw Chloe working on one of the 'puters 
          and crept up behind her for a fast hug. 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "240" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/999c.jpg"> 
        <P> She looked up at me, smiling primly: "I'm sorry but the boss isn't 
          here right now and we don't see salesmen without an appointment. Can 
          it wait until next week?" 
        <P> I slipped my hand lower: "Gee, Ms Dooferatickle, I was really hoping 
          I could make some kind of contact today in your organisation. How about 
          down here, you think maybe I could introduce myself a little down here?" 
        <P> "Hey, I'd like to help you, Mr Donkeydick, but I don't know if I should. 
          My boss does some awful things to me if I screw up." 
        <P> "Now you mention it, Ms, how are you at screwing?" 
        <P> "Well, I always do my best for the boss, of course. But it's kind 
          of difficult to know how I'm doing -- he never says much, he just grunts 
          a lot and then goes to sleep." 
        <P> "Then it's a good thing I called round. Forget those boring old lays. 
          What you need Ms Doofertickle is exactly what I'm selling." 
        <P> "Really? What are you selling?" 
        <P> "Fucks. I sell fucks. Long ones, short ones, big ones, small ones, 
          simple ones, complicated ones, group ones, on the top of a desk fucks, 
          all the way up to Desert Island castaway fucks. Why, I even sell McFucks 
          with giveaway plastic pricks to take home to the kids. And each and 
          every one of them is guaranteed as a genuine, one hundred per cent, 
          rubber burning, come like a freight train down a mountain, screaming, 
          lung busting, satisfies all the way, totally orgasmic fuck." 
        <P> Chloe tittered like a schoolgirl and wriggled in her chair. "Wow, 
          they sound like they might be real fun. It surely seems more interesting 
          than selling insurance. But I don't think I could afford to buy anything 
          as good as you're talking about." 
        <P> "Why, Miss, this is a real lucky time for us to meet because I'm able 
          to offer you a special introductory price fuck at far below the normal 
          retail price. All you have to do is to agree to take part in a customer 
          survey we're conducting." 
        <P> "Oh -- what would I have to do?" 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "382" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/wqw4.jpg"> 
        <P> "It's nothing at all. The only thing that happens is that I undo your 
          top like this and kind of slip my hand in here. Pretty soon I'll know 
          whether you're in the market for one of our special offer fucks. Not 
          only that, but I'll know exactly which one is the right one for you 
          right now. Why, I'll even promise to refund your money if I'm not completely 
          satisfied after I've fucked you." 
        <P> Chloe giggled again: "That sounds very fair, but you must surely have 
          an educated hand there, Mr Donkeydick. Can you really tell all that 
          about me with it?" 
        <P> "Of course I can. We have lots of special training to find out these 
          things. By the way, what's your first name, Ms Dooferatickle?" 
        <P> "Well, it's supposed to be Diane, but all my friends call me Desperate. 
          Desperate Lee Dooferatickle." 
        <P> I had to break off with a fit of laughter I couldn't hold back any 
          longer. But Chloe never even twitched her lips; when she wanted to she 
          could be as stone faced as Buster Keaton. 
        <P> "Excuse me, Mr Donkeydick, but do you think I could try out this hand 
          thing as well? I'd like to see what I can find out." 
        <P> "Well, I guess you can try. Sure, go ahead." 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "254" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/7q7s.jpg"> 
          "Hmmm ... well, I know I haven't any training but I think you might 
          be ready for a fuck as well, Dicky boy." 
        <P> "You've felt one of these before then, Desperate?" 
        <P> "Oh yes, we've had one running wild around the office for a long time. 
          It belongs to the Boss but somehow his doesn't seem to measure up to 
          what you're offering, Mr Donkeydick." 
        <P> "What about a test drive, Ms Doofer? Just around the block a couple 
          of times?" 
        <P> "Gee, I'd love to but I hope you don't charge by the inch because 
          I'd need a heck of a time to pay." 
        <P> "Oh no, it's a flat charge. One fee covers all sizes -- but I'll have 
          to finish my customer survey before I can give you an exact price." 
        <P> "With that very clever hand of yours again?" 
        <P> I nodded: "Yep, that's right, Ms. Only this time I have to put it 
          up your skirt to finish covering all the ground. Is that cool with you?" 
        <P> "Er ... no. I'm starting to get hot instead of cool -- does that matter? 
        <P> "No, Ms Doofer, not at all. You just sit here on my lap and we'll 
          see how you stack up against the average customer." 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "254" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/98uz.jpg"> 
        <P> "Like this, you mean?" 
        <P> "That's exactly the right position, Ms Doofer. Now all I do is to 
          put my hand down here and find out what your exact market potential 
          is." 
        <P> Chloe gasped and wriggled around on top of my stiff cock like a landed 
          fish. 
        <P> "Oh! I've never been surveyed before. Not like this, anyway. It's 
          a pretty fun thing, isn't it?" 
        <P> "It sure is -- and guess what, Ms, I've determined that you're about 
          as ready for a numero uno fucking as you're ever likely to be in your 
          life." 
        <P> "You know, Mr Donkeydick, I was sure myself I would be -- isn't that 
          a coincidence? But how much is it going to cost me though?" 
        <P> "Uh -- a hundred francs." 
        <P> "But I don't have any francs." 
        <P> "No, but you will have when I take you to Paris. Now get your clothes 
          off." 
        <P> "Oh, you salesmen are all so masterful! I love it!" 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "364" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/buxb.jpg"> 
        <P> It was no surprise at all that when I took her sweater off to find 
          nothing at all underneath it. Chloe doesn't need any support but she's 
          got everything she needs to let you know you've got her attention. And 
          the kick I got from having her in my arms -- well, if NASA could put 
          it into a rocket we'd have gotten to Mars long ago. 
        <P> "Rand, it's so much fun being with you. You're my kind of fool." 
        <P> "The feeling's mutual, honey. But about this deal ... I guess I went 
          over the top, hey?" 
        <P> "Aww, hell, you mean I'm not going to Paris after all? Why, Mr Donkeydick, 
          I just bet you're not going to screw me either -- some salesman!" 
        <P> "Come on, Chloe, you know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about 
          Piet Schmued." 
        <P> "What about him? Can't I start off with the good looking one before 
          I have to work my way down the list to the Bill Gates lookalikes?" 
        <P> "Jees, Chloe, I only just found you -- OK, you only just found me, 
          I guess I mean to say. But it's not been 48 hour yet and already I'm 
          talking about losing you." 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "318" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/duke.jpg"> 
        <P> She settled down on top of my legs, put her arms around my neck and 
          kissed me lightly on the lips. 
        <P> "Rand, you fool, you're not losing me. We're headed for the big time, 
          together. We just need to get things started, that's all. Hey, and don't 
          think I didn't notice how fast you got back here as soon as I started 
          talking about hitting on one of those guys. I don't think it was because 
          you wanted to give any lectures on morality. So how about getting started 
          and doing something with me, Mr Donkeydick?" 
        <P> I growled like a menacing bear and slid my hands around her tight 
          little buns. Smooth, smooth skin, all the way. "Say, Ms Doofer, aren't 
          you kind of undercovered back there?" 
        <P> She giggled: "Oh yeah, it's that boss of mine, that randy Rand. He's 
          such an pain the ass that I only get to keep my job by showing him mine 
          all the time." 
        <P> "Yeah? The guy must be some kind of seriously sick pervert ... Say, 
          can I take a look as well?" 
        <P> "You mean like me taking my clothes off?" 
        <P> "I guess that's one way of doing it." 
        <P> "OK, let's try it and see what happens." 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/psio.jpg"> 
        <P> What happened was that I found myself next to the near naked body 
          of the sexiest girl I'd ever seen anywhere, anytime. 
        <P> Maybe Chloe wouldn't have got past the door at Hugh Hefner's mansion 
          but then again maybe she would. Ask me why she always made me feel such 
          a horny son of a bitch and I'll give you a straight answer -- I'd never 
          known a girl before who just plain damn enjoyed being a girl so much. 
          Maybe that makes sense to you, maybe not, but it always has done for 
          me. 
        <P> "So is this what your boss makes you do?" 
        <P> "Sure. And you wouldn't believe what he makes me do next. Why I'd 
          be too embarrassed to even tell you." 
        <P> "Aw, shucks, ma'm, why a decent southern gal like you shouldn't have 
          to tell me about all these dirty goings on. Why, you just hush your 
          mouth and show me what you have to do." 
        <P> "But I have to use my mouth to show you." 
        <P> "That's fine, Ms Doofer, you go right ahead. I'll kind of think of 
          something else while you're busy. Honestly, I don't give a damn." 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "454" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/claw.jpg"> 
        <P> Chloe eased down my pant's zip: "Then I'll have to be careful not 
          to do anything you might notice, Mr Donkeydick. Not something like this, 
          maybe ... " 
        <P> She gently put her mouth against my briefs and expelled a blast of 
          warm breath through the thin material. Of course I was much too self 
          controlled to respond to a girl bronx cheering my balls, apart from 
          twitching like a guy in an electric chair cranking up a terminal power 
          bill. 
        <P> "I'm not disturbing you at all, am I, Mr Donkeydick?" 
        <P> "Never felt a thing, Ms Doofer." 
        <P> "Fine." 
        <P> "Well, that's kind of strange, there seems to be a lot more meat packed 
          away in here in here now than there was a minute ago. What could have 
          caused that?" 
        <P> "It's a trade secret, Ms Doofer. Like I say, we have to do a lot of 
          training in my job to meet all kinds of situations." 
        <P> "Can I take a peek, please? Please? Pretty please with sugar on?" 
        <P> "OK: if you really want to." 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/p98w.jpg"> 
        <P> I was expecting her to take hold of my waistband. Only with her hands, 
          not with her teeth. Then Chloe looked up and grinned as if she was about 
          twelve years old and caught raiding the cookie jar. God, it was happening 
          again, feelings like I'd never had before. Sex is great, sex with a 
          beautiful girl is great, but sex with a beautiful girl with personality 
          plus is something else again -- especially when she seems to be as happy 
          as you are. 
        <P> She snorted with laughter through her nose, shook her head from side 
          to side like a terrier worrying a rag, then pushed her nose down inside 
          the briefs as though it was rathole. I could even her sniffing as she 
          pressed her nose against the tip of a iron hard cock that was waiting 
          to meet her. If you'd offered me my choice of any other three girls 
          to take Chloe's place I wouldn't have wanted to know. And I would have 
          bet that a hell of a lot of other guys would have felt the same way 
          as well. 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "479" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/bat2.jpg"> 
        <P> Mind you, I did wonder if I was going way over the top in my feelings 
          about her. Until I looked down and watched her pulling off my shoes 
          like a little slave girl with that same high octane mixture of school 
          girl naughtiness and burning sexuality. 
        <P> Right then and there I knew that Piet Schmued was as good as on the 
          payroll. No matter what other women he had in his life, Chloe would 
          trump them every which way. As soon as I was down to my socks she grabbed 
          hold of my pants and started hauling them off as eagerly as she'd gone 
          after my shoes. 
        <P> "You don't mind me taking your clothes off do you, Mr Donkydick? I 
          have to do it all the time for my boss because he's too lazy to do it 
          for himself." 
        <P> "Is that right? Why do you keep on working for him then?" 
        <P> "I think it must be because he fucks me stupid every day. The thing 
          is, he has such a lovely cock and I can't resist it. But yours seems 
          even better. Would you mind if I played around with it for a little 
          while? Just for some comparison shopping?" 
        <P> I was having to try really hard not to laugh. 
        <P> "Well, OK, as long as you don't mind unwrapping it." 
        <P> "Oh, that's no problem at all." She crawled on her hands and knees 
          between my legs and started calling out softly: "Cockie, cockie, come 
          to mummy -- I've got a treat for you." 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "359" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/tab3.jpg"> 
        <P> Then she bent her head down and started using her tongue to make damp 
          patches on my briefs. One big damp patch really, all up and down my 
          shaft as she bobbed it around and nibbled at the top of it. Nothing 
          at all that you'd notice really, apart maybe from that one hundred per 
          cent perfect ass my eyes accidentally fastened onto somehow. Maybe because 
          Chloe was swaying it gently from side to side like the head of a snake 
          beguiling its prey. 
        <P> "Uh, Ms Doofer ... you can take those briefs off me anytime you like." 
        <P> Her voice was on the edge of laughter: "Are you sure you don't mind 
          showing me this great big prick of yours ?" 
        <P> "No, that's OK, Ms Doofer. It's a necessary part of the service. If 
          you don't do it I can't make the agreed delivery." 
        <P> "You mean I've got to do it or I'm breaking a contract?" 
        <P> "That's right, Ms. It's against the law for you not to strip me of. 
          You wouldn't wanted to be cited for contempt of court, would you?" 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "395" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/ssx8.jpg"> 
        <P> "Oh no, I wouldn't want that to happen to me. I'd better get them 
          off straightaway, hadn't I, Mr Donkydick?" 
        <P> "I guess so, Ms Dooferatickle." 
        <P> Cloe laughed again and clawed down my briefs in no time squared. 
        <P> "Gracious me, you're in exactly the same state as my boss always is 
          when I undress him. You're surely not going to put me across my desk 
          and fuck me with that monster like he would now?" 
        <P> "Of course not, Ms Doofer. I'm not like your boss, I'm a gentleman. 
          I'm going to make you suck my cock and then I'm going to fuck you." 
        <P> Chloe stuck an attitude like a schoolgirl getting an unfair punishment: 
          "Oh, sir, but I couldn't do anything like that with you watching me 
          -- I'd be too shy." 
        <P> "Alright then, I'll keep my eyes closed while you're doing it." 
        <P> "Promise?" 
        <P> "I promise." 
        <P> "OK then, but if I catch you peeking I'll stop." 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "301" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/team.jpg"> 
        <P> Now that was a challenge I hadn't expected and I wished I'd kept my 
          big mouth shut so I could have kept my eyelids open. Still, it'd be 
          kind of interesting to see how long I'd be to resist the temptation 
          of watching Chloe blowing me. Maybe the situation had the makings of 
          a great new party game. 
        <P> "Eyes tight shut," I told her and waited. 
        <P> But not for long: her hand was on me with seconds, gently tugging 
          at my length as if making sure it was securely anchored. 
        <P> "These things are beautiful -- they're too good to be wasted on men." 
        <P> It was my turn to chuckle. 
        <P> "Well, it's true. I'd love to take one home for a pet but you have 
          to take a man along as well as part of the deal -- it's not fair." 
        <P> "Perhaps we could get something done with genetic engineering," I 
          said. "But imagine all those woman taking their pet cocks for walks 
          through Central Park." 
        <P> Cleo sniggered: "At least we'd finally have them where they belonged 
          -- on leashes." 
        <P> "I'd prefer to think of it as a plant," I told her. "And it needs 
          to be well watered if it's to keep on growing." 
        <P> "OK, OK, back to the salt mines." 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/slam.jpg"> 
        <P> God, but it was good having her lips around my cock and her tongue 
          giving the best massage you can get this side of paradise. I really, 
          really wanted to watch her doing that to me but it was too early to 
          give up on the challenge. So I began playing out a little film sequence 
          on the back of my eyelids. A scene with Piet and Chloe. 
        <P> He was sitting in my office chair and Chloe was dressed as she had 
          been when I walked in today. But now she was kneeling in front of the 
          chair and doing to Piet exactly what she was doing to me now. Every 
          time she bobbed her head down onto my cock I could imagine her doing 
          the same for him: every lick I was getting I could imagine Piet getting 
          -- in my chair, in my office, from my girl. And I didn't kid myself 
          at all that Chloe wouldn't give him just as good a head job as I was 
          getting right now. The big son of a bitch was loving it, loving it! 
          Leaning back and grinning as Chloe worked away on her knees at his cock 
          as though he was some kind of a king ... 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/t7ca.jpg"> 
        <P> My hand reached out to touch Chloe's hair, to rest on her neck then 
          pressing her face down to meet my upward thrusts. One of her hands matched 
          my move, sliding up my chest to grip my shoulder, as though I might 
          drift away otherwise. 
        <P> I wondered if she had guessed what I was thinking about. She was sure 
          smart enough: whatever, she was giving me a head pumping that would 
          have kept the Titanic afloat. And I was directing another vivid film 
          clip in my mind, a tiny fragment which kept looping around and around, 
          with Chloe bent over the chair and Piet and I standing front and back 
          as she sucked and wriggled between us. The only thing which changed 
          was whether I was fucking her from behind as she sucked on Piet's cock, 
          or whether I was filling her mouth as Piet chopped her wood pile for 
          her. And as I got closer and closer to coming the positions changed 
          ever more frequently. 
        <P> I knew I had to open my eyes again and quickly too, or it would all 
          be over before it had even begun: the images of sharing Chloe with Piet 
          were building up pressure inside my groin like a volcano getting ready 
          to blow. I caught hold of her, lifted her up, turned round and pulled 
          her down onto my lap. 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "382" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/puf3.jpg"> 
        <P> Somehow I found myself fingering Chloe as though what I'd visualised 
          had actually happened and she was a little slut who needed some rough 
          handling. I suppose I was waiting for her to pull away from me. 
        <P> It didn't turn out that way though. Chloe pressed back against me 
          and one of her arms clamped tightly around my neck as I forced her cunt 
          open. 
        <P> "Go on, Rand, go on!" She was blowing gusts of air out through her 
          nose. I went deeper, faster, harder. She rode up and down on my fingers, 
          her muscles sqeezing back against them as though I was waking a sleeping 
          animal. 
        <P> "Rand -- now! I want it now!" 
        <P> I was as far inside her as I could reach and trying to keep Chloe 
          on my lap was like trying to keep a gaffed tune from wriggling off the 
          hook and back into the sea. 
        <P> "How?" 
        <P> "Lie down and I'll ride you, lover." 
        <P> "So that's why you keep calling me Donkeydick." 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "302" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/ue92.jpg"> 
        <P> She had an outburst of giggles: "No, you fool, that was because of 
          your face. Now get down there." 
        <P> "Aye, aye, skipper. Going down now." 
        <P> I stretched out on the carpet: "Conning tower's ready for boarding 
          and standing by to blow all tanks." 
        <P> Chloe laughed out loud and settled herself on me: "OK, chief, let's 
          make some waves here!" 
        <P> What I really felt like was a racehorse which had just moved up from 
          riding school to being ridden by an ace jockey. Every other girl who'd 
          decided to throw her saddle over me had felt as heavy and awkward as 
          a sack of potatoes. Chloe was light, she was little, she was lithe and 
          lightning fast. I grabbed her hips and slam dunked her all the way up 
          and down: my fantasies about young female gymnists were finally coming 
          true. She moaned, her hair floating in swirling strands as she flicked 
          her head backwards at the top of each ascent. 
        <P> "Rand? I'll get Piet for you -- I will ... " 
        <P> I didn't want to hear this -- I couldn't stop myself from wanting 
          to hear it. 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "254" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/kk32.jpg"> 
        <P> "By screwing him?" 
        <P> Even as I said the words I drove up into harder and further than on 
          any other stroke. Chloe squealed: her arms lifted up, and it was obvious 
          she was stroking those hard budding nipples. 
        <P> "Just trying to be a good secretary, boss ... ah!" 
        <P> The scene I'd had in my mind before came flickering back into my mind's 
          eye again. "In here? In the office?" 
        <P> "Sure. Bring him here, let him think I'm your secretary. All I need 
          do is to get a chance to scratch my nails across the back of his hand 
          and smile ... mmm ... He'll call back, but the call won't get as far 
          as you." 
        <P> "And make a date?" 
        <P> "No: I'll tell him you won't be in the office tomorrow, but maybe 
          he should come around anyway to check out some files." 
        <P> "Why? Why that way?" 
        <P> "He's a guy -- he won't want to date me if he thinks he can fuck me 
          on top of my own desk, especially with me being your secretary in your 
          office. It'll bring him running ... " 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/1243.jpg"> 
        <P> I nearly stopped in mid thrust; it was as if she'd been able to see 
          into my mind and watch the scenes I'd been screening inside it. It made 
          me feel stupid and that made me feel angry. It was time she had some 
          of her smarts reamed out of instead of playing her own game on top of 
          my cock. 
        <P> Not that she needed to be coaxed down onto her knees and sprawled 
          out on top of the couch. In fact she called out my name as I opened 
          the cheeks of her ass to get at the welcome mat underneath them and 
          deliver my calling card. Afterwards she bounced back at each stroke 
          as if she was spring loaded. 
        <P> "Randy! Randy! I love it!" 
        <P> Which was nice to hear but I already knew it, because I didn't need 
          to be telepathic to know that Chloe's cunt muscles were clamped around 
          me like a oyster trying to hide its pearl. 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/462q.jpg"> 
        <P> I wondered if Piet would get her panting so hard, if she would would 
          yelp and wriggle so much for him -- and if boarding Chloe regularly 
          would be enough to entice Piet to come onboard the company. 
        <P> "He likes it threeways," I said. 
        <P> "What?" 
        <P> "Piet. We got drunk one time and he said he liked to hire two pros 
          at a time. So let him know early on you're a regular party animal." 
        <P> "OK, OK! I'll do it!" 
        <P> This was crazy, totally crazy. This girl was the only friend I had 
          in the world and I was treating her like a little tramp. But if I couldn't 
          turn things around by using her there'd be no more money, no more apartment 
          living and maybe an appointment down at social security. 
        <P> Yet -- doing what we had to was one thing. Getting a kick out of the 
          thought of turning Chloe over to Piet was something lurking in the darker 
          side of my character than I'd ever known was there. 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "447" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/nutd.jpg"> 
        <P> Which was why I shouldn't have put her down on her back for the grand 
          finale. It nearly stopped the fucking as far as I was concerned. Because 
          the way Chloe looked at me was one of those special looks again, the 
          kind of loving look that no other girl has ever given me. 
        <P> There was something there I couldn't understand. No woman who knew 
          me as well as Chloe did should be smiling at at me like that. Not like 
          I was the biggest lottery prize ever. Not like I was some hunk of a 
          film star up there on a screen and she was part of the audience. This 
          wasn't a movie and she was close enough to smell my armpits and to see 
          the fear of failure in my eyes. There wasn't anything here but the real 
          Rand and he was surely no hero to anyone. 
        <P> OK, she said I'd saved her life when we were kids. Maybe I had, even 
          though I barely remembered the incident. But what the hell had that 
          got to do with what we were now? 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "513" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/e8t8.jpg"> 
        <P> Anyway, whoever we were, the bottom line was that Chloe was below 
          me, her muscles locked tight as I grunted out her name. I heard her 
          whine and then felt her body twitching and jerking against me as I parted 
          company with a whole bunch of DNA heading south. Is there any better 
          sound than hearing a woman crying out at the pleasure you've given her? 
        <P> Well, I guess it's good to be able to call out her name in your high 
          point as well, and to know she can hear you. Especially when you can 
          remember how she used to be the little girl next door with the big hearing 
          problem. I'd felt sorry for her, I remembered that. But she'd somehow 
          turned herself from a forlorn child into a fabulous woman. 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "325" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Ladyluck2/Ladyluck2images/true2.jpg"> 
        <P> Which was maybe why I was trembling a bit myself as she hugged me 
          afterwards. I guess I'm always wary of small people who manage to achieve 
          big things. Even when they're very, very beautiful and they hold you 
          very tight. 
        <P> "Why, Chloe?" 
        <P> "Why what, lover? 
        <P> "Why me, and why now? Why are you fighting so hard to get me out of 
          the crap? Don't tell me it's because of something I did fifteen years 
          ago. Hell, I'm surprised you even remember what happened, let alone 
          care about it." 
        <P> "Rand, you've no idea of all the things I care about. But if you don't 
          want to be on the list ... " 
        <P> "Hey, lady, I would live in your heart, die in your lap and be buried 
          in your eyes." 
        <P> "Oh, Rand!" 
        <P> Yeah, there's no doubt about it, any guy who plans on making out with 
          the girls should stay awake during English lit classes. That's where 
          you get the sort of education you really need in dangerous moments.
