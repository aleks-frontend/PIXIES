        <p> I was having a bad day. My startup company had folded, I was in debt 
          for a fortune, I couldn't even get a decent job and my girl had gone 
          off with a doctor -- a female doctor. 
        <P> I'd been flying high for a while, a very little while, and now I was 
          right back where I'd started from. Which meant that the only chance 
          I got to meet great looking women was inside the pages of girlie mags. 
          It's true, what you've never had you never miss, but believe me, what 
          you've had and lost you really mourn for. And I as I looked at all those 
          horny chicks I felt as mournful as a grounded hawk. 
        <P> A feeling which wasn't improved by checking out all the double cool 
          females inside the covers of the magazine and wondering who the lucky 
          dudes were who were screwing them. Apart from also wondering why I hadn't 
          gone for a nice safe career in the magazine business instead of getting 
          involved in high tech stock market floats: soft bodies are more fun 
          than software and usually a lot easier to sell. Well, unless your name 
          is Bill Gates, I guess. 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "449" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/mmnv.jpg"> 
        <p> And then it happened. I could have sworn I was alone in the apartment, 
          the door locked, everything. Until the mag was snatched out of my hands. 
        <P> I nearly had an heart attack, then looked up to see who was there 
          and every one of my vital organs did go offline for about a second due 
          to pure shock. Because the girl who was standing beside the couch could 
          have stepped straight in amongst the bevy of lust arousing models on 
          the glossy pages and been at home as a flea on a hound dog. 
        <P> We are talking long blonde hair, a face that would have knocked any 
          king ever sideways on his throne, and a drop dead figure with perky 
          little boobs, all wrapped up -- OK, barely covered -- by "Hey, man, 
          it's like honeymoon time" lingerie. 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "254" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/klbz.jpg"> 
        <p> Maybe there are guys who know exactly how to behave when a living 
          doll like this suddenly steps into their life in her stockings, suspender 
          belt and high heeled shoes. I'm not one of them. I lay there with my 
          arm stuck up in the air like I was pretending to be the statute of liberty 
          and I didn't move a muscle. I didn't even speak, I just kind of quietly 
          spasmed. My heart was back in action and an Indie driver was pumping 
          the gas into it faster than I could burn it. 
        <P> "Hi, Rand, nice to meet you," she said, and I still gaped at her like 
          it was Independence Day and the earth's skies had been invaded by flying 
          pizzas the size of cities. 
        <P> "Who -- who are you?" I don't know how it came across to her but I 
          hadn't sounded that squeaky since I was in junior school. 
        <P> "I'm Chloe, and I'm the best thing that's ever happened to you." 
        <P> "Where did you come from?" 
        <P> "Rand, that's like asking where the rainbow comes from. By the time 
          you've finished asking the question, it's gone. Do you want me to go?" 
        <P> However confused I was about everything else, at least I knew the 
          answer to that question: "Hell, no, I don't want you to go." 
        <P> "Can I sit down?" 
        <P> "Sure, surely." I gabbled. It wasn't Independence Day, it was Thanksgiving, 
          and I didn't know whether I was the turkey or the farmer. 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "451" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/fgvc.jpg"> 
        <p> She -- Chloe -- she sat down on the couch and spread herself out on 
          top of me, with a hand stroking the inside of my left leg. About the 
          only thing which anybody could have dropped on me which might have felt 
          better would have been a million dollars, and right then I wouldn't 
          even have been sure about that. 
        <P> Hell, I wasn't even sure I hadn't somehow overdosed on something, 
          but when I gently stroked her long blonde hair she didn't disappear. 
          Not only did she seem real, she felt real. And I think maybe it's not 
          too crazy to say that what was even better, she smelt real. 
        <P> "You're not a dream?" 
        <P> "I can be anything you want me to be, Rand. Would you like me to be 
          a dream? Just shut your eyes and when you open them again, I'll be gone." 
        <P> "Then I'm not even going to blink -- but, but ... " 
        <P> "If you're still don't know whether I'm real or not, Rand, why don't 
          you let your fingers do the talking?" 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "451" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/hxpn.jpg"> 
        <p> Even in the craziest of situations there are arguments that are so 
          good you go straight along with them. I reached out with my fingertip 
          and brushed it as gently as a falling leaf against her stocking clad 
          leg. If there's anything else in the world that has the same combination 
          of smoothness and heat as female flesh under silk, I wouldn't know what 
          it is. And if there is anything else like that, I sure bet it doesn't 
          feel so good to touch. 
        <P> "OK, Rand, I can feel you, so can you feel me?" 
        <P> "I can feel you, Chloe. I also feel like Doctor Frankenstein after 
          the lightning struck." 
        <P> She giggled: "That's one lousy comment to make to a lady. Do you think 
          I'm that ugly." 
        <P> I felt like biting my tongue off: "Chloe, no, no, I think you're beautiful! 
          You're fantastic!" 
        <P> "OK, you're forgiven. You want to keep on touch testing, Rand?" 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/atoy.jpg"> 
        <p> Only about as much as I wanted to go on breathing. Or maybe a little 
          bit more. This time I tried higher up her body -- way higher, on the 
          top of one of her bra cups. Her leg might have felt fine but for sheer 
          tactile feedback there's nothing like a tit. Especially when its owner 
          is enjoying the stroking every bit as much as you are. 
        <P> "Well, am I real, Rand?" 
        <P> "I guess all I know for sure is that if you're virtual reality, and 
          I can figure a way of putting you on the internet, I'm gonna buy California 
          and Wall Street." 
        <P> She made a tiny little ladylike snort of derision: "Virtual reality? 
          Put your finger out and we'll give it the ultimate reality test." 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "451" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/dfip.jpg"> 
        <p> I can't say she confused me, because a man couldn't be more confused 
          than I already was, but it took a while before I realized what she wanted. 
          Then I did hold my finger up for her, and Chloe put it in her mouth 
          and gently drew on it as if it were a Cuban cigar. 
        <P> She was so right, it was the ultimate reality check. There's no way 
          anybody is ever put a feeling like digital sucking into a digital format. 
          It also happened to be a turn on that had me shivering with excitement. 
          Up until then I'd been so shocked by her sudden appearance that I hadn't 
          really taken in what she was. Now all I could think of was that even 
          if she'd popped up out of hell she was the sexiest little mother of 
          a demon I could imagine. Not only would I be happy to sell her my soul 
          to get on top of her, I'd throw in my visa card as well. 
        <P> "Uh, Chloe." 
        <P> Her lips slid off my finger with a final flick of a tongue that had 
          my cock reaching for the sky: "Yes, Rand." 
        <P> "Could I kind of loosen something there for you?" 
        <P> "Rand, darling, I'm here to be whatever you want me to be and do whatever 
          you want me to do. All you have to do is to say the words." 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "452" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/adti.jpg"> 
        <p> Disbelievingly, unbelievingly, as stunned as a billion to one lottery 
          winner, I tugged at a bow at the top of her teddy and watched the scarlet 
          material open up like the red sea to let the true believers have free 
          passage. Like the Israelites, I was also beginning to feel like my guardian 
          angel had finally gotten back on my case after one hell of a long vacation. 
        <P> "Do you like what you see, Rand?" 
        <P> Somehow, somebody had pushed a pool ball down my throat. "It looks 
          like the promised land," I croaked as we both looked at an exposed breast 
          as though it was a work of art. Well, it sure was as far as I was concerned. 
          A side order of heaven with a tight little cherry on the top. 
        <P> "My turn now." 
        <P> "Uh!" 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "252" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/rwy9.jpg"> 
        <p> Conversation wise, I was doing about as well as a mentally retarded 
          parrot. But there's something about having a beautiful girl pulling 
          down your pants which slows down certain parts of your nervous system 
          and sends sparks through the rest of a guy's neurons. Especially when 
          you've known the girl seeking carnal knowledge of you about as long 
          as it takes to boil an egg. 
        <P> It suddenly occurred to me that maybe I'd had an heart attack or something 
          already and died on the couch. Maybe this was the after life and it 
          only looked like my apartment and Chloe was an angel sent as a kind 
          of meeter and greeter. It didn't seem like a bad theory but if I was 
          right, and this was how they behaved in heaven, there were going to 
          be some real surprised church leaders by and by, including the Pope 
          and Billy Graham. 
        <P> Naw, the one thing every religion on earth I'd ever agreed on was 
          that God had no use for any kind of fun: if this was really the afterlife 
          I was down below in the coal cellar and loving every minute of it so 
          far. 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "451" HEIGHT = "340"  hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/ssax.jpg"> 
        <p> The next minute didn't disappoint either because Chloe knelt down 
          in front of me, slid her hands between my legs and took each of my balls 
          in her palms as gently if she was stealing eggs from underneath a sleeping 
          chicken. My throat seemed almost as stiff as my cock as I tweaked the 
          tips of her taut little boobs as though they were channel selectors 
          and I was looking for the best show around. 
        <P> It seemed like I'd already got it anyway because having foreplay with 
          Chloe felt like I was caddying for Tiger Woods. I'd do the heavy work 
          but when it came to the finer strokes of sexual technique I'd just have 
          to stand by and watch an expert at work. Where in the name of Middle 
          Earth had she come from and was there any chance at all of getting her 
          to stay around? 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "451" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/5zqa.jpg"> 
        <p> "Rand, why don't you help me take my top off?" 
        <P> "Sure, sure." 
        <P> Again, it seemed like such a great idea I wondered why I hadn't done 
          it without being told to. But how come she knew my name when I knew 
          her about as well as I knew Cleopatra? And how come she was stroking 
          my chest with her fingertips like I was Tom Cruise and she was the president 
          of his fan club? Was she at the wrong apartment, had she gotten me confused 
          with somebody who was somebody? And why the hell was I worrying about 
          things like that right now? 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "252" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/2jpk.jpg"> 
        <p> Well, the reason I was worrying about it was because when you're making 
          love to a normal kind of girl you don't have to worry about her suddenly 
          disappearing into a puff of smoke or turning into something with scales 
          from the seventh circle of the pit, or taking off over the rooftops 
          like Mary Poppins. 
        <P> But even with a girl who may do any of those things what you can do 
          while you're waiting is to pull her down into your lap and nibble at 
          her nipples. It's the second best way of persuading her to stick around. 
          And maybe this time I could get ahead of the game by suggesting the 
          first best way of getting her in the mood for a real party. 
        <P> "Chloe, how about I give you some tongue work?" 
        <P> "Maybe you should sit me down on the couch, open my legs and see if 
          I smile at you -- maybe that'll be a good clue." 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "451" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/rqer.jpg"> 
        <p> So I did, and she did, and it was. 
        <P> I went at her pussy like an ant eater going after double rations but 
          to tell the truth, there was more effort than inspiration about it. 
          I guess as good as the average guy at giving head but I couldn't claim 
          I was giving my best performance right then. As crazy as it sounds, 
          I was trying to remember if I'd brought home any old bottles or lamps 
          recently. It's strange how long some of those old TV shows can stick 
          with you. The only difference was that, unlike Major goodie shoes Nelson, 
          if I'd gotten a good looking female genie I'd screw her so hard and 
          so often that she'd end up needing a corkscrew to get in and out of 
          her bottle. 
        <P> Chloe had been laughing when I first began but as I zeroed in on her 
          clit and bounced it around like a balloon in a gale, she'd started gasping, 
          then gently moaning. 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "452" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/tt6g.jpg"> 
        <p> I sneaked a look up at her face and nearly stopped what I was doing. 
          Just for a second there, by some trick of the light, her face glowing 
          with inner pleasure, Chloe did look like a genie might look. Well, if 
          Barbara Eden was any guide anyway. And then I decided I'd better try 
          and hold onto whatever shreds of sanity I still had left. But whether 
          I was sane or mad, she was a beautiful and desirable woman, I knew that 
          much for certain and I wanted to fuck her until I wasn't fit for anything 
          but hibernation. 
        <P> Then her eyes opened and stared deeply into mine: "You're a nice guy, 
          Rand." 
        <P> "How do you know that?" 
        <P> "I wouldn't be here if you weren't a nice guy." 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/bb8y.jpg"> 
        <p> I couldn't make any sense out of that and, anyway, it really wasn't 
          polite to talk with my mouth full. But I kept looking up and saw Chloe 
          smiling at me that women sometimes do when they're looking at somebody 
          they're really fond of. Her fingernails scratched playfully against 
          my shoulders. This was a hell of a relationship, the best I'd ever been 
          in, and only five minutes old! 
        <P> "My turn again, Rand." 
        <P> "What?" 
        <P> "It's your turn to lie on the couch while I give your cock a hand 
          job and then try to suck your brains out through the end of it. But 
          only if you want me to, of course." 
        <P> I took a quick decision that I could probably live with that kind 
          of treatment and lay back on the sofa as Chloe deftly finished stripping 
          me. Then she knelt down beside me. 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "451" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/uud9.jpg"> 
        <p> For a slip of a girl she had strong hands. She kept a grip on my shaft 
          like a receiver taking a free ball and worked me up into a tight end 
          with a few quick passes. I hadn't had my meat beaten so hard or fast 
          since I had a one night stand with a lady orchestra conductor from Pittsburgh. 
          Although I've got to admit that she showed me a sure fire way of knowing 
          Beethoven's Fifth Symphony whenever I heard it beginning. 
        <P> "Take it easy, Chloe, please. Just looking at you is enough to make 
          me come ... " 
        <P> "No problem, Rand. You stay calm and quiet while I suck your cock 
          and you think about the different ways you can fuck me." 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "451" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/vv75.jpg"> 
        <p> Yeah, great, that should really calm me down. Maybe I could think 
          about something else while it was happening? Perhaps she'd only give 
          me a few licks instead of the full treatment? 
        <P> Huh! There were city sanitation trucks out there cleaning the drains 
          which couldn't suck as well as Chloe vacuum cleaned the top of my prick. 
          And all I could do take my mind off sex was to play with her lovely 
          little ass. I closed my eyes as well but that seemed to make it worse, 
          then I opened them again and saw all that lovely blonde hair hanging 
          down over my crutch and I moaned at the effort of holding myself back. 
          Any guy this chick couldn't raise was overdue for burying. 
        <P> Just to see how human she was I slipped my fingers down and under 
          to her cunt and ran them along where my tongue had been. Her legs instantly 
          opened wider and I felt Chloe rubbing herself against my hand. It seemed 
          like this was the time to start getting serious. 
        <P> "Hey, Chloe, how about we fuck?" 
        <P> "What a good idea." 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "451" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/34qz.jpg"> 
        <p> I put her down on the couch, grabbed her legs, lifted them up and 
          apart, and then hesitated for a second. It's not something I'd normally 
          do with an opportunity like this wide open and waiting, but ... curiosity 
          is a very powerful emotion too. 
        <P> "Who are you, Chloe? How did you get here?" 
        <P> She smiled that kind of half secret smile again, put out her right 
          hand, gripped my cock with her strong fingers and slid me into her: 
          "Ask no questions, lover, just enjoy what comes your way." 
        <P> It seemed like as much information as I was going to get and anyway 
          there were other things which needed urgent attention. 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "451" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/w22m.jpg"> 
        <p> Somehow we quickly maneuvered ourselves onto the end of the couch, 
          the woodwork groaning and Chloe softly moaning as I rammed my cock into 
          her as deeply as I could. The muscles inside her which had been a barrier 
          at first now held me tightly, squeezing and guiding the entire length 
          of my shaft as it worked in and out of her lovely body. 
        <P> "I'm your fuck toy, Rand, I'm your fuck toy. I love having you inside 
          me." 
        <P> "You can't be real, you can't be!" 
        <P> "Don't I feel real, Rand?" 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "248" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/9914.jpg"> 
        <p> "Yes, but ... ahhhh ... if you were a real woman, about now you'd 
          be complaining about the color the ceiling was painted." 
        <P> She giggled: "I don't have a thing to complain about, lover, not as 
          long as you keep fucking me like this. I'll always be more of a real 
          woman for you than that useless dyke bitch you just dumped." 
        <P> Now that was something which nearly stopped me dead in my strokes. 
          How the hell did Chloe know about Jodie? Even if it was hearsay evidence: 
          yes, Jodie's sexual preferences were wide ranging, but the real truth 
          was they hadn't been wide ranging enough to include me for very long. 
          She'd dumped me, not me her. But it wasn't a point I felt like arguing 
          about. 
        <P> "It's OK." I gasped, "I'm starting to get over the pain now." 
        <P> Chloe's fingers dug into my shoulders like claws: "Are you quite sure 
          about that?" 
        <P> "Yes!" 
        <P> "How about letting me get over you. You sit down and have a rest break 
          for a while." 
        <P>

        <P> What the hell, the way this girl performed I didn't care if we went 
          forty minutes each way with a marching band in the middle. But what 
          I did care about was a buzzing noise I heard as soon as her back was 
          turned to me. 
        <P> "What the fuck is that?" 
        <P> "Only a vibrator, lover. To get me really moving for you." 
        <P> "Where the hell did that come from?" 
        <P> "It was under a cushion on the couch. One of your other girls must 
          have left it there." 
        <P> No way. I'm not a slob and I clean the apartment out properly every 
          week. There sure hadn't been anything hidden underneath the cushions 
          on the couch the last time I'd been through the place: even more surely, 
          there hadn't been a girl in the place since. 
        <P> "None of them could have!" 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "254" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/fsuy.jpg"> 
        <p> "Oh well, it must have been the maid then. Listen, am I boring you 
          by being here, Rand?" 
        <P> "No! No! Chloe, please stay. I don't care if you pull an oscar out 
          of your ass and make an acceptance speech, not as long as you stay here!" 
        <P> "Oh well, that's alright then." She laughed like a little girl. "Now 
          let's see if I can both of us at once with this." 
        <P> I felt the tingling vibrations through her cent first as she squirmed 
          around on my cock and the vibrator; then the tip of it nudged up against 
          my balls. The shockwaves flowed up through them and into the top of 
          my cock, driving it up and further into Chloe than I'd thought I could 
          ever manage. But even if it was a personal best I didn't throw her off, 
          she stayed on top of me like a champion rodeo bull rider. 
        <P> "Rand! I love you!" 
        <P> I was real impressed with her as well, but I was getting sick and 
          tired of being treated like a stupid kid, what with the way she'd been 
          teasing me ever since she'd first appeared. Maybe some rougher treatment 
          would shake the truth out of her. 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/417b.jpg"> 
        <p> I turned her round, impaled her straight down on top of my cock again 
          and lowered her onto the floor like a rag doll. Then I grabbed her tits 
          and squeezed them hard. 
        <P> "Come on, Chloe. Who are you, how come you know so much about me?" 
        <P> "Do you really want to hurt me, Rand?" 
        <P> "No, I just ... " 
        <P> My voice dried up as I asked myself what the hell I thought I was 
          doing. She was right, she was the best thing that had ever happened 
          to me and already I was screwing things up between us because of my 
          own stupidity. 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "452" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/ffse.jpg"> 
        <p> I took my hands away from her boobs and instead used them to help 
          support her weight. 
        <P> "No, Chloe, I don't want to hurt you -- not ever." 
        <P> "But you want to know about me?" 
        <P> "Yes." 
        <P> "Why?" 
        <P> "Because I need to know if there's any chance of seeing you again." 
        <P> "For a fuck, Rand?" 
        <P> "For a life, Chloe." 
        <P> "OK, do me doggy style against the sofa and see if you can make me 
          talk." 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "454" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/cxzf.jpg"> 
        <p> I lined her up as she wanted and gave it my very best shot. Chloe 
          threw back her head and yelped with joy, and then started talking. 
        <P> "I'm Chloe Kickett. I was the little deaf girl you pulled away from 
          behind a reversing truck outside my house one day. I'd have been killed 
          if you hadn't done that and risked your own life." 
        <P> "But ... " I remembered what she was talking about, but I'd only been 
          about nine then and the girl had been about the same age. The family 
          had moved out of my street only a few months later, and the one thing 
          I could recall for sure about Chloe was that she'd been as deaf as a 
          post. 
        <P> "I had an operation, I can hear fine now. And I heard you were having 
          some problems. I wanted to help, I talked to Jodie. She said you two 
          were definitely through but she still likes you. She gave me her key 
          to your apartment. I came in yesterday when you were out and hid the 
          vibrator. Then I came back today with a coat over me and left it in 
          the hall as I came in." 
        <P> It was like being hit between the yes by a baseball bat: it was the 
          truth, I knew it, but it was stranger than anything I could have imagined. 
          That somebody could have done so much for me because of something that 
          had happened so long ago! 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "451" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Lady/Ladyimages/qtrd.jpg"> 
        <p> I came into her like a stallion but I was so emotionally shook up 
          by what she'd told me I was damned near sobbing. It was like being a 
          kid myself again and feeling there was somebody you could get up close 
          too and talk to without any worries, without any need to hide any of 
          your weaknesses. 
        <P> Then I felt her arm around my neck. 
        <P> "It's OK, Rand, we'll fix things up -- together." 
        <P> And that was when I knew for sure that Lady Luck hadn't knocked on 
          my door but had sneaked in anyway.
