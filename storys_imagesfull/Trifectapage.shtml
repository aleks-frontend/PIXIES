              <P> There's no telling what kind of trouble gambling can get you into. 
          Even the mildest of flutters can end up with quite unexpected consequences: 
          truth to tell though, it was betting and bad company combined which 
          was my moral downfall. And winning, of course. If it had been a bad 
          bet my conscience would still be clear -- I'd be a lot poorer though. 
        <p> Normally I never have anything at all to do with any kind of gambling, 
          even though I live in a country which is renowned as a punter's paradise. 
          But at the beginning of November every Australian has a bet on because 
          the first Tuesday in the month is Melbourne Cup day. They call it the 
          race which stops a nation and it's absolutely true. Even commercial 
          jets go into a holding pattern while the hooves are actually hitting 
          the turf. Every true Aussie everywhere watches or listens to the Cup 
          being run, whether they're at Rose Bay or Rabbit Flats, on tropical 
          beaches or above the snow line. And -- of course -- there isn't an office 
          anywhere in the Commonwealth that doesn't run an office sweepstake on 
          the Cup. 
        <p> Which is fun, but not as much fun as giving all the girls an excuse 
          to come to work in their fanciest dresses and most extravagant hats. 
          The guys let themselves go as well: maybe Australia on Cup day is the 
          only chance you get to see the state manager of an insurance company 
          coming to work wearing tails, surf shorts, thongs, and a Mexican sombrero 
          decorated with empty beer cans. It wasn't the manager I had the problem 
          with though; it was a little shit called Chris Mack. 
        <p> We'd all knocked off work for the day by two thirty and gone through 
          into the lunch room where the boss had got a cold collation laid out 
          and some bottles of wine on ice. By the time I was into my second glass 
          most of the other people in the office had arrived and were hitting 
          the grog as well. Everything was going along fine when I saw Chris sliding 
          past me to get a good possie near the TV. He's not been with the company 
          very long and he's a smarmy little smart arse, always trying to prove 
          himself at other peoples' expense. Apart from that and about twenty 
          other things I dislike about him, he had a habit of borrowing money 
          and taking longer to pay it back than a Scotsman with a superglued sporran. 
          Like I say, he had the habit, until we wised up to him and his one way 
          cash flow problem. Most everybody else had stopped bothering about trying 
          to get their loans back from Chris but I look after my money like a 
          dingo bitch looks after her cubs: the little prat had owed me five dollars 
          for over a month and I wanted them back. This seemed like my last best 
          chance to see my dough again. If I bailed him up in front of everybody 
          Chris would have no option but to fork out. 
        <p> "Hey, Chris, where's that five bucks you owe me?" I asked loudly. 
        <p> "Uh, hi, Perdita." He started slapping at his pockets as though a 
          red back spider had just scuttled up into his shorts. "Blast, I don't 
          seem to have any small stuff on me." 
        <p> "What a surprise." 
        <p> I hoped it sounded as sarcastic as it was meant to. I guess it did 
          because he looked annoyed at me for having a go at him with so many 
          other people overhearing everything I was saying. 
        <p> "No, tell you what." He produced a TAB betting slip from his top pocket. 
          "How about this in lieu? It's a twelve dollar bet on the Cup and you 
          can take half the winnings if it comes up -- is that cool?" 
        <p> I was surprised he'd given in so easily. But when I looked at the 
          slip I understood why. Sure, it was for a bet on the Cup, but it was 
          a trifecta slip. Which meant that the three horses named on it had to 
          run one, two and three in the order selected to win. No wonder he wanted 
          to fob me off with this useless piece of paper instead a five dollar 
          note. 
        <p> "A trifecta bet? Gee, thanks a lot. This is about as likely to win 
          as Bill Clinton is to go into a monastery." But now I was hoist with 
          my own petard because if I kept on arguing I'd be the one spoiling the 
          afternoon's fun with my bad manners. "OK, we'll call it quits." 
        <p> "Hang on, if that trifecta comes up I'll be down thousands and thousands," 
          Chris said. "I think you should promise to give me a consolation prize 
          if you get a result with it." 
        <p> "What sort of a prize?" 
        <p> He grinned like a schoolboy opening up a showbag: "Promise me you'll 
          do everything I tell you to for one night." 
        <p> Whether it was coincidence or not the voices in the lunch room seemed 
          to go quiet at the exact same moment as he spoke. All the eyes swung 
          towards us. The little bastard was trying to get his own back for the 
          way I'd humiliated him before: what's more he was making a good job 
          of it. The quicker I got rid of him the better. 
        <p> "OK, it's a deal. The chances of me going out with you are about as 
          likely as winning a trifecta in the cup anyway." 
        <p> Chris smiled: "A man never knows his luck in the big city, Perdita. 
          He never knows." 
        <p> He moved off and Lisa, one of my friends, was laughing about the incident. 
          "Gee, Perdita, is your face going to be red if that ticket's a winner!" 
        <p> "Ha! Tell that to ... " I checked the slip. "To <i> 'Paddy's Boy, 
          'Alaric'</i> and <i>'Dear Me'.</i> Maybe you can get them to share the 
          joke by going past the post one after the other." 
        <p> Twenty minutes later Paddy's Boy took out the cup, a nose ahead of 
          Alaric, with Dear Me trampling on Alaric's fetlocks. Bart Cummins had 
          trained his twelfth Cup winner and I'd nearly scored my first heart 
          attack. There were two consolations: the first was when I found out 
          I'd won over six thousand dollars; the second was the look on Chris's 
          face when he realized how much he'd lost by sharing the bet with me. 
          But with the entire office staff listening in to our conversation there 
          was no way he could wheedle out of it. Then he brightened up and walked 
          over to me. There was no background noise at all this time and no way 
          was anybody thinking about getting down to serious drinking until they'd 
          earwigged our conversation. The little bastard was smirking all over 
          his face. 
        <p> "OK, Perdita, make me an offer to let you off your promise. How much 
          will you pay not to go out with me?" 
        <p> "Nothing at all. I don't welch on my bets and you're not getting a 
          single bloody cent more than you're entitled to." 
        <p> That caused uproar all right, all the guys and chicks laughing and 
          applauding. "And in the meantime, you ugly little creep I'll have that 
          slip before you can get a running start with it to the TAB." 
        <p> He shrugged and handed over the betting slip. "You should be nice 
          to me, Perdita. I could have a whole bunch of photos taken of you and 
          me and put on all the notice boards." 
        <p> I gave him my shyest, sweetest, most feminine smile: "Take as many 
          photos as you like, you shit, because I'm taking half of your money." 
        <p> I did as well: the problem was that the only thing anybody wanted 
          to talk, guess and gossip about around the office was <i>'When's the 
          big night - when's it going to happen, guys?'</i>. The arseholes in 
          the claims section even put up a poem about it. I didn't mind the obscenities 
          but I was really pissed at being described as a filly racing with a 
          weight handicap, i.e., too much lead in my fun bags. I crossed out <i>'lead'</i> 
          and wrote <i>'gold'</i> instead. That took the smile off their shit 
          sucking faces. 
        <p> Mind you, I got the smile wiped off my own face on Friday when Chris 
          asked me if I was willing to exchange the night for Saturday afternoon. 
          I asked him what difference it made and he said he'd got a friend of 
          his who was a professional photographer to set up a shooting session 
          for the two of us. The reason he wanted an afternoon shoot was because 
          the rates were cheaper. 
        <p> I guess he was still hoping that the threat of making me perform in 
          front of a camera would be enough to shake a wad of cash out of me. 
          If that was what was on his mind he was sitting on top of the world 
          with a sack of shit around his shoulders because the only way he'd ever 
          get another dollar from me was by prizing it out of my cold, dead fingers. 
          I did agree to trading a night for the afternoon though: at least that 
          way I'd still be able to enjoy my Saturday night out. When I willingly 
          agreed Chris looked baffled. He couldn't believe that I'd willingly 
          pose for horny pictures with somebody who was threatening to show them 
          around the office where I worked. 
        <p> The first answer to that was that if I got the slightest shred of 
          evidence that he'd ever done such a thing I'd swear out a charge of 
          blackmail against him. The second point was that no Aussie is ever going 
          to be censored very much by other Aussies for paying out on a gambling 
          debt: far, far better to be a slut than a welcher. But I wasn't doing 
          one damned thing more than I had to; if Chris was looking for me to 
          play through with a threesome then either he or his photosnapping mate 
          was going to get a camera bounced off his head. 
        <p> "You needn't worry about that, Perdita. Phil is very much into dainty 
          boys, not girls built like Jesse Ventura." 
        <p> "Are you trying to put me down, Chris?" 
        <p> He sneered as though I'd farted at a funeral: "No, all I'm saying 
          is that every time I look at you I remember the old gag about Australian 
          women being the best female impersonators in the world." 
        <p> "Chris, fuck off and get a blood test from the nearest VD clinic. 
          And if they discover you've got leukemia or something else that's fatal 
          let me know straight away so I can phone it through to <i>'Good News 
          Week'</i>." 
        <p> I watched him go with a downcast heart. OK, I was six thousand dollars 
          ahead of the game but when I thought of all the sexy guys in the office 
          I'd have enjoyed being a naughty girl with ... . The story of my life 
          -- I kept dreaming of a super stud and all I ever got was South Park. 
        <p> Anyway, I showed up on time. On time and with a bloodstream well laced 
          with Stolichnaya . If you've got to endure the unendurable the only 
          way to get through it is with plenty of vodka. Ideally, of course, it 
          should be drunk just before you go in front of a firing squad so that 
          the hangover isn't a problem. Well, I wasn't going to get any high velocity 
          weapons pointed at me that afternoon, only a kid's pop gun. 
        <p> Phil sure wasn't going to be any danger. If he'd been a dog he'd have 
          been a toy poodle. Small and bright eyed and yappy with lots of white 
          hair. Why it was white I don't know, he was only thirty or so. Maybe 
          being a photographer had forced him into seeing a lot of things he had 
          never wanted to look at --- like me, for instance. A point of view with 
          which I had no sympathy at all. If I die and get turned away from the 
          gates of paradise I'm going below to ask the devil for the job of spit 
          roasting skinny fashion models and Calista Flockhart -- they've made 
          my life hell so I'd be delighted to return the favor in our respective 
          afterlives. 
        <p> But putting up with Phil's curled lips was nothing compared to the 
          sight of Chris's leer at the sight of me. For some weird reason he'd 
          got a bandanna on his head which had a motif of anti-nuke symbols and 
          the word <i>'PEACE'</i>. 
        <p> "What are you wearing that silly fucking thing for?" 
        <p> He smirked: "It's a message, Perdita. Somehow I seem to have gotten 
          off on the wrong foot with you and I wanted you to know I'd like us 
          to be friends from now on." 
        <p> "Thanks, but I'd rather have you as an enemy -- it's less expensive 
          in non-performing loans." 
        <p> "Women! I put six grand in your kick and you're still whinging about 
          one plastic portrait of the Queen. What the hell, you're a republican 
          anyway." 
        <p> "Guys, guys!" Phil was waving his hands around as though they were 
          butterflies looking for somewhere to land. "I've got to be at a very 
          important wedding on the other side of the harbor by four o'clock. If 
          we're going to do this, can we please get on with it?" 
        <p> "Good idea," Chris said. "Be a nice change for you, Phil, to be snapping 
          a honeymoon instead of a wedding." 
        <p> Phil looked at me, about to say something, then clamped his lips tight 
          on whatever words it was he'd been about to utter. A smart move. Maybe 
          I had to do whatever Chris wanted me to but he hadn't said a word so 
          far about not beating the crap out of this piss-taking picture-taker. 
        <p> "OK, guys, let's get started. Perdita, how about stripping off to 
          the waist and then slipping your jacket back on. We'll start with a 
          shot of you and Chris standing together and smiling for the camera." 
        <p> I gritted my teeth and started the strip tease. As far as Phil was 
          concerned it was all strip and no tease. 
        <p> <img align="left" WIDTH = "323" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Trifecta/Trifimages/cce1b.jpg"> 
        <p> "OK, look at me, Perdita. Chris, you look at Perdita." 
        <p> He aimed the camera at us through the viewfinder, his white hair lit 
          up by the bright lights like an shampoo ad. 
        <p> "No, no, I want smiles. This is supposed to be a fun thing, not a 
          marriage. Perdita, say something to Chris guaranteed to make him look 
          happy." 
        <p> "Sure. Wayne Bobbitt." 
        <p> "I'm going to make you eat those words, Perdita." 
        <p> "Piss off and find a parrot to put on your shoulder." 
        <p> "Yeah, I've always fancied myself as a pirate." 
        <p> "A pirate! You couldn't pirate a Frank Sinatra album." 
        <p> Phil was seriously unimpressed: "People! If you two can't take this 
          seriously I don't see any reason why I should. Perdita, might I suggest 
          that it would help set the scene for romance if you at least put down 
          your handbag. And Chris, why don't you kiss her and show off a discreet 
          little grope?" 
        <p> Chris chuckled: "There's so much hanging loose I don't know where 
          to start." 
        <p> "For God's sake, start wherever you start at any love in." 
        <p> "A love in! With Chris?" I sneered. "It's a lot more likely to be 
          a let down." 
        <p> "Keep your mouth closed," Chris snarled. "And that's an order." 
        <p> <img align="right" WIDTH = "374" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Trifecta/Trifimages/be2zb.jpg"> 
        <p> So I did as he told me, but it wasn't easy; the Stolichnaya must have 
          started vaporizing or something inside my brain by then because as Chris 
          nuzzled my ear and touched one of my tits I felt like bursting out into 
          an fit of giggles. Maybe it was having the camera pointed at me, or 
          maybe it was just the sheer silliness of the situation, having a prat 
          like Chris trying to get me panting with passion. 
        <p> Phil wasn't happy though: "Look, Chris, you might have warned me your 
          girl friend was going to show up half pissed. Taking portraits of drunks 
          is a job for the blue heelers." 
        <p> "She'll be alright. What next?" 
        <p> "Sit her down on the couch before she falls down and then you sit 
          behind her. If you think really hard perhaps you can find something 
          you'd like to do then." 
        <p> <img align="left" WIDTH = "324" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Trifecta/Trifimages/hcmyb.jpg"> 
        <p> Chris got close up behind so I was leaning back onto him and put his 
          hands under my boobs. "Here, let me take the weight off your chest for 
          a while." 
        <p> He started doing a kind of combined juggling and weight judging effort 
          with both hands as Phil played around with the camera. That was alright, 
          but when my self invited partner started his heavy breathing routine 
          in my ear again it set me off snorting through my nose with uncontrollable 
          laughter. Between us it sounded like a pod of whales surfacing for an 
          air break. I wasn't really trying to spoil Chris's fun, it was the mix 
          of nerves and booze. Still, I could understand why he started whinging. 
        <p> "Bloody oath, Perdita, trying to turn you on is about as much fun 
          as making a pass at Roseanne." 
        <p> Phil sighed: "Take her jacket off and give her some mouth to mouth 
          resuscitation. Maybe that'll do some good." 
        <p> It could have been worse, I thought. Chris was a repulsive little 
          turd of a male but at least he was ahead of forty per cent of the men 
          I knew in sexual attractiveness simply by being a non-smoker. Tonguing 
          a smoker is as much fun as licking a saliva soaked nicotine patch. 
        <p> <img align="right" WIDTH = "383" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Trifecta/Trifimages/stukb.jpg"> 
        <p> What surprised both of us -- me, anyway -- was that once I started 
          frenching with Chris everything suddenly seemed to turn around. I enjoyed 
          having his tongue in my mouth and feeling his hands tugging away at 
          my nipples as though they were Nintendo play stations. I even found 
          myself holding his head against me as I wriggled around on top of the 
          couch. 
        <p> "That's more like it, people," Phil encouraged. "Passion, energy, 
          that's what a photographer needs to work with." 
        <p> For God's sake, he was taking a few quick porno pictures at cut rate 
          prices, not shooting the Kama Sutra with Kidman and Cruise. What next, 
          a display in the National Gallery; <i>"Seventies retrospective: Hippie 
          has it away with big fat bird"?</i> 
        <p> "Chris, perhaps you'd like to help Perdita out of her clothes?" 
        <p> At least he knew my name. That hasn't always been the case with some 
          of the men who've seen me served up <i>au naturale</i>. 
        <p> <img align="left" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Trifecta/Trifimages/xvjkb.jpg"> 
        <p> Thankfully, I'd at least stopped giggling. Schoolgirls giggle when 
          they're having their panties pulled off: grown women should simply smile 
          graciously and wave politely to the onlookers, if such there be. Chris 
          had a wide smile on his lips, which I couldn't understand. 
        <p> "What are you so happy about? I can't see anything there that's worth 
          six thousand bucks: not to you, anyway." 
        <p> "At least I got six thousand as well and the chance to shut your big 
          mouth up in the best possible way. You've got to take what life offers 
          and make the best of it, Perdita. And I foresee that what's coming straight 
          towards you right now is the flying fickle finger of fate." 
        <p> He stood up, dropped his jeans, went over to a table and opened a 
          drawer, taking out a cock shaped vibrator. "You'll like this," he said. 
          "It's solar powered." 
        <p> "Solar powered?" 
        <p> "That's right. It's designed for women like you who think the sun 
          shines out of their arses." 
        <p> "Chris, if it's a choice of being raped or having to listen to your 
          jokes, for God's sake start banging away." 
        <p> "Don't worry about that, darling, I'll soon have you laughing, one 
          way or another."

        <p> As a prediction it wasn't too far out. Maybe I wasn't outright laughing 
          but I soon smiling. Chris totally surprised me: most guys know as much 
          about the fine art of fine tuning pussies as I do about ballet dancing 
          but the vibrator and his finger had my box de-frosted in no time -- 
          damp, empty and ready for the weekly meat delivery. 
        <p> "Not laughing now, are you, Perdita?" 
        <p> "Give me a chance; I haven't seen your cock at full stretch yet." 
        <p> "Well, I bet you haven't seen your cunt for years, judging by the 
          size of your tits." 
        <p> "At least I have seen one before, which is probably more than you 
          have." 
        <p> Phil was almost ready to stamp his foot in anger: "I would really 
          appreciate if we could get down to business here. " 
        <p> "Going down now," Chris said cheerfully. "Don't forget the diver, 
          folks. If I'm not back in a week just put up a sign <i>'At the bottom 
          of this hole lies a big, big man.'</i> 
        <p> <img align="left" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340"  hspace="10"  border="2" src="Trifecta/Trifimages/x3n8b.jpg"> 
        <p> I was going to say something to him but somehow I couldn't, not when 
          he pushed the vibrator in further and squeezed my clit against the wet 
          plastic. "Uuuuuuh" was about all I could manage because never before 
          had I felt so much action coming from a set of batteries. It felt as 
          if I was plugged into the mains with the metering needles spinning around. 
        <p> "How about taking a shot over my shoulder?" I heard Chris say. "This 
          has to be her best feature right here." 
        <p> If I hadn't been enjoying what he was doing so much I'd have told 
          him he'd have looked ugly in a pack of rottweilers. Then I decided he 
          was more of a lap dog because he'd found a far better use for his tongue 
          than talking crap with it. 
        <p> <img align="right" WIDTH = "522" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Trifecta/Trifimages/gw6cb.jpg"> 
        <p> "That's more like it, guys, that's what I'm looking for." I could 
          hear the lens mechanism on Phil's camera clicking away like a papperazzi 
          at a Mick Jagger ex-girlfriends' convention. 
        <p> I was starting to pop off as well, what with the Stoli, the vibrator 
          and Chris's mouth all working away at me. He might have been a joke 
          to start with but now I was stroking his head to show how much I was 
          enjoying his lovemaking. Maybe I'd seriously underestimated the guy. 
          Maybe what was turning me on as well were the bright lights all around 
          and knowing that everything we were doing was being photographed. 
        <p> "OK, Chris, sit on her boobs and get her to lick your balls." 
        <p> Chris lifted up his head, laughing: "I'll try but the last time I 
          saw anybody riding anything with humps as big as that was on a camel 
          at Alice Springs." 
        <p> "You can't shut up can you?" I snapped. "Jeez, Chris, you're a whinging 
          bastard." 
        <p> <img align="left" WIDTH = "434" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Trifecta/Trifimages/tuqzb.jpg"> 
        <p> He stood astride me, squatted down on top of my tits and lifted my 
          head up: "Get on with it, Ms executive secretary. This has cost me a 
          lot of money so make it good, or I really will whinge." 
        <p> OK, I'd said I'd do whatever he told me to and I did, licking around 
          his tightly wrinkled balls and the base of his shaft with long strokes 
          of my tongue. In fact I enjoyed listening to Chris's gasps of pleasure 
          and feeling the hot skin of his inner thighs rubbing against my tingling 
          nipples. 
        <p> Phil moved in closer: "She looks a lot like Fergie from this angle." 
        <p> "Uh: you should see her strutting around at work. She thinks she's 
          more important than any royal." 
        <p> Which was only Chris getting in a cheap shot. I've never bought tickets 
          in myself, not at work or anywhere else. And just to prove it I started 
          licking around the flange on his shaft. I could taste salt as though 
          he'd come straight out of the surf and feel all those little clusters 
          of nerve endings which love that kind of treatment. 
        <p> <img align="right" WIDTH = "404" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Trifecta/Trifimages/f79vb.jpg"> 
        <p> Chris returned the favor by reaching back and playing with my cunt. 
          He went inside me like a baker's fingers sinking into wet dough, my 
          clit already in self-raising mode even before they helped it along again. 
          Phil stood up to take another shot of us. 
        <p> "That's good, people, that's good. If you ever want to a bit of professional 
          porn, Perdita, let me know." 
        <p> Chris giggled: "I think he means he wants you to take on a football 
          team, plus the coach." 
        <p> "You think she could do that?" 
        <p> <img align="left" WIDTH = "478" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Trifecta/Trifimages/ebrtb.jpg"> 
        <p> Chris's hand moved around inside my pussy, moving in and out and I 
          groaned with pleasure. 
        <p> "Maybe you should be thinking about a cricket team: she seems to like 
          playing on a sticky wicket." 
        <p> "Yeah, a couple of West Indian fast bowlers would do the job. Anything 
          but the Poms, hey? If they screw as well as they play cricket she'd 
          get a lot more ducks than fucks." 
        <p> Both of the idiots laughed. "Can I have a set of prints by Monday 
          morning, Phil? I want to put them on her desk." 
        <p> "You should be putting them in the jobs done tray by then, I'd guess. 
          Hey, if you two ever decide to get married, I'll give you a special 
          deal on the wedding photos." 
        <p> "Marry Perdita! She'll never be that lucky." 
        <p> "No fucking way," I told them both, even if I did have to mumble it 
          around Phil's cock. 
        <p> "Give her a chance," Phil urged. "Chris, just lie back and let Perdita 
          do a slave girl routine for you. It's for her own good, she's got to 
          learn how to be nice to men if she's ever going to get one of her own." 
        <p> "Phil, the only way this girl will get a man is if they have a disposal 
          sale down at the Salvation Army hostel. Still, I don't mind giving her 
          a chance to improve herself." 
        <p> <img align="right" WIDTH = "347" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Trifecta/Trifimages/stwab.jpg"> 
        <p> Chris got off me and leaned back holding his cock steady. "OK, Ms 
          Bossy boots, give it some of your big mouth." 
        <p> Even with the money I'd made on this deal it was getting to be a long 
          afternoon. But I did as he wanted, twisting myself around to lap on 
          his cock as Phil took more photos and I sweated -- photography by Phil 
          and lighting by Spielberg. At least that's what it felt like. I was 
          as hot as Christmas day on the beach. 
        <p> "I don't understand your problem here, Chris. She seems an obedient 
          enough to me." 
        <p> "With hair that color? Listen, if I wasn't here to control her she'd 
          be bouncing you off the walls by now. Do me a favor, Phil, and stop 
          rattling her cage." 
        <p> <img align="left" WIDTH = "520" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Trifecta/Trifimages/41qgb.jpg"> 
        <p> Chris leaned back against my legs and slapped me on the rump: "Right, 
          you big bitch, get your head down lower and start sucking properly." 
        <p> He was right, if it hadn't been for my promise to do as I was told 
          both of those guys would have soon been feeling like lost tourists in 
          Jurassic Park. The only thing stopping me from gritting my teeth in 
          anger was that Chris's cock was between them and even so it was a bloody 
          close run thing. Especially with him lounging around looking like a 
          Sultan visiting his harem. Once this afternoon was over I'd pay him 
          back for all this, one way or another. 
        <p> Phil put a camera on a small tripod at the end of the couch. "OK, 
          Perdita, let's get down to the job big time. Start giving Chris a really 
          thorough blow job." 
        <p> <img align="right" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Trifecta/Trifimages/lt2zb.jpg"> 
        <p> Well, I didn't have a problem with that, especially if it developed 
          into a sixty nine. Oral sex with Chris was no problem: all our hangups 
          were with oral communication. It would have been easier though without 
          an alarm clock suddenly starting to buzz away as I got onto the deep 
          throat strokes. 
        <p> "Sorry, folks, but that's it. I've got to shoot through now if I'm 
          going to get to the wedding on time. Chris, you two can manage from 
          now on, I guess. Make sure you lock up when you leave. Bye." 
        <p> Phil started draping camera bags around himself then scuttled for 
          the door. "Get your arse back here!" Chris yelped. 
        <p> "Sorry, can't be helped, Chris. But if you end up with a kid I'll 
          take all the christening pictures free and gratis. Can't say fairer 
          than that, can I? TTFN, and have fun. "
