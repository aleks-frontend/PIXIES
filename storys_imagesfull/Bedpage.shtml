                <P> It was a friend of mine called Perdita who first introduced 
                  me to Chris. Apparently they'd been involved in some kind of 
                  a betting thing at their office and Perdita had won a lot of 
                  money. But in return she'd rashly agreed to do whatever Chris 
                  wanted her to do. She told me how he'd taken her to a photographer 
                  friend of his and done the whole porn thing with Perdita in 
                  front of a camera. She seemed to have enjoyed the experience 
                  a hell of a lot and dated Chris a few times afterwards, but 
                  they soon went their own ways. Which left Chris and I as mutual 
                  acquaintances, if not friends. He also lost no time in making 
                  it plain that he was eager to get me in the same place as he'd 
                  taken Perdita, and for the same reason. Which kind of left me 
                  stuck between two bases. 
                <P> I've always been a boringly well behaved Catholic girl. Oh, 
                  I've had boyfriends and done the usual things with them, but 
                  always very discreetly. Call me a career girl who puts work 
                  before fun, dresses very quietly and leaves early from any party 
                  which looks as if it might be getting out of hand. Which is 
                  the way I am -- most of the time. But I was starting to get 
                  a feeling that maybe I was missing out on a really deep and 
                  exciting part of life. The sort of excitement which sometimes 
                  made me tremble when I imagined being with Chris and being forced 
                  to make love with another man watching us do it. 
                <P> Well, when somebody starts getting as curious as that about 
                  how they'd react to something, they eventually find themselves 
                  being drawn towards it. Like a fish to a lure -- and Chris was 
                  just the sort of guy to keep dangling the hook in the water 
                  as long as he thought he had a chance. He knew where I had my 
                  lunch break and hung around a lot talking to me. I guess he 
                  was looking for my weak spot, and he found it. 
                <P> As soon as I told him I was a one eyed Essendon supporter 
                  he began to follow up on it, offering bets on football matches 
                  and always in the same way. He wanted to bet on Essendon's opponents 
                  and for me to back the Bombers. No money changed hands, we just 
                  let it ride until nearly the end of the season. Which wasn't 
                  a good one for Essendon. Much as I and all the other fans barracked 
                  for them, they seemed to lose a lot of games. Maybe by only 
                  a behind or two, but enough to set the other mob singing their 
                  victory song in the showers. And as the Bombers kept bombing 
                  out the money I owed to Chris began to get serious. Which was 
                  when he offered me a forfeit or nothing deal. 
                <P> "What kind of a forfeit?" I asked him and he smiled. 
                <P> "You've talked to Perdita about me a few times. I guess you 
                  know what happened to her. So it's the same deal for you. If 
                  the Bombers beat the Dockers, you don't owe me a cent. If the 
                  Dockers do the Bombers you front up for a little photo session. 
                  Nothing too way out but enough to make your next visit to a 
                  the confession box more interesting than it usually is. How 
                  about it?" 
                <P> What the hell, I didn't want to pay him what I owed -- it 
                  would have taken some of the jam off my budget for a while. 
                  And the Fremantle Dockers were the worse team in the AFL. There 
                  was no way they'd ever run out victors over the Bombers, not 
                  even an off form Bombers side. Not unless God himself wanted 
                  Chris to have me. 
                <P> I couldn't believe that game, not even though I was there 
                  watching it happen. Essendon played as though they'd spent all 
                  night travelling on a Greyhound bus and the Dockers ... the 
                  Dockers came out of the tunnel like it was lions versus christians 
                  day at the Coliseum and they were the ones with the claws. It 
                  wasn't even a game, more like a gangland execution. At first 
                  turn the Bombers were already fifteen points down and about 
                  as committed as Warren Beatty at a gay pride convention. At 
                  half time the Bombers coach went out with his team thirty eight 
                  points down and gave the players some emotionally charged advice. 
                  He was juggling a ball in his hands all the time he was shouting, 
                  so maybe he was making sure they realized it wasn't round and 
                  they weren't playing soccer. Or maybe he just wanted to show 
                  that at least one member of the squad was trying. 
                <P> Me, I was wondering if Chris had somehow fixed the whole match 
                  or was just very lucky. Anyway, whatever had happened, there 
                  was no way the Dockers wouldn't lapse back into the usual Freo 
                  Shockers after half time: they'd go into their usual slow motion 
                  mode and the Bombers big men would fly ... 
                <P> Ha! The Essendon attackers went after their marks like wet 
                  hens trying to fly in a thunderstorm and the Dockers came off 
                  the turf as though they'd been taking Magic Johnson pills. Three 
                  quarter time, Freo ahead by fifty four, the Bombers fans groaning 
                  in despair, and the only happy faces in the terrace were the 
                  dozen Docker barrackers who'd flown across the continent to 
                  watch this match and were beginning to think it was one of the 
                  best investments in their lives. But as happy as they were, 
                  I knew that in front of a TV screen not too far away was an 
                  even happier face -- and I knew who it belonged to. And at the 
                  final siren, the Dockers winners by twelve goals and four behinds, 
                  there was no need to ask for whom the bell tolled. It tolled 
                  for me, on my mobile, with Chris's smug tones asking when might 
                  be a convenient time for me to cover my gambling debts. Or, 
                  in this case, to get covered for them.

                      <p> Which is why I was lying on a bed in a strange apartment with 
                  a strange man taking photos of me in unreal lingerie, and waiting 
                  for Chris to enter from stage right as the leading man in this 
                  little drama. I had no idea what he was going to be wearing, 
                  or not wearing, but I was slightly nervous about the whole thing. 
                  If slightly nervous is the correct way to describe a situation 
                  where I kept expecting for divine intervention to stop me committing 
                  the same sins that Adam and Eve got thrown out of paradise for. 
                  There's no doubt about it, a Catholic education lays down strict 
                  rules on sex as fun -- nun yesterday, nun today, and nun tomorrow. 
                <P> "Everything cool, Tami?" Phil asked me. 
                <P> He was a small, middle aged guy with oversized spectacles 
                  and a silly ponytail of gray hair hanging from underneath a 
                  balding head. But at least he seemed very professional and cool, 
                  which was a big help. He also had the sort of good taste in 
                  interior decorating which I'd never acquire in a million years. 
                <P> "Yes, I think so." 
                <P> I just wished my voice sounded more confident than it did, 
                  or that I hadn't just noticed the book I was pretending to read 
                  was upside down. It would also have helped not to hear Chris 
                  suppressing a spurt of laughter from the doorway on the other 
                  side of the room. But at least I managed to control myself enough 
                  not to look up as I felt him moving closer. 
                      <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "360" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Bed/Bedimages/6dq9.jpg"> 
                      <P> "Well, hello, Tina, fancy meeting you. Are you going to come 
                  here often?" Chris gurgled with laughter at his own wit. "You 
                  can put the book down now, I'll keep you entertained for a while." 
                <P> He knelt down on the side of the bed and rubbed one of his 
                  palms gently against my shoulder. I felt awkward, more or less 
                  sitting on my hands and feeling about the same way as I had 
                  when I was ten and waiting to be called up on stage to get an 
                  award for regular Sunday School attendance. A sort of frozen 
                  smile of terminal shyness. And I wished I knew how I was supposed 
                  to react to the silly mask he was wearing. He might at least 
                  have warned me he was going to play dress-up as well. 
                <P> "I don't know why you've got that silly thing on for. The 
                  only people around here who need to hide their faces are stupid 
                  Essendon supporters like me." 
                <p> Chris laughed: "Don't be impatient, you'll soon meet the fate 
                  your bad judgement deserves. Let me show you something I put 
                  under the pillow as a suitable treatment for losing fans." 
                <P> He took out two rings covered in blue fur and I stared at 
                  them, wondering what they were. Until I saw the glint of the 
                  steel inside them and the chain between both of the rings and 
                  I realized they were handcuffs. Then I really began trembling. 
                <P> "I don't suppose I have to ask what you're going to do with 
                  them?" 
                      <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "237" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Bed/Bedimages/j2zu.jpg"> 
                      <p> "No, Tami, there's no point at all. Because I'm going to give 
                  you a little touch of a bondage experience while you're being 
                  stripped off for the camera. Because that's the sort of thing 
                  that happens to losers like you." 
                <P> "I didn't lose, that useless bloody footie team did," I snapped 
                  back. "They're the ones who should be getting locked up." 
                <P> "Morally, you may be right, Tami. But you're much more fun 
                  to chain to a bed, so I don't want any more arguments. Just 
                  put your arms up beside your head and get comfortable because 
                  you're going to be in the same position for a while." 
                <P> I still couldn't take it on board that it was really happening, 
                  not even when the steel rings underneath the fur were snapped 
                  shut around my wrists. Only when I tried to move my arms again 
                  and found them trapped behind the bed head did it finally sink 
                  in that this was it. Bondage, restraint -- call it what you 
                  liked, it meant that I was helpless to stop Chris doing whatever 
                  he wanted with me. 
                      <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "299" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Bed/Bedimages/vvkt.jpg"> 
                      <p> Phil moved closer to the bed with his camera up to his face. 
                  "Can we open things up a wee bit here?" 
                <P> I didn't know what he meant but Chris nodded. "Sure. Right, 
                  slut, open your legs and show yourself off. We want to see how 
                  fuckable you can look when you try." 
                <P> His voice suddenly sounded sharp and angry and I felt I had 
                  to obey, shyly moving my legs apart as Phil aimed his camera 
                  at the trashy tart's knickers I'd had to put on with the lingerie. 
                <P> "There's a good little girl," Chris said, his voice less emotional. 
                  "You just keep on doing exactly as you're told and we'll have 
                  a good time." 
                <P> Then he began undoing the ribbons on my top. "Time to show 
                  off your tits, Tami. Time to show them off and have them felt, 
                  and that's what I'm going to do. I can do whatever I like with 
                  you now. All you get to do is to say 'yes, sir' and 'no, sir'. 
                  And that's what you've been waiting for, isn't it?" 
                <p> "That's not true." 
                <P> Chris shook his head as if he couldn't believe what he was 
                  hearing: "Whatever you say, bimbo. It doesn't make any difference 
                  now, anyway. So let's see what we've got here." 
                <P> His fingers touched my bare midriff and I trembled as they 
                  slid around me and pulled at the thin nylon. It hadn't been 
                  more than a token covering anyway but even that was gone as 
                  Chris pulled the scanty material up over my breasts and left 
                  the folds around my mouth. 
                      <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Bed/Bedimages/reu2.jpg"> 
                      <p> "Now that's the kind of sight that would make a nice bonus 
                  for any hard working burglar," Chris gloated. "The lady of the 
                  house on her back on the family bed, all nicely handcuffed and 
                  tits on offer for some good hard handling." 
                <P> I trembled again as his hand gently stroked the side of my 
                  body, just below my right boob. 
                <P> "What's the matter, Tami, getting a little nervous are you? 
                  Not to worry, the next step along is easy." 
                <P> The bed creaked as he changed position and lowered his head 
                  over me. The ceiling somehow suddenly seemed a lot higher and 
                  the light brighter. It was a feeling like being in a dentist's 
                  chair, more than a little frightened of what was going to happen 
                  and with all my attention focused on my own body and the person 
                  touching it. Whatever Phil was seeing or doing was beyond my 
                  caring about right then. 
                      <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "485" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Bed/Bedimages/mmmw.jpg"> 
                      <p> Yet Chris was right: when he put his tongue against one either 
                  of my aureoles and drew it over and around the hardening point 
                  I was feeling no pain at all. In fact I could feel myself starting 
                  to get damp straight away. Chris must have heard the deep breaths 
                  I was starting to take and took both of my nipples inside his 
                  mouth very quickly at the same time as he tweaked the top of 
                  my panties. 
                <P> "These'll soon be coming off, Tami. By and by it'll be just 
                  your stockings left on. First things first though." 
                <P> He opened a drawer by the bed, took out a key and unlocked 
                  one of the handcuff rings long enough to slip my arm out of 
                  the clinging nylon. I didn't struggle or try to escape, I let 
                  myself be positioned like a shop window dummy as Chris secured 
                  me again, and then loosened my other wrist to finish the job. 
                  Very soon I was chained at both wrists again and with nothing 
                  on except the whore's drawers and the pair of stockings I'd 
                  been made to wear. 
                      <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Bed/Bedimages/96sg.jpg"> 
                      <P> Both men were staring at my exposed tits now, Phil through 
                  the viewfinder of his camera as he moved closer and Chris with 
                  his fingers held open above them. But that wasn't for long at 
                  all, just a moment of anticipation before he took me in both 
                  hands and began kneading the soft flesh. 
                <P> "That's what I call a nice pair, he gloated. "What do you 
                  reckon, Phil, are we getting some good shots here?" 
                <P> "Now that you mention it, no. She's still too tensed up. You 
                  need to get her laughing." 
                <P> "What do you want me to do -- pull a funny face?" 
                <P> "You've already got one. No, just tickle the bottom of he 
                  feet -- that always works." 
                <P> "No, don't!" I squealed. I hate having that done to me. But 
                  it seemed like a useless protest. Chris got off the bed and 
                  lifted up one of my legs. 
                      <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "378" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Bed/Bedimages/tv58.jpg"> 
                      <p> "What's the matter, Tami, don't you like being tickled?" 
                <P> "No, it drives me mad!" 
                <P> He ran his fingertips along the sole of my raised foot. "OK, 
                  Cinderella, let's see a smile from you then, if you don't want 
                  one forced out of you." 
                <P> So I smiled, and then I asked: "Why don't you take my panties 
                  off instead?" 
                <P> "Well, as opposed to trying to fuck you while you're still 
                  wearing them, that seems like a good idea." 
                <P> He reached down to touch me between the legs and I gave a 
                  little gasp of pleasure. 
                <P> "Quite sure you don't want these on anymore?" 
                <P> "No ... I don't want them," I told him. 
                      <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "411" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Bed/Bedimages/q7yd.jpg"> 
                      <p> "Just the sort of girl I like to meet -- one that's not underwear 
                  retentive." 
                <P> He caught hold of the panties' waistband, then pulled them 
                  down from where they had been to around my thighs. It wasn't 
                  the first time a man had done that for me, but it was sure the 
                  first time it had happened while I was locked to the bed, and 
                  by God, it was exciting. 
                <P> "Do you do this to all your girl friends?" I asked Chris. 
                  "Chain them up before you make love to them?" 
                <P> "I don't make love to friends of any kind. I don't have friends. 
                  What I do is to fuck girls. Find them, feel them, fuck them 
                  and forget them -- that's my motto. Especially the ones who 
                  are so dumb they don't even know when they're supporting a bunch 
                  of losers." 
                <P> "No wonder you like wearing a mask, you bandit." 
                <P> "Well, it's more than you'll soon be wearing, cunt. Open wide 
                  again and show off your pussy." 
                      <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "370" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Bed/Bedimages/fj97.jpg"> 
                      <P> I didn't know how I felt. Partly excited at the thought of 
                  being photographed in the raw for anybody who saw the pixs to 
                  ogle, partly ashamed at having Chris's hand stroking my tits 
                  and snatch like I was some kind of a slave girl. But at least 
                  that wasn't something I needed to worry about because there 
                  was nothing at all I could do about it. And when a set of fingertips 
                  ran up and down my clit as though it was a piano key I had no 
                  doubt at all about how much I enjoyed it. 
                <P> "Looks like there's a need here for some good vibrations," 
                  Chris commented. "How about it, Phil?" 
                <P> "Help yourself from the drawer," Phil answered. "I think you'll 
                  need the large economy size." 
                <P> My lover/rapist laughed and opened the drawer, then took out 
                  a vibrator which he fooled around with, holding it up and looking 
                  along it as if he was checking out a billiard cue. 
                <P> "Yep, seems straight. Nothing worse than a bent shafter, it 
                  makes the ladies all twisted and bitter. Mind you, this one 
                  must be about due for its hundred cunt service. That right, 
                  Phil?" 
                <P> "It's certainly been in plenty of tight corners, that's for 
                  sure." 
                <P> Both of them grinned at each other, and then Chris bent over 
                  me. But I was surprised to find him undoing the cuffs instead 
                  of using the vibrator. 
                <P> "You're letting me go?" I asked. 
                <P> "You're going nowhere. I just want everybody who sees these 
                  shots to know that you wanted this thing used on you." 
                      <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Bed/Bedimages/km8t.jpg"> 
                      <p> Then he did pick up the device and begin to explore between 
                  my opened thighs with it. He was right, I didn't want him to 
                  stop, but it was still humiliating to see Phil coming closer 
                  and closer with the camera. 
                <P> "Smile, please, Tami." 
                <P> I covered my face with my hand in embarrassment and squealed. 
                  Maybe the squeal was outrage in being photographed with a love 
                  machine being pushed up my snatch, or perhaps it was because 
                  of how far Chris had pushed it. 
                <P> "No point in being shy now," Phil said. "Chris, put her down 
                  on the other end of the bed where the light is better." 
                <P> Chris made me get up and move around as Phil wanted. My legs 
                  were trembling but not because I really wanted to walk away 
                  from this scene on them. 
                      <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "512" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Bed/Bedimages/y64c.jpg"> 
                      <p> "That's better," Phil commented as Chris began stroking me 
                  with the vibrator again. "She's starting to look as if she's 
                  enjoying it." 
                <P> "She's thinking about the fucking I'm going to give her, hey, 
                  Tami?" 
                <P> Yes, I was, but not as much as I was thinking of what a good 
                  job he was doing in sliding that tingling tip around my eager 
                  cunt. 
                <P> "Come on, Tami, let's see a smile", Phil urged me again. "Think 
                  about the first really good sex you ever had." 
                <P> "Yeah, and then tell us about it," Chris said. 
                      <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Bed/Bedimages/mju8.jpg"> 
                      <p> I couldn't help grinning like a fool at the memory. "I was 
                  at high school and my boyfriend was desperate for me to bring 
                  my field hockey uniform on a date and change into it. He said 
                  that every time he'd seen me play in the school team it turned 
                  him on. There was nobody at his house that day so we went there 
                  and I got changed into the uniform like he wanted me to." 
                <P> Chris nodded and pressed the vibrator gently up against my 
                  swollen clit: "And was he turned on?" 
                <P> "Oh, yes, he was nearly beside himself. I think it was all 
                  to do with the short skirt and the long socks." 
                <P> "You didn't take your hockey stick with you to beat him off?" 
                <P> "No, I didn't", I admitted wryly. "To tell the truth, I told 
                  him I hadn't put my panties back on after I'd changed. That 
                  was when he started to get really interested." 
                      <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Bed/Bedimages/vdcz.jpg"> 
                      <p> "You could probably remember some more details with the right 
                  encouragement," Phil suggested. "Tami, maybe you could kneel 
                  down at the end of the bed and let Chris get into position." 
                <P> I wasn't quite sure what he meant but I soon caught on when 
                  Chris lay down in front of me and put his head between my stocking 
                  tops. 
                <P> "Move on up and do some lip dancing with me, sweetie. And 
                  while I'm wagging my tongue you can wag yours about what you 
                  did with your sports fan." 
                <P> I moved forward on my knees, my hands resting on his chest, 
                  and giggling like a schoolgirl at the back of a unruly class: 
                  "Me? I didn't do anything with him. He did it all, chasing me 
                  around the house trying to get his hand up my skirt." 
                      <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Bed/Bedimages/uu4w.jpg"> 
                      <p> Chris's hands were creeping up inside my legs, and then I 
                  wriggled as his thumbs pulled my cunt lips wide apart. 
                <P> "What happened then?" Phil asked. 
                <P> "I was ahead for the first lap but he won by a short head 
                  on the second time around." 
                <P> Chris chortled and touched me with his tongue. Phil moved 
                  out of my sight as he took a position behind me to photograph 
                  what Chris was doing. Which seemed to be nothing, until Phil 
                  dropped a hint. 
                <P> "Don't leave us in suspense, Tami. Where did he catch up with 
                  you." 
                <P> "At the kitchen table -- on top of the kitchen table. It was 
                  all very unhygienic, I suppose." 
                <P> "Did he eat you on your kitchen table?" Phil wanted to know. 
                <P> "Yes -- and he sprinkled some chicken salt on my cunt first 
                  because he said it would make it taste better." 
                <P> Phil erupted with a sharp burst of laughter and Chris heaved 
                  underneath me, sputtering like a surfacing whale. 
                      <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Bed/Bedimages/ou92.jpg"> 
                      <P> "You can suck my cock with salt on it if you like, but no 
                  vinegar. How about it?" 
                <P> "I'll take a taste and make up my mind," I said to him. 
                <P> Phil came back towards me, quickly, almost tripping over a 
                  electric cable in his haste to get his camera in my face. My 
                  shyness seemed to be disappearing under the effects of Chris's 
                  lapping tongue like melting ice cream because I waited until 
                  Phil was ready before I put Chris's prick into my mouth. 
                <P> "Nice one, Tami, nice one. Now how about the two of you really 
                  getting to know each other better? Let's have some good one 
                  on one sex here, folks." 
                      <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Bed/Bedimages/curd.jpg"> 
                      <p> Phil turned up the lighting a notch, I sucked on Chris's cock 
                  and now at I didn't have to imagine what Perdita had done with 
                  him because I was doing exactly the same sort of things. 
                <P> What was odd was how smoothly I'd gone through the scruples 
                  barrier: respectable business girl to harlot in about fifteen 
                  minutes from a lying start. Of course I owed it all to Chris 
                  being a totally unscrupulous bastard but I'd known that much 
                  about him all along. 
                <P> "Not bad, not bad," I heard Phil say. "Now let's try something 
                  else, hey?" 
                <P> "Got any ideas?" Chris asked. At least I think that was what 
                  he said, it was hard to tell, his voice was pretty muffled. 
                      <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "254" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Bed/Bedimages/272u.jpg"> 
                      <p> Anyway, Phil did have an idea, the idea of me sucking Chris 
                  off strongly with him holding onto my hair to make sure I made 
                  a good job of the blow job. 
                <P> "Well, Tami, what a lovely little sucker you've turned out 
                  to be," Chris chortled. "My favorite kind of girl -- dumb as 
                  shit but with a big mouth." 
                <P> I did consider giving him at least a gentle bite but I knew 
                  I'd get hurt right back if I tried anything like that so instead 
                  I concentrated on getting his hot cock as far down my throat 
                  as I could. And Phil took plenty of pictures of everything that 
                  was going down -- way down. 
                <P> "I wonder if she's still got that field hockey uniform?" 
                <P> "Don't worry, she'll find one if it means doing this again. 
                  She's getting as horny as hell thinking of what these pictures 
                  of her are going to look like. And now I'm going to get her 
                  ready for them." 
                <P> Chris made me kneel down on the bed facing the camera with 
                  him behind me. And then his fingers began caressing my wet cunt 
                  lips. 
                <p> "OK, Tami, are you ready to be fucked now?" 
                      <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Bed/Bedimages/hrbd.jpg"> 
                      <P> "Oh God, yes!" 
                <P> His other hand slid around underneath me and tugged on a swollen 
                  nipple. 
                <P> "How about if I take you the way you are? You want to be ridden 
                  from behind with a nice big cock ramming into you?" 
                <P> "Come on, Chris, you know what I want, please ... you can 
                  feel me dripping ... " 
                <P> "Let's have a nice big smile for the camera then. And hot 
                  little fillies who want mounting need a bridle." 
                <P> I didn't understand what he meant, not even when he was rolling 
                  the stockings down to my knees and off my legs. It wasn't until 
                  one of the stockings was pulled tight into my mouth that I realized 
                  what Chris meant about a bridle. 
                      <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "349" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Bed/Bedimages/fte7.jpg"> 
                      <p> The son of a bitch kept my head pulled back as he slapped 
                  me hard on each cheek before putting his shaft where I needed 
                  it, and even then he kept teasing me centimeter by centimeter. 
                  I guess he enjoyed showing that not only was I under his control 
                  but he also had more self control than I possessed. 
                <P> "Right, you bitch, you've been wanting this ever since you 
                  heard how I fucked your friend in front of a camera. Nod your 
                  head and it's all yours!" 
                <P> I jerked my head as much as I could against the restraining 
                  stocking and Chris slid himself all the way into me. If I hadn't 
                  been gagged so effectively I would have screamed with joy. 
                <P> And there I was, exactly as Chris had said I would be, letting 
                  him fuck me with plenty of photos still to be taken to prove 
                  that I could be as low down a slut as any other girl when I 
                  wanted to be. And I was loving every second of it, even more 
                  so when Phil took the stocking out of my mouth. Then I was able 
                  to gasp for breath and call out Chris's name in encouragement.

                      <p> I seemed to be motivating Phil as well. He was busy with the 
                  camera, as usual, but away on one side and I couldn't understand 
                  exactly what he was doing, not having any attention to spare 
                  as Chris and I rutted away like wild animals. Only later on 
                  did I find out that he'd been taking some shots of us in a mirror. 
                <P> "I thought perhaps you'd like something with a nice romantic 
                  touch, seeing that the pair of you were getting along so well," 
                  he explained. "Just in case you wanted something nice to send 
                  home to your mother." 
                <P> "I don't think my mother would be interested in this sort 
                  of scene," I told the guys. "She doesn't follow football at 
                  all."
