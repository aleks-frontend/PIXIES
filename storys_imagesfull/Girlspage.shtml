            <p> I met Gale for the first time in the elevator of the building 
              I work in. I was a secretary in a insurance company office and at 
              first I thought she was just another nine to fiver. Except that 
              she dressed very casually and seemed kind of street tough. Like 
              she'd maybe be more at home in a pool hall than in a typing pool. 
              So I was doubly surprised to discover she had her own internet company 
              up on one of the top floors. I only found out because we happened 
              to be sitting at the same table in the building cafeteria one lunch 
              break and got chatting. Later on I realized it had been Gale who'd 
              come and sat with me, not the other way around, but that wasn't 
              something I picked up on then. 
            <p> Right there and then she was a total stranger, apart from our 
              saying "hi" and "hello" to each other in the elevator a few times. 
              But we chatted, the way you do over a coffee, and then it came out 
              about how she had her own company and suite of offices way up there 
              on the top floors. Truth to tell, I was a tad skeptical and I guess 
              it must have shown because Gale invited me to come up and take a 
              look around after quitting time at my place. 
            <p> So when it hit five I hit the <i>'up'</i> button on the elevator 
              instead of going down: one minute later and my skepticism was down 
              and out as well. Whether or not Gale actually owned the company 
              there was no doubt at all that the dozen computer geeks in the offices 
              treated her as the boss lady. As for the fixtures and fittings, 
              everything was top quality, from the resolution of the computer 
              screens right down to wastepaper bins with the company logo imprinted 
              on them. The logo was a drawing of a young dude with wings on his 
              heels and his helmet. 
            <p> "Hermes, the messenger of the Greek gods," Gale had explained. 
              "You see the stick he's carrying with the snakes twisted around 
              it? That's the Greek symbol for medicine, and the roll of parchment 
              in his other hand is meant to show we're in the publishing business." 
            <p> She'd grinned at my dumb look: "The medical industry around this 
              state uses a zillion forms every day and every doctor's office and 
              hospital comes to a stop if it runs out of any of them. We have 
              warehouses all over the state filled with every kind of health industry 
              form. Any time any medical administrator suddenly realizes he or 
              she is running out of the right kind of paperwork they can log onto 
              our web site and tell us what forms they want: then we courier them 
              to where they're wanted straight away. It's a very customer orientated 
              business, but a very well paying one. My guys and gals are the ones 
              with the Porsches parked down in the basement, you'll notice." 
            <p> "Gee" was all I could say. 
            <p> No fancy cars were heading my way, not in my crummy job. It was 
              a good day for me if I managed to get a seat on the subway. And 
              here was Gale, leaning back in her boss's seat, a hand tooled black 
              leather swivel seat, in her own office, obviously in complete control 
              of her company and everybody working in it. Even if she still seemed 
              a kind of a round peg in a square hole it all seemed to be working 
              out real fine for her. And if you're perhaps thinking I was as envious 
              of her and sore at myself, well, I won't argue. Then she said something 
              which had me listening very hard to every word. 
            <p> "Truth to tell, Philippa, we might have a few more openings coming 
              along here within a week or so. The people we take on would have 
              a great chance of getting in on e-commerce on the ground floor." 
              She'd laughed and glanced out of her window across the city skyline. 
              "OK, maybe I should say on the top floor. I want to grow the business 
              into other states, so I need some salespeople to do the legwork 
              out there in the great big medical world. And since so many of our 
              customers are guys I'm all for having some attractive legs to do 
              that legwork. Long hours, lots of travel, plenty of work, but great 
              paychecks and maybe a chance to meet a handsome doctor or two on 
              the way through. Think you might be interested?" 
            <p> Only enough to kill for it. That was what I told Gale. 
            <p> "How about your partner. How would he feel about you being away 
              from home so much?" 
            <P> I told her the truth, that there was nobody that special in my 
              life 
            <P> She seemed more interested then and gave me a card with her address 
              on it. "I'm all booked out until the weekend but if you'd like to 
              drop by on Saturday afternoon about four we can talk some more. 
              Have a few drinks and see how things stack up. That OK with you, 
              Philippa?" 
            <p> "It's fine," I confirmed, very sincerely, "Just fine." 
            <p> I arrived on time and if Gale's office had impressed me her apartment 
              took my breath away. It seemed as if she lived on her own, the same 
              as I did, but unlike me her income was ample enough for a lifestyle 
              that fell somewhere between luxury and opulence. Yet all the time 
              we were talking I still had this impression that this wasn't a lifestyle 
              she'd been brought up in. Especially when I noticed a tattoo on 
              one of her arms. So, naturally, I tried to satisfy my curiosity 
              about her background with some questions. Not that it did me any 
              good because Gale neatly sidestepped them. Until I was about to 
              leave, and it seemed I'd got the job offer in my pocket. Which was 
              right where I wanted it with the kind of money that Gale was offering. 
              And then, when everything looked OK, Gale finally gave out a little 
              bit about herself. 
            <p> "Philippa, I guess you're wondering how a girl like me from the 
              wrong side of the tracks got the money to set up my own company?" 
            <P> "Well, it crossed my mind," I admitted. 
            <p> "OK, I'll tell you as much as I can, and that is that I ran pretty 
              wild when I was younger. I did a lot of wheeling and dealing on 
              the street, and I wasn't a hooker. I guess you can work out what 
              I'm talking about. Anyway, I got to the stage where I was handling 
              some big deals and did well out of them. And then I walked away 
              from the business, from the whole scene, and went into a legitimate 
              investment. All that is OK, but it's left me with a problem. The 
              guys I worked with before don't like people leaving them. It's not 
              a thing that happens often and I had to do some pretty hard bargaining 
              to get off the hook and out of the crew. You understand what I'm 
              saying?" 
            <p> I nodded again: it seemed clear enough that Gale was telling me 
              she'd been in the drug business, made her pile and gotten out, but 
              still knew enough to make a lot of her drug pushing contacts wary 
              of her maybe blowing the whistle on them sometime. 
            <p> "OK, so to be totally straight with you, Philippa, a big slice 
              of the company is owned by the main guy I used to deal for. That 
              way he gets his profits and he gets to feel I'm still on his team. 
              Maybe I don't carry the ball anymore but he knows where I am and 
              what I'm doing. And he also knows he has enough insurance on me 
              to feel comfortable about things. Do you understand that?" 
            <p> "No, I guess not," I admitted. 
            <p> It was about then I decided I'd maybe had too many bourbons for 
              one afternoon. I was also having to listen to the devil and the 
              angel on my shoulders. The angel was telling me I didn't want to 
              have anything to do with anybody who'd been in the drug business. 
              Then I thought about what it would be like to have a job I'd actually 
              enjoy doing and the little devil started kicking a little angel 
              ass. 
            <p> Gale spread her hands out wide apart, her head tilted over and 
              a half smile on her lips, like an Arab shopkeeper getting ready 
              for some enjoyable haggling over a price. "Insurance in this case 
              is having something on file about the other guy that he -- or she 
              -- wouldn't want passed around. Something which would lose them 
              a lot of respect. If I tried to pull anything on my main man he'd 
              be able to pull my file and do me some real damage. Not only that, 
              but he insists that I provide some kind of insurance to him for 
              everybody who comes to work for me. Philippa, I really do want you 
              to work for me, I do want to make you rich, but I need something 
              I can show to the man as proof that you won't be trying to gas us. 
              Which in your case is a real problem." 
            <p> "Excuse me?" 
            <p> Gale's smile turned into a rueful wince: "I've run a background 
              check on you as a prospective employee, Philippa, and I've never 
              spent so much money for so small a result. The inquiry agent I hired 
              came back and suggested that maybe we should send your report to 
              the Vatican and see if you could be put in line to be made a saint. 
              Because if you've ever done anything wrong in your life nobody seems 
              to have noticed it." 
            <p> I was totally surprised. Surprised that Gale would have run a 
              check on me, and done it so quickly. But what was really surprising 
              was that my cheeks were burning with embarrassment at being discovered 
              as an innocent abroad. Perhaps that was the very mark of my innocence, 
              especially when I had to bite back the words "I'm sorry", which 
              I was about to say. 
            <p> Well, and I was truly sorry: it seemed like the best chance I'd 
              ever had in my entire life was about to go begging, and all because 
              I'd never had the initiative to commit a crime or do the wrong thing 
              sometime. Just my luck! 
            <p> "Don't look so miserable," Gale laughed. "Doing something wrong 
              is the easiest thing in the world, it's doing the good things which 
              are hard. We can get this little problem fixed this afternoon without 
              even leaving the apartment." 
            <p> "What do you mean? What do you want me to do?" I asked her. 
            <p> "Just trust me, Philippa, that's all. I'm going to give you a 
              makeover that will make you look a very sexy girl. And you can start 
              by getting changed into something less formal." 
            <P> It was the strangest experience. She went off into another room 
              and came back carrying a small laundry basket with all kinds of 
              odds and ends in it. "OK, Philippa, I want you to put these on and 
              see what you look like. I'll be back in five minutes and when I 
              get back I want to see you looking like Cinderella after the Fairy 
              Godmother has waved her wand around." 
            <p> "But what's it all about?" I asked her. 
            <p> Gale had laughed: "It's all about playing Mistress and Slave, 
              sweetie. And if you really want the job I'm offering I guess you 
              know which role is reserved for you. Now you're down to four and 
              a half minutes and after that you'll either be changed or out the 
              door. And no briefs, sweetie, no briefs, that's your first order. 
              I want to see you bare assed." 
            <p> Well, that was laying it on the line and I almost made a bolt 
              for the door there and then without waiting to pushed towards it. 
              But I didn't. Maybe I should make it simple and say that I stayed 
              on because I wanted that job. Sure, that was part of it but there 
              was more. Maybe meeting with somebody like Gale for the first time, 
              somebody who was a success and a boss instead of just another worker. 
              I admired her and wanted the chance she might offer me to get on 
              the same path. So I stripped off and started putting on the things 
              in the basket. It seemed like it was high time to cross a few tracks 
              myself. 
            <P> I felt like I was a kid again and playing at dress up with my 
              older sister's clothes. A pink suspender belt and white stockings, 
              and a pair of white high heels. And that was more than enough to 
              make me feel quite immoral, having to wear those things with no 
              underwear. Although I kept my bra on as Gale hadn't told me to take 
              it off. There were also some other things left lying in the basket, 
              like stage props. A long string of pearls, and two white leather 
              belts as well. I knew what to do with them but not with the coil 
              of rope that was left in the basket after I'd put everything else 
              on. All I could do with that was to run my fingers over it and go 
              weak at the knees. Because I already knew then what Gale was planning 
              to do with me. 
            <p> If I hadn't known before then I certainly would have done when 
              she came clumping back into the room wearing nothing but a dark 
              negligee, dark stockings and knee high black boots. The only props 
              missing were a whip and a Nazi hat and I almost started giggling, 
              but I guessed that would be the wrong thing to do. Instead I just 
              sat on the edge of my chair trying to look demure and with my legs 
              held very close together. 
            <p> Gale reached down and caught my elbow in a firm grip: "Come on, 
              honey, I'll show you the playpen." 
            <p> The playpen turned out to be an alcove with a small bed in it 
              and all kinds of odds and ends hanging from the ceiling on thin 
              chains. It wasn't an attempt at interior furnishing which impressed 
              me very much, though I have to admit that most of my attention was 
              on the video camera standing on a tripod in one corner of the small 
              room. 
            <p> Gale was still holding firmly onto my elbow and steered me towards 
              the end of the bed. "Sit down there." Two things I noticed straight 
              away: one was that I was staring straight into the camera's lens; 
              the other was that Gale had brought the coil of rope with her. Then 
              I noticed something else, that the recording light on the camera 
              was glowing. 
            <P> <img align="left"  hspace="10" width="404" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/bt1v.jpg"> 
            <p> Gale sat down beside me on the bed. "Have you ever performed in 
              front of a camera before, Philippa?" she asked me. 
            <p> My throat was dry, I felt nervous and I shook my head without 
              saying anything. 
            <p> "There's no need to freak out," Gale said quietly. "What I want 
              you to do is to pretend that I'm a potential customer for the company 
              and no matter what happens, you're going to make me happy. You understand 
              that, Philippa?" 
            <p> "Yes," I answered her. "Yes, I understand that." 
            <P> <img align="right"  hspace="10" width="401" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/jy22.jpg"> 
            <p> That was what I said, and I thought I meant it, yet when Gale 
              dropped her hand on my shoulder I nearly jumped out of my skin. 
            <p> "My, aren't you the touchy one," Gale commented. "You're as nervous 
              as a virgin in a whorehouse." Then she giggled. "Don't worry, honey, 
              I'm not going to pop your cherry." 
            <p> One of her fingers sneaked underneath my bra strap, lifted it 
              a fraction, then eased it over my shoulder. "There's no need to 
              keep this thing on, Philippa, we're all Girlsimages together, aren't 
              we?" 
            <P> <img align="left"  hspace="10" width="374" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/g42x.jpg"> 
            <p> Her fingers slid the strap down further, as far as my elbow, and 
              the cup fell clear, revealing my left boob. Gale stared at it and 
              almost seemed to be licking her lips. It felt like she was the wolf 
              and I was a potential Red Riding Hoodburger. Even so, I still couldn't 
              believe she was interested in me -- not in that way. 
            <p> "Gale ... ?" My throat seemed even drier now. But she was expecting 
              the question I didn't want to ask. 
            <p> "Don't worry, sweetie, we're just having some fun making a tape, 
              that's all. But we need to get this thing off first." 
            <P> <img align="right"  hspace="10" width="254" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/he2z.jpg"> 
            <p> She took my bra off and then moved closer to me. "Smile at the 
              camera, Philippa. Show how happy we are together." 
            <p> It seemed like an odd thing to say but I smiled as she wanted 
              me to. It was the strangest feeling to be looking into the camera's 
              eye with hardly anything on, very embarrassing, and even more embarrassing 
              when Gale threw one of her heavy boots over my left thigh and held 
              my legs wide open. What had started out as informal job interview 
              was turning out to something like a audition for a centerfold shot. 
              This was all totally wacky but maybe it was the sort of thing that 
              rich and successful people did. 
            <p> "You're going to show this to other people?" I asked. "To some 
              guys?" It seemed impossible to believe. 
            <p> "That's right. You want me to come back and tell you everything 
              they say about you while they were watching it? Like what a horny 
              chick you are?" 
            <P> "Are you sure they won't be laughing at me?" I asked. 
            <p> "Don't play yourself, Philippa, you're a real good looker. Come 
              on, let's give them something to sweat on," Gale encouraged me. 
              "They'll go apeshit when they see me doing this to you, honey." 
            <P> <img align="left"  hspace="10" width="293" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/veg2.jpg"> 
            <p> I guess I'd been about three-quarters expecting it but even so 
              it was a shock when she began fondling one of my breasts. I'd always 
              been nervous about letting a guy do that, let alone a girl, and 
              I was frightened of her advances. Frightened, and ashamed, and when 
              I made an effort to get loose Gale dug her sharp fingernails in 
              around my nipple. 
            <p> "Relax, relax, this is your lucky day, honeypot," she whispered, 
              just like a man might have said to me in the same situation. 
            <p> What could I do? Get into a struggle with those nails still hooked 
              into me? Tell her to get her hand off me because I'd changed my 
              mind and didn't want a great new job after all? Neither of those 
              alternatives seemed like a good choice. So I kind of accepted things 
              going on the way they were while not giving out any body language 
              which would suggest I was enjoying Gale's touch. But it turned out 
              to be hard to go with the flow when the current started getting 
              a lot stronger. Because Gale took hold of my other tit and held 
              it firmly while she ran her tongue over and around my nipple. 
            <P> <img align="right"  hspace="10" width="454" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/eve4.jpg"> 
            <p> What was so strange that except for her long nails it felt just 
              like having a man starting in on some serious foreplay. In fact 
              the only way I could deal with it was to close my eyes and try to 
              pretend that it was a guy coming on at me. But it wasn't an easy 
              self deception to make with the sweet scent of Gale's expensive 
              perfume in my nostrils. Trying as much as I could not to protest, 
              I still heard my voice whimpering like a kicked puppy's. 
            <p> "Oh dear," Gale whispered smoothly, "It seems like we'll have 
              to undertake a little personality adjustment here." She picked up 
              the coil of rope and ran it through the fingers of both hands like 
              the head of a lynch mob picking out a strong looking tree branch. 
            <p> "OK, Pauline, lie down on the bed on your stomach and put your 
              hands behind your back. We're now going to make this tape a hell 
              of a lot more interesting for the lucky guys who get to see you 
              getting your new job." 
            <P> <img align="left"  hspace="10" width="433" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/mc7d.jpg"> 
            <p> The bitch could see right through me, she knew how desperate I 
              was to achieve some thing, to be somebody. So I didn't utter one 
              word of useless protest and I didn't try to leave. What I did do 
              was to lie down on the bed and let Gale truss my wrists up behind 
              my back. It was no play acting either: she knew her knots like a 
              sailor and by the time she'd finished I was as helpless as if I'd 
              been handcuffed. 
            <p> Afterwards I could hear her boots hitting the carpet as she walked 
              around the bed. Walking as in like a wrestler walking around a ring 
              after he's just thrown his opponent over the ropes: more of a kind 
              of triumphal strut. Then she dropped her weight heavily on the bed 
              beside me. 
            <P> <img align="right"  hspace="10" width="453" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/b3eg.jpg"> 
            <p> "Looks as if Thanksgiving is here early this year, Philippa. Let's 
              see how the turkey feels." 
            <p> Her fingers touched my back, ran down over my cheeks and then 
              squeezed one of them as if I really was some piece of flesh to be 
              mauled around before being bought. And, once again, I wished that 
              Gale would cut her nails shorter and blunter. She made me yelp as 
              they dug in deeply. 
            <p> "Aw shit, I'm sorry, honeybunch," she said, half laughing. "I 
              didn't mean to hurt you. Let me make it up with a little tender 
              loving care down here." 
            <p> I couldn't help but give a gasp of protest as those nails moved 
              lower yet, dancing and fluttering between the insides of my thighs 
              like trapped butterflies. 
            <P> <img align="left"  hspace="10" width="478" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/bt2c.jpg"> 
            <p> All that did though was to make Gail seem more interested in me. 
              Her fingers began to stroke me like a lover's, at the highest and 
              smoothest part of my leg. I didn't dare to close my thighs, as much 
              as I disliked what she was doing. But when her thumb tickled my 
              clit I couldn't stop myself from whining: "No, no!" 
            <p> Gale snorted in what sounded like contempt: "Oh dear, my little 
              Barbie doll doesn't want Mama to play with her, hey? Well, I've 
              got just the thing to beat the arguments out of you with, honeybunch. 
              I think it's time your ass met Mr Hairbrush." 
            <p> She was going to spank me? Nobody had ever done anything like 
              that me, never. It couldn't be true. 
            <p> It was true, as real and substantial as the wooden hairbrush that 
              Gale took out from underneath the bed, held up in front of my face, 
              and then slapped down lightly on my bottom. 
            <P> <img align="right"  hspace="10" width="419" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/fly7.jpg"> 
            <p> "OK, Philippa, I've got all evening, a strong arm and I guarantee 
              your ass will wear out before this brush does. So you just let me 
              know when you're ready." 
            <p> "Ready for what?" 
            <p> "Ready to fuck with me, darling. I'm going to make a real woman 
              out of you." 
            <p> "I'm not into that scene . . . ooowww!" 
            <p> I'd had no idea that a brush could hurt so much from one slap. 
              It did though and one thing was plain from the start, that Gale's 
              boasts about the strength of her arms were well justified. 
            <p> "Oh, I just love it when Girlsimages like you play hard to get, 
              Philippa. Now grit your teeth because here come de judge!" 
            <P> <img align="left"  hspace="10" width="435" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/py3x.jpg"> 
            <p> It wasn't a wild, hurried kind of a punishment. That was what 
              I was expecting but Gale worked differently. Hard strokes, painful 
              strokes, but delivered with a pause between each one, and every 
              impact on a slightly different place at a slightly different angle. 
              She didn't say anything either, just grunting a little with her 
              own efforts, as though doing some kind of hard working chore, like 
              a third world woman slapping laundry on river rocks to get it clean. 
            <p> At first all I could think about was the pain, because each impact 
              did hurt, and I cried out at each one. Then, as Gale kept on paddling 
              my butt, there seemed to be some kind of a numbing effect which 
              made each individual blow not so bad but had all my ass glowing 
              as if I was standing in front of a roaring fire with my panties 
              down. 
            <p> "Oooh, Pauline, the guys are so going to enjoy watching this," 
              Gale cooed softly in my ear as she kept on administering the punishment. 
            <p> You know how sometimes you can realize something which can turn 
              your ideas upside down and inside out? It was like that for me right 
              then, because I suddenly had a picture in my mind, like I was watching 
              it on a TV screen. And what I was seeing on the screen was a bunch 
              of men in a darkened room, and they were all watching a TV screen. 
              Only what was on their screen was me, getting spanked, my hands 
              bound, my ass cheeks glowing red and shivering as I wriggled around 
              on top of Gale's bed. The odd thing in what I was seeing on my mind's 
              screen was that although the guys' faces were in the shadows, yet 
              I could see each one of them had his hand on his exposed cock, working 
              it urgently in his excitement as he witnessed my humiliation. 
            <p> It should have been a disgusting thought. Maybe it would have 
              been before, in Gale's phrase "I'd met Mr Hairbrush." But right 
              then and there the thought of being able to turn on a bunch of men 
              watching my spanking had me suddenly becoming as wet as a damp sponge, 
              and if I had been in a room with a bunch of hard cocks I'd have 
              jumped on top of the nearest one without even bothering to say "Have 
              a nice day" to whoever owned it. 
            <p> Maybe there was a change in the noises I was making which tipped 
              Gale off about what was happening. In any case she put down the 
              brush and slipped her fingers back between my legs and upwards, 
              checking for what she found, then giggling. 
            <P> <img align="right"  hspace="10" width="433" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/bagq.jpg"> 
            <p> "Philly, you are a filly after all," was her comment. "Now let's 
              see if your tits are getting as turned on as the rest of you." 
            <p> She half rolled me onto my side, reached down and began fondling 
              one of my tits again. But this time I didn't try to stop her, and 
              this time she could feel the taut fleshline around my nipple. 
            <p> "I've got you now, haven't I, Miss 'never been fucked except on 
              a Sunday after church'. I've got you just where I want you." 
            <p> <img align="left"  hspace="10" width="468" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/try4.jpg"> 
            <p> Gale stood up, pulled off her negligee, dropped it on the floor 
              and knelt down on the bed once more. Then she took hold of me again, 
              not to fondle but to jerk on my boob as if she wanted to pull it 
              free from the rest of me. The pain was enough to make me scream 
              out her name. 
            <p> "Oh no, not Gale anymore," she rebuked me. "From now on, you call 
              me Mistress. And if you've got any problems with that I think you'll 
              find I can get you to do whatever I want you to. You've met Mr Hairbrush, 
              so now you can meet Mr Pants Hanger." 
            <p> Pants hanger? What was she talking about? I soon found out because 
              that was what she took out from underneath the bed. A two dollar 
              pants hanger with a spring clip on each end. 
            <P> <img align="right"  hspace="10" width="432" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/de62.jpg"> 
            <p> Gale smiled and held the clips close to my bust, adjusting the 
              width of the hangar so that the clips were exactly aligned with 
              the tips of my breasts. Then she took a clip in each hand, opened 
              them and then snapped them down onto my nipples. It hurt, of course, 
              though that was what I'd come to expect from everything that Gale 
              did. 
            <p> "You look a lot better now, Philly," she gloated as she stared 
              down at me. Her eyes were brighter than I remembered seeing them 
              before and she looked as if she spreading out a winning hand on 
              a poker table covered in bills. 
            <P> <img align="middle"  hspace="10" width="529" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/gryt.jpg"> 
            <p> Then she laughed and lifted up the hanger until my jugs were hanging 
              from it, the tiny teeth on the clips tearing at the trapped aureoles 
              like lobster's claws. If Gale wanted me to make me beg for mercy 
              ... well, if that was what she wanted, she got it. Because I would 
              have said anything to make her ease her grip on those fucking clips. 
            <p> <img align="right"  hspace="10" width="424" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/ket3.jpg"> 
            <p> My tormentor finally relented, letting the hanger down a fraction 
              of an inch and putting one of her heavy boots up on the side of 
              the bed. 
            <p> "OK. Philippa, how's the company induction going so far? Having 
              fun? Ready to meet some more friends of mine?" 
            <p> "Gale, I'll do whatever you want me to, anything at all," I gasped 
              out. 
            <p> "Yeah, is that right? OK, then I'll make this an introduction 
              first and then see what happens afterwards." 
            <p> From somewhere she got two canes. "Philly, say hi to Mr and Ms 
              Chopstick. You might think they're canes but I've got a better use 
              for them that whipping your dumb ass. If I get anymore arguments 
              out of you, slave girl, I'm going to push one of them up your cunt 
              and the other up your asshole, as far as they'll go. And if you 
              think you're hurting now, gal, you don't know the half of what that'll 
              feel like." 
            <p> "No, no, Mistress, I'll do whatever you want me to," I promised 
              -- loudly. 
            <p> "Let's find out, Slave." 
            <P> <img align="left"  hspace="10" width="450" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/foxx.jpg"> 
            <p> She sat down on the bed and stared down at my face. And then I 
              felt her hand between my opened thighs again. No teasing this time 
              though, no foreplay, but a blatant fingering and stroking and penetrating. 
              I was being felt up as if I was a man's lover but it was a female's 
              hand which was doing it. Again, all I could do was to close my eyes 
              and pretend it was a man doing this to me, the most desirable man 
              I could imagine. 
            <p> Gale's voice was a growl from the back of her throat, like a big 
              cat growling and lashing its tail in warning of an attack: "I'm 
              still not getting your full attention, am I, Philly?" 
            <p> The canes rattled against the hangar as Gale slid them between 
              the wires and my skin. And then she lifted up the canes and the 
              hangar as well, making me beg for mercy again. 
            <p> "Fuck me, Mistress, do anything you want with me, please!" 
            <p> "Thank you, Slave, I think I'll do just that little thing. Now 
              let's hear you enjoying the effort I'm putting into pleasuring your 
              hot little snatch." 
            <P> <img align="right"  hspace="10" width="435" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/cut4.jpg"> 
            <p> There was no alternative. Not only did I press myself as hard 
              as I could against her fingers, I gasped and yelled and whooped 
              like a Indian at the top of my voice as Gale played with me. There 
              was no way that any man could have matched her skill in bringing 
              me closer and closer to an total orgasm: it was as if she was lighting 
              a fuse in my body which could only end in a shattering explosion. 
              And when it finally happened I screamed out my delight without Gale 
              doing anything more than staring down at me as if I was some kind 
              of an animal she was experimenting on. 
            <P> <img align="middle"  hspace="10" width="493" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/b6e8.jpg"> 
            <p> Afterwards, as limp as a empty suit, I watched as she took off 
              the hanger and leaned over me. Gale gently played with one of my 
              sore breasts, watching my reaction as if it were some kind of way 
              of talking to me with touching instead of words. But then she did 
              speak. 
            <p> "How are you feeling now, Slave?" 
            <p> "OK, Mistress," I answered quickly, aware of the clips and the 
              canes till within her reach. "I feel fine." 
            <P> <img align="right"  hspace="10" width="274" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/raf3.jpg"> 
            <p> "That's good, that's great. So let's give you a little massaging 
              here." 
            <p> As gently and softly as before, she began to squeeze both of my 
              tits, and massaging was exactly the word I would have used myself 
              to describe what she was doing, a smooth, comfortable, comforting 
              massage. This time I closed my eyes and whimpered not in denial 
              but with real pleasure from feeling Gale's hands on my body. 
            <p> "I've wanted you ever since I first saw you, Slave. Now you're 
              mine and just to prove it I'm going to untie your hands. But you'd 
              better be a good girl for me, or I'll make you a very sad and sorry 
              slave girl. Are you hearing all this, honey?" 
            <p> "Yes, Mistress. I'm hearing everything you're saying," I answered 
              obediently. 
            <p> "Now there's a good little bitch." 
            <p> Again, she rolled me over onto my front, but only to untie me. 
              Then I felt her unhook my back suspenders from the stocking tops. 
              "On your back again, Slave." 
            <p> <img align="right"  hspace="10" width="473" height="340" border="2" src="Girls/Girlsimages/subm.jpg"> 
            <p> I guess it's a truly weird thing to say but obeying Gale's hard 
              edged voice seemed to be becoming almost a natural thing to do. 
              After she'd taken off the rope and finished stripping me I shivered 
              and wondered what the next set of orders were going to be. Whatever 
              they were, I knew I was so completely under Gale's control that 
              I would have to follow them. 
            <p> Why didn't I mind about that? Maybe because when somebody else 
              is giving the orders all the responsibility is lifted off your back. 
              Maybe that was my trouble in life, I always wanted somebody else 
              to carry the load, even down to something as basic as sex. Well, 
              if a bedroom boss was what I'd unknowingly been craving for, I'd 
              certainly found one in Gale.

            <p> As soon as I was naked at her feet -- or, to be precise, at the 
              tips of her boots -- Gale grabbed a tuft of hair and pulled on it 
              hard enough to make my eyes water. 
            <p> "You've had the easy part so far, my precious little slave girl. 
              I've given you some fun, so now it's your turn to give me some. 
              If you've got any problems with that this is not a good time to 
              mention them, OK?" 
            <p> "Yes, Mistress," I gasped. "I mean, no, Mistress." 
            <p> "That's good to hear, my little maid servant. But there's something 
              you can do with your tongue that'll be even more fun than listening 
              to it. You're going down for a nice long count, Slave, and I'll 
              tell you when you can come up for air again."
