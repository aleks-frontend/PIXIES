              <P> It was a great day, beautiful and sunny, and Adele's cousin had gone 
          to work. Adele hadn't, because she was in town on holiday and staying 
          at Sapho's villa. Being from the cold South, from Tasmania, she decided 
          to spend the morning on the beach. But the Queensland sun soon proved 
          stronger than her suntan oil and Adele wisely decided to quit before 
          she got deep fried. The North was a dangerous place for a fair skinned 
          red head protected only by a bikini. 
        <P> Another annoying thing about the area was the way the locals seemed 
          quite content to have bathrooms with showers in them but no baths. Back 
          home one of Adele's favorite refuges from the cold was a steaming hot 
          bath. Hot, sticky, sore and sandy, she felt that a prolonged soak in 
          cool water would be just as relaxing on a day when the mercury was going 
          up and up. But Sapho didn't have a bath in her otherwise perfect little 
          villa, only one of the ubiquitous showers. If Adele wanted a bath she 
          was going to have to improvise one. 
        <P> It was as she was setting up a laundry tub on a table in the villa's 
          back porch that she noticed a battered old suitcase standing in one 
          corner. She hadn't seen it there before, but guessed that it must belong 
          to Greg, Sapho's boyfriend. Her live in boyfriend, or at least he was 
          once a month, when he flew in for some R and R from the mine site he 
          worked on out in the bush. But he wasn't due for rotation for another 
          week, so perhaps the case was a spare one that Sapho had brought out 
          for some reason. Adele was far more interested in finding a bottle of 
          wine to go with her mood and the heat. The villa's wine bar had an Hamelin 
          Bay Cabernet Sauvignon which seemed like it might hit the spot nicely. 
        <p> <img align="right" WIDTH = "410" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/a75q.jpg"> 
        <p> It did. A glass or two and a gentle rub down with a sponge had Adele 
          feeling like a new girl. Which wasn't as much fun as feeling a new boy. 
          There had been some real spunks down on the beach, but none of them 
          had come near her, and what was a holiday without a touch of romance 
          in it? 
        <P> Still, even in the beach had turned out not to be her place, the city 
          had plenty of good pubs and clubs just waiting to be checked out. One 
          of them was sure to have just the sort of guy she wanted to spend some 
          quality time with. A guy with a lot of good qualities -- and a big bath. 
          A bath big enough for two people to splash around in at one time. A 
          bath you could make as many waves as you liked in. 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "363" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/tnvc.jpg"> 
        <p> Adele giggled to herself and leaned back to feel the muted sunlight 
          coming through the shaded windows on her face, warm and stimulating, 
          but not as warm and stimulating as the scenes she was playing out in 
          her imagination. She was arranging them in her mind in the most interesting 
          combinations she could think of when the side door of the porch opened 
          and a male voice said: "Hi, you must be Adele. Warm day, hey?" 
        <P> Astonished, she looked over her shoulder, putting her hands up to 
          cover herself as she stared the young guy who'd come in carrying a long 
          handled shovel. 
        <P> "Who the hell are you and what are you doing here?" 
        <P> "Well, the reason I'm standing here with this shovel in my hand is 
          because a guy down the pub sold me a treasure map and I think the loot 
          is buried in the back garden here. Don't worry about it, I'm a fully 
          licensed pirate, it's just that I don't get to go to sea very much because 
          I always get sea sick. Oh yeah, and my parrot is away at the cleaners 
          right now, being re-feathered. It was getting pretty bare around the 
          backside, but not as bare as you, Adele. By the way, can you spare a 
          glass of that Sauvignon for a member of the working class?" 
        <P> Adele gaped at him, wondering if he was some kind of a nutter. 
        <P> "Go away, or I'll call the cops." 
        <P> "The phone's in the hall. Go ahead and call. I'll just stand and watch 
          while you do it." 
        <P> "How come you know where the phone is?" 
        <P> "I live here. My name's Greg. I would have thought Sapho might have 
          mentioned me at some time or another. And the reason I'm standing here 
          with this bloody silly implement in my hand is because I was catching 
          up on the gardening when I heard some female giggling away to herself 
          inside my villa. So I came to investigate and I brought the shovel with 
          me in case a gang of chicks had broken in to get their hands on my body 
          and I was going to have to beat them off with it." 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "346" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/dykz.jpg"> 
        <p> Adele burst out laughing when she realized who she was talking to. 
          The whole situation seemed so humorous she couldn't stop herself. 
        <P> "But you're not supposed to be coming back for another week!" 
        <P> "Yeah, normally, that'd be right. But the company flew some of us 
          back a week earlier this time to learn the mechanics of some new Haulpak 
          dump trucks we're getting on site. I got back this morning and I'd forgotten 
          that Sapho had said she was inviting her cousin up from Tassie while 
          I was away." 
        <P> Cleo giggled again: "OK, but if you were a gentleman, you'd at least 
          close your eyes while you're talking to me." 
        <P> "From where I'm standing I'd rather look with my eyes open and talk 
          with my mouth closed. The more I see of you, Adele the more I'm starting 
          to mumble and stutter anyway. Look at the way my shovel's shaking." 
        <P> "You'd better go back outside and do some more work with it, then, 
          while I get dressed." 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "263" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/ffp3.jpg"> 
        <p> Greg grinned at her, opened the door he'd come in by, threw the shovel 
          out through it and let it fall on the concrete path outside with a ringing 
          clatter. Then he smiled at Adele, closed the door again and stepped 
          up to the bath. 
        <P> "But first, ma cherie, I must tell you how enchanted I am to welcome 
          you to my humble home." 
        <P> His hand reached down, caught hers, lifted it to his lips and kissed 
          it with stylish aplomb. Adele couldn't stop herself from giggling again 
          at being in this weird situation. She felt she ought to be embarrassed 
          for herself and angry at Greg, but somehow she was too busy laughing 
          at him to get seriously mad. 
        <P> "Look, are you going to leave me alone so I can get dressed." 
        <P> "Why, what are you going to cover up that I haven't already seen, 
          my beautiful?" 
        <P> "You shouldn't be seeing anything, that's the point." 
        <P> "There's an old saying about not crying over spilt horses after the 
          stable door has bolted. So why spoil a perfectly good bath just to spoil 
          my viewing pleasure?" 
        <P> "Go away for a minute." 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "387" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/yyc2.jpg"> 
        <p> He sat down next to her, put his arm around Adele's shoulders, smiled 
          and said: "Let's deal with this like grownups. You've shown me yours 
          so about I show you mine?" 
        <P> Adele felt his fingers gently stroking her skin and shivered: "Well, 
          maybe -- I could use a laugh." 
        <P> "You've already had one. What was so funny that I could hear you giggling 
          away to yourself when I was outside?" 
        <P> "I'm not going to tell you." 
        <P> "Ah, ah, so it was something you're ashamed of. You were having a 
          little daydream about something naughty, and probably helping your imagination 
          along with your fingers. What a good thing I'm here to help you enjoy 
          yourself even more." 
        <P> Adele's cheeks felt even redder than the patches of sunburn: "I wasn't 
          thinking of anything like that at all." 
        <P> "You must have been remembering the last episode of the Simpsons you 
          saw, then. That's why you're blushing like a virgin." 
        <P> "I'm not blushing." 
        <P> "And you're not a virgin, either, I guess. Good." 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "254" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/vmh6.jpg"> 
        <p> Greg picked the sponge up out of the water and rubbed it lightly against 
          Adele's left breast: "I often do this for Sapho in the shower. But a 
          bath is better -- you can kind of slosh things around." 
        <P> "Well you're not sloshing any of my things around. You're supposed 
          to be Sapho's boyfriend, not mine." 
        <P> "You don't have to worry about that, I'm everybody's friend. Now, 
          how about a nice back rub, on the house and obligation free." 
        <P> "No!" 
        <P> "I knew you'd love the idea." 
        <P> He moved around behind her. Adele felt his strong hands settle on 
          her shoulders and begin a vigorous massage of her muscles around the 
          base of her neck. She tried, briefly, to shake off the fingers which 
          were squeezing her, but there was no way of doing it. Not without hurting 
          him with her fingernails, anyway, and what would happen afterwards? 
          All kinds of trouble. And then there was another good reason for not 
          putting up much of a fight -- she was thoroughly enjoying the massaging 
          that Greg was giving her. Enjoying it and becoming excited by it, ever 
          more so the lower his hands worked down her spine. 
        <P> "Greg, you shouldn't be doing that." 
        <P> "It's OK, Adele, I don't mind listening to you panting away and showing 
          how turned on you're getting. Don't worry about it; I can always spread 
          the fertilizer on the garden some other time." 
        <P> "God, but you're a cheeky bastard." Adele protested, yet without any 
          real anger. 
        <P> Greg talked like a impudent schoolboy but he used his hands like a 
          grown man. A man skilled in giving real pleasure in the way he touched 
          her body. Right now his thumbs were pressing down on her spine, walking 
          their way lower and lower like close fitting foot prints until they 
          were down in the water. Then one of his hands slid around her hip, sending 
          out ripples like a half submerged alligator closing in on its prey. 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "428" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/5r82.jpg"> 
        <P> "No, Greg, you mustn't ... " Adele talked the talk but did nothing 
          to fend off the fingers sliding around the front of her leg before diving 
          deeper, down to their objective. 
        <P> "Hey, I've found a little underwater cave -- I wonder what lives in 
          here?" 
        <P> His exploring fingers had taken over from her day dreams, urgent reality 
          seizing her body from her in a few mad minutes. Adele sighed and wriggled 
          at his touch, her full breasts pressed against the side of the small 
          bath as she allowed him to do whatever he wanted. 
        <P> "Hey, I think I've found an eel in there -- only a small one but it's 
          getting bigger. I think it wants to come out and play." 
        <P> "You're taking advantage of me, Greg, you know that?" 
        <P> "Yes, I'm totally ashamed of myself. On the other hand I've hardly 
          seen a sheila for a month and I'm feeling as horny as a rhino. So now 
          I'm going to grab hold of those big tits of yours and give them a stir 
          around." 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "388" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/6d3w.jpg"> 
        <p> It was no surprise at all that Greg did as he said he would, taking 
          her in both his hands and gently massaging her boobs. It was also no 
          surprise to Adele to find herself responding by turning her head and 
          kissing Greg passionately. 
        <P> Of course what they were doing was completely wrong and Greg was every 
          kind of a cheat on Sapho to be doing this but trying to stop things 
          now they'd gone this far was as impossible as putting a bush fire back 
          into a match head. Which was why her tongue was pressing back against 
          his and her breath was snorting out through her nostrils like gusts 
          of gale driven wind. 
        <P> Eventually it was Greg who broke free first, grinning at her. "I think 
          it's time you came out of that bath and got dried off. The only place 
          I want you slippery is where I'm going to put my prick into you." 
        <P> "You're a cheeky bastard. It's probably not worth having anyway." 
        <P> "Ah, ah. A challenge -- OK then, you can check it out for yourself." 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "214" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/77j2.jpg"> 
        <p> Greg pushed the waistband of his shorts down and let them fall to 
          the floor. He was wearing nothing underneath but a half grown erection 
          of a size and length which made Adele's eyes widen. He saw her reaction 
          and moved forward to the edge of the bath, his hand pressing against 
          the back of Adele's neck. 
        <P> "Come on, take a real close look." 
        <P> Without any hesitation she allowed her face to be pushed up close 
          against his swaying meat, able to see every tiny detail, to smell it 
          like a dog being offered a meal. And like an obedient bitch she put 
          out her tongue and licked the offered organ gently along the top. His 
          hand tightened on the back of her neck at the touch. 
        <P> "What do you reckon, then, girl. Is it worth having or not?" 
        <P> Adele had to swallow hard before she could answer. 
        <P> "Oh yes, it's worth having. It's surely worth having." 
        <P> "Then don't just sit there dripping, come on out here where I can 
          get at you with the towel." 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "205" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/hh7h.jpg"> 
        <P> He helped her out like a footman helping a princess to descend from 
          a coach, then started drying her off with powerful strokes from the 
          towel in his hands. Adele loved it. 
        <P> "It's about time I had a servant to look after me properly." 
        <P> Greg laughed: "Enjoy it while it lasts. Pretty soon you're going to 
          be the one that's down on your knees doing the dirty work." 
        <P> "In your dreams, bro, in your dreams -- oh!" 
        <P> Greg had started stroking between her legs again, but this time he 
          was using his hand instead of the towel. 
        <P> "What was that you said, girlie?" 
        <P> "Er -- I said that maybe you had a chance, after all." 
        <P> "Are you going to give me the best blow job you know how to, or not?" 
        <P> "Put me down as an undecided." 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "252" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/ur31.jpg"> 
        <p> "Let me show you a good way of turning around a swinging voter with 
          swinging tits." 
        <P> Greg stood up behind her, turned Adele round by her elbows until she 
          was facing him. Then one hand went down on her stomach, the calloused 
          fingers sliding through the damp patch of her pubic hair, then lower 
          yet to rub gently between Adele's cunt lips. 
        <P> "You're mine, bitch, and you'll do whatever I fucking well tell you 
          to do." 
        <P> Adele found herself gasping and quivering under his aggressive touch, 
          her own fingers starting to scratch at his shoulder in encouragement. 
        <P> "Alright, Greg, alright, but we won't tell Sapho, will we?" 
        <P> He chuckled at the idea: "Well, I certainly wasn't planning to. But 
          don't knock the bath over, otherwise we'll leave one hell of a damp 
          spot on the carpet to explain away." 
        <P> Adele giggled herself: "You think you're a comedian, don't you?" 
        <P> "So are you." 
        <P> "Me?" 
        <P> "Sure; get down on your knees and I'll show you how to make me smile 
          without even saying a word." 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/bv28.jpg"> 
        <p> Adele knelt down as he wanted her to. Again his cock was in her face, 
          even harder and raring to go than before. She held it steady between 
          two fingers as though it were a cigar and then dabbed her tongue underneath 
          the pocket snake's head. 
        <P> "Never mind the taste test, use it as a full on gob stopper," Greg 
          ordered. 
        <P> "Sapho will be really pissed off if you don't want her tonight because 
          I've sucked and fucked with you all afternoon," Adele warned him. 
        <P> "Listen, the time I've spent waiting for this, I could screw you and 
          Sapho and half a nunnery as well. Now get it in your mouth, gal." 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "421" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/df4a.jpg"> 
        <p> Adele complied, giving the request her best by drawing as much of 
          Greg's huge tool in between her lips as she could. 
        <P> "Of course, it's not like I'm forgetting about Sapho or anything," 
          she heard him say. "All the time you're blowing me I'm going to be thinking 
          about fucking her. That's the way a real gentleman deals with a situation 
          like this." 
        <P> Adele made a muffled grunt of protest although his hand kept her head 
          where it was. 
        <P> "Better be nice to me, Adele, or I'll tit fuck you right on those 
          sore patches. Jees, don't you dumb Taswegians have enough sense to keep 
          out of the sun? Alright, don't bother answering that, just keep sucking." 
        <P> She did, and he grudgingly approved: "Hey, you're not a bad little 
          mother sucker, are you?" 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "462" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/v579.jpg"> 
        <p> He sank down on his own knees with supple athleticism, making her 
          squat down in front of him as if she was going through some kind of 
          tribal religious ceremony. The musky taste of him in her mouth mingled 
          with the aroma of the wine still on her palate and the strong smell 
          of the fertilizer he'd been spreading in the garden. It was a unique 
          combination which she'd never forget. 
        <P> Not that there was anything at all about this day was ever likely 
          to fade from her memory. 
        <P> "Oh, yes, you are a good little bitch," Greg gasped in approval. "I 
          think it's time I gave you a taste of your own medicine. How would you 
          like a touch of hand wanking first and then a special treat afterwards?" 
        <P> Adele grunted in response and bobbed her head to show her willingness. 
        <P> "OK, you can come up for air." 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "258" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/er7c.jpg"> 
        <p> She raised herself up into his arms, one of his hands on a nipple, 
          the other one fingering her, his tongue licking around the taut aureole 
          of flesh on the tip of her other breast. Adele whimpered and clutched 
          at his hair in her lust for the things he was doing to her. 
        <P> "How's it going, gal?" 
        <P> "That fucking fertilizer -- I can smell it all the time. From now 
          on I'm going to get horny every time I go near a garden center." 
        <P> Greg laughed and slid his fingers deeper in between her damp flesh: 
          "I wonder if Sapho has used up the batteries in her vibrator while I've 
          been away. Let's find out, hey? Hang on, honey, be back in a flash." 
        <P> He left her, left the room, then re-appeared, briefly and called to 
          her cheerfully: "Lean back on your elbows, open your legs wide and hope 
          your cousin hasn't vibrated away all the volts." 
        <P> "Hah, with my luck I bet she's wanked off all her watts!" 
        <P> Greg laughed and disappeared. Adele stared up at the bright sunlight 
          still streaming in through the roof and tried to make some kind of sense 
          out of how quickly a day could be changed around because of some unforeseen 
          event. But if Sapho ever found out about this, she was going to be angry. 
          Angry? She was going to be ropeable. 
        <P> A buzzing noise came from the doorway as if a giant bee was entering 
          the room, instead of a naked man with a piece of plastic in his hand. 
          He grinned down at her opened legs. "They should call you Eveready instead 
          of the batteries." 
        <P> "Take it back, it's not my color." 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "452" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="3"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/wuy6.jpg"> 
        <P> "Don't you dare talk to your fairy godfather like that, ungrateful 
          wench. Now let's see what happens when I put this wacker packer onto 
          fast forward." 
        <P> Adele gasped and threw her head back as he rubbed her clitoris with 
          the vibrator. The effect was as if the tiny piece of flesh was a kind 
          of sounding board, amplifying the vibrations from the smooth piece of 
          plastic and sending them through her body right out to every nerve ending. 
          And with Greg's eyes watching her intently as she wriggled around on 
          the carpet in front of him! 
        <P> "Hey, Adele, I think you're in the mood for some serious sex," he 
          told her. "I bet there's nothing you won't do for me if I want it." 
        <P> "You cocky ... bastard!" 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/64wz.jpg"> 
        <p> "Yeah, I've got lots of cock, and it's all for you, baby. Any time 
          I want to I'm going to shove it right up your cunt, right here, and 
          you're going to scream for every bit of it. I'm going to fuck you so 
          hard and so often you'll go back to Tassie to be the biggest whore on 
          the island. Now grab your tits and tell me what I'm going to do to you." 
        <P> She tried to speak, to answer but the words were choked off in her 
          throat as she was impaled on the vibrator and it seemed to go off inside 
          her like a long lasting explosion. All she could do was to call out 
          his name: "Greg! Greg!" 
        <P> He twisted and turned the device inside her as an orgasm shook her 
          from head to toe, making her squeal and squeak like a mouse in a trap. 
          And then he took it out and bent his head over her thighs, his beard 
          rubbing against her smooth skin and his tongue licking at the most sensitive 
          places of all. 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "453" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/fj9w.jpg"> 
        <p> "Oh God, that's lovely," Adele whimpered. "It's fucking lovely." 
        <P> "I'll give you another treat soon," Greg said. "I'll take you to the 
          nudist beach and let all the guys there check you out without a stitch 
          on. That'll be fun." 
        <P> Her voice was giggling like a school girl's: "Oh no, you won't!" 
        <P> "No problem. Sapho and I often go there. You can come with us. And 
          I'll arrange for a couple of real hunky guys I know to be there to meet 
          you -- with a king size tube of suncream. You dumb Tasmanians need all 
          the helping hands you can get when it comes to slipping, slopping and 
          slapping." 
        <P> "No way!" 
        <P> Greg didn't answer, his mouth had gone back where it was before, and 
          the scenes sizzling inside her imagination were flowing down to mix 
          with the sensations coming up from his tongue as her fingernails scratched 
          on the carpet like an angry cat's claws. This was an experience like 
          she'd never had before because she'd never met a guy with Greg's self 
          assurance and confidence before. 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "426" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/6seh.jpg"> 
        <p> Then he was suddenly moving up alongside her, and his mouth was on 
          hers. Without hesitation she frenched him again. Only now there was 
          yet another taste mixed in with the others, her own taste brought to 
          her by Greg's lips and tongue. 
        <P> "Let's face it, honey, you're going to be spending the rest of your 
          holiday getting fucked, so you may as well get used to the idea. You 
          ready for the first one now?" 
        <P> "Oh, Christ, yes!" 
        <P> "Then you'd better do something to put me in the mood again. Otherwise 
          I might decide to go and collect my shovel again." 
        <P> "I'd like to beat you over the head with that bloody shovel -- but 
          only after I've fucked you halfway to death first." 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "420" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/cnrr.jpg"> 
        <p> Greg snorted with glee and rolled over onto his back: "Oh well, if 
          you're going to play hard to get." 
        <P> Adele yelped out in mock frustration and went down on him as eagerly 
          as a fox let loose in a chook house. Snorting, her eyes blazing through 
          the tangle of her red hair, Adele drew on him as hard and strongly as 
          she could, challenging him to do his work. 
        <P> Greg's fingers roved across her buttocks, idly squeezing handfuls 
          of flesh and then lightly slapping her. Then they moved down and ran 
          along the edges of her wet lips. It was great, but it wasn't enough 
          and if she kept sucking him there was soon going to be nothing left 
          for where she needed it so badly. She wriggled away, then rolled over 
          on her back, spreading her legs wide open on the floor in obvious invitation. 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "506" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/2xx3.jpg"> 
        <p> And, just as she'd hoped, he snorted and spread himself on top of 
          her, guiding his huge cock into her. The sounds of total satisfaction 
          she made were as animal like as a jackal tearing at raw meat and she 
          didn't care at all. This was the best time she could remember ever having. 
        <P> "Greg, Greg, you lovely bastard, you ... " 
        <P> "I guess I'm just a real romeo at heart, sweetie. By the way, are 
          you sure you've washed all the sand out of your cunt?" 
        <P> Adele yelped with indignation. "I'll bury you with that fucking shovel!" 
        <P> "Ooops -- I hope I didn't say anything uncouth." 
        <P> <img align="left" WIDTH = "389" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/dean.jpg"> 
        <p> Adele was no longer interested in exchanging gibes, only in the sensations 
          which were exploding through her body as Greg became part of it, filling 
          and fulfilling her in ever deeper strokes. 
        <P> "Really ... no joking ... you're a great piece of ass, Adele. I've 
          got plans for you." 
        <P> "What plans?" 
        <P> "I'm gonna fuck you again tonight with Sapho watching us. She gets 
          off on having another girl with us. It'll be great." 
        <P> "I don't ... I don't believe you!" 
        <P> "It's true. She won't touch you, she just likes to watch. With a video 
          camera. It's a real inspiration." 
        <P> <img align="right" WIDTH = "533" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/fawn.jpg"> 
        <p> "You liar!" 
        <P> "And I take the tapes back to the mine site. All the guys do. We have 
          film shows for all the shift. I'll fuck your ass off with Sapho taping 
          it then show you off to the entire crew at work. Hey, if we're the best 
          fuck on the TV I'll win a carton of piss." 
        <P> "No ... " 
        <P> "Just ... have to ... come together ... like this!" 
        <P> Greg spurted into Adele like an earthquake setting off a peal of bells, 
          her voice calling out in triumph as they orgasmed as perfectly in time 
          as a conductor and a musician bringing out the last triumphant note 
          of a concert. 
        <p> Half fainting, she was vaguely aware of a cushion being put behind 
          her head. He loved her, he really did and somehow she was going to steal 
          him away from Sapho and they were going to spend the rest of their lives 
          walking Tasmanian beaches together -- it was a partnership made in heaven. 
          True love at last! 
              <P> <img WIDTH = "564" HEIGHT = "340" hspace="10"  border="2" src="Wined/Winedimages/y2aa.jpg"> 
              <p> "Hey, Adele." 
        <P> He was leaning back in one of the chairs, sipping from the glass of 
          wine he'd picked up. And he'd also brought in the phone handpiece. 
        <P> "Yes, lover?" 
        <p> He began tapping the keys on the phone: "What do you think would go 
          best with this wine? A straight Aussie pizza or the full works instead? 
          Jeez, I'm hungry."
