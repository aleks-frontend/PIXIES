First, all data in your file system will be deleted. Then, information about your realms will be read from the realms SQL table and written to the "search.realms.txt" file. Then, all web page records in addresses SQL table will be written to text files in the searchdata folder, one file per realm. The data migration might take several minutes, during which time this script may auto-refresh. Once the migration is complete, you will have identical data in your file system and in SQL. At that point, you can set Data Storage Method to File System, and searches will begin to be performed against the file system. Also, all admin actions like creating realms or indexing websites will be done against the text file data.

These character conversions are applied to both text being searched, and to the search terms themselves. After updating character conversion settings, all index files must be rebuilt. Otherwise, many searches will fail to bring up results.
Next, all characters are converted to a corresponding value from the four right columns below, based on the two character conversion settings above. A blank space in the right hand columns means that the character will be ignored.
First, all HTML entities are converted to their single-byte character equivalent.
These settings control how accented and upper-case characters are handled.

List Custom Records
<p><b>Note:</b> when you delete the persistent custom metadata, the records themselves remain intact with their current customized values. The only effect of deleting the custom data is that the record will once again have its title, description, and keywords parsed directly from the document when the record is re-indexed.</p><p>Note that using persistent custom metadata may significantly slow down the indexing process for all records. It is best to minimize the set of customized records, and to delete custom entries for any URL's which are no longer in the index.</p>
