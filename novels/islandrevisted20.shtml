              <p><p>
                As I stood atop the ledge of the highest cliff on the island, 
                I looked down and watched the ocean's waves crash into the large 
                boulders embedded there. There was a good 3,000 feet separating 
                myself and rock bottom, but I felt somewhat at ease surrounded 
                by the red sky as twilight settled in. For the first time since 
                yesterday, at least. Why? Well... this was the end of the road 
                for me.<p>
                Since Pamela left my life forever less than 24 hours ago, I had 
                given a lot of thought to everything which took place over the 
                past seven months. Perhaps she was right, and I had been too blind 
                to even see the most obvious things.<p>
                During the summer-time, there was such a feeling of camaraderie 
                amongst the girls. Pamela, Lindsay, Amy, Torrie, Trish, Lisa and 
                Christina - all of them, for the most part, got along so wonderfully. 
                There was such a sense of love and sharing amongst that group, 
                until Trish ultimately had her disagreement over Lindsay with 
                Amy near the end.<p>
                I did not count that, however, because mostly everything before 
                then had went so beautifully.<p>
                Of course, I wanted to re-create those happy feelings when bringing 
                Torrie, Amy and Trish back to the island for the winter, along 
                with newcomers Cassidy, Stephanie and Devon. They were to join 
                Lindsay, Pamela and myself - and my goal was to not have a single 
                problem between any of us.<p>
                But there had really been nothing but minor squabbles and heated 
                arguments amongst the ladies since the winter began. First, it 
                was Torrie and Amy - not so much of an argument, but simmering, 
                bitter feelings between the two. Torrie was angry at Amy, thinking 
                she had lured her into the porn industry while not caring about 
                her one bit. Torrie said that Amy only did it for her own good.<p>
                Then, of course, Torrie had her series of meltdowns once she learned 
                that Trish was coming back to the island. Torrie finally thought 
                she had a chance to get in with Lindsay - her secret crush in 
                life - but knew that went out the window once Trish - Lindsay's 
                favorite lady - made her triumphant return to the island.<p>
                Who could forget Devon and my suspicions about her? I thought 
                she had her sights set on harming my marriage with Pamela, and 
                I came within an eyelash of sending her home because of it. I 
                had a nice, long talk with her, though, and we ironed everything 
                out.<p>
                There was the infamous night when Pamela basically beat Devon 
                up too, and bloodied her in the process. Pamela was afraid that 
                Devon was out to end our marriage as well (which I found quite 
                peculiar now, considering what happened here yesterday), thanks 
                to Cassidy and her false rumors.<p>
                Things between Devon and Pamela were eventually smoothed out, 
                but the complications of that evening still seemed to linger between 
                them until the very end. Of course, I sent Cassidy - who admitted 
                to being a compulsive liar - home without even a second thought.<p>
                Things kind of exploded once Pamela snapped at Lindsay - of all 
                people - telling her that she wanted to spend the evening alone 
                with Trish. The end result of the discussion between Pamela and 
                Trish was that I no longer had a wife, because Lindsay's soulmate 
                had run off to Canada with her.<p>
                Just a single thought about the horrific events of yesterday sent 
                absolute shivers down my spine. While standing atop that cliff 
                which overlooked the ocean, I watched a flock of seagulls drift 
                by. What was it like, I thought to myself, to be able to fly so 
                freely?<p>
                Of course, here I stood - a shell of the man I was just 24 hours 
                ago. My wife had left me for another woman, and I didn't even 
                see it coming. I was too blind, too naive. My ex-fiancee, Victoria... 
                she left me for another woman, too.<p>
                I never thought I could have had a more worse, pitiful feeling 
                than I did when Victoria left me standing at the altar some eight 
                years ago. However, Pamela saying that my marriage with her was 
                nothing more than a mistake and then her leaving me for another 
                woman - just like Victoria did - the feelings within me were a 
                million times worse.<p>
                Dear, sweet, little Lindsay... she had not stopped crying since 
                the events of yesterday. I felt terrible for her because Trish 
                had stabbed her in the back, and then ripped her heart out again 
                - just like in the summer-time. Lindsay deserved nothing bad to 
                happen to her. Seeing her in pain only added to my own pain...<p>
                What I once thought of as island paradise had suddenly been transformed 
                into an island of bickering and horror. Arguments and problems 
                were abound since the winter began, and then that absolute bomb 
                was dropped yesterday.<p>
                I had worked so hard to promote a feeling of togetherness and 
                love amongst the girls... but failed. Even where what I once thought 
                of as my &quot;save haven&quot; in life - this island - I had 
                failed. I felt so sick inside that it actually hurt.<p>
                I took a deep breath while watching one of the waves crash into 
                the series of thick, jagged rocks below me. The sounds being created 
                were peaceful, but I knew what I was debating in my mind right 
                now was anything but.<p>
                &quot;Jump,&quot; I said to myself.<p>
                Why not? Pamela had tore my heart out and sent it through a meat 
                grinder with what she did to me yesterday. It was bad enough that 
                Pamela left. It was even worse when she claimed she never really 
                loved me in the first place. Our marriage, in her own words, was 
                a mistake.<p>
                &quot;Jump,&quot; I told myself again. &quot;Do it.&quot;<p>
                Without me to ruin her life, Lindsay would be with her<p>
                family right now in Ohio. She would be a college student and, 
                of course, the most popular co-ed on campus. Lindsay would be 
                leading a much happier life if I had never brought her here, and 
                ruined it for her. She wouldn't have had to go through all this 
                bickering and heartache.<p>
                She would have never met Trish, and her life would be better now 
                because of it.<p>
                &quot;Jump, you loser,&quot; I said, getting more and more agitated 
                with myself. &quot;End it. End it now. Jump!&quot;<p>
                If I were to take a swan-dive off of that 3,000 foot cliff, I 
                would leave Lindsay and the other remaining girls - Amy, Torrie, 
                Devon and Stephanie - behind.<p>
                &quot;They'll find their way,&quot; I summarized outloud. &quot;All 
                it will take is a call to the mainland authorities.&quot;<p>
                Of course, the main reason why I was contemplating suicide at 
                this very moment in time was because of the extreme pain and hurt 
                which had flooded my body. I just couldn't live like this. I gave 
                everything that I could possibly give to Pamela - and she said 
                our marriage had been a mistake.<p>
                I shook my head while looking downward. There was no need to have 
                a second thought about Pamela, or anything else that happened 
                to me. It was too painful, and not worth my time. None of this, 
                in fact, was worth my time.<p>
                &quot;Jump. You'll be in a better place because of it. End the 
                pain. No one will care that you did it, anyway.&quot;<p>
                I closed my eyes and prepared to do the unthinkable...</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>&quot;JEREMY!&quot;<p>
                The loud, deafening scream sounded like a firecracker had just 
                went off. &quot;JEREMY!&quot; Opening my eyes and taking a step 
                back from the ledge, I turned around and noticed Lindsay running 
                toward me as fast as she could. &quot;JEREMY...&quot; she said 
                once in front of me, leaning over and holding onto her knees, 
                trying to catch her breath.<p>
                &quot;What are you doing here, Lindsay?&quot; I asked her, angry.<p>
                I was too irrational to feel otherwise.<p>
                &quot;I... f-found you... with the voyeur room,&quot; she replied, 
                still short of breath. &quot;Whew... what a run. Where have you 
                been all day? We've been worried si-sick!&quot;<p>
                &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; I reiterated, my arms folded.<p>
                &quot;Oh my God...&quot; Lindsay said, looking up at me and shaking<p>
                her head. &quot;You were going to do it. Weren't you?&quot; She 
                paused and added, &quot;You were going to... jump.&quot;<p>
                I held back a laugh and countered, &quot;So? It's not like anyone 
                is going to miss me.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I'd miss you, Jeremy,&quot; the 19-year-old said, reaching 
                out and lightly grasping my wrist with her hand.<p>
                &quot;No you wouldn't,&quot; I told her, my mind too hazed to 
                think straight. &quot;No you wouldn't. No one would.&quot;<p>
                &quot;How can you say that, Jeremy?&quot; she asked, looking hurt.<p>
                &quot;Maybe because it's the truth?&quot; I told her. &quot;No 
                one<p>
                cares what happens to me. No one ever has. First it was Victoria, 
                and now Pamela. No one cares.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I'm not Victoria or Pamela,&quot; Lindsay countered, shaking 
                her head in the process. &quot;I'd never hurt you, Jeremy.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I thought the same way about them,&quot; I said, turning 
                my face to the side. &quot;I thought I was going to grow old with 
                Victoria. We were going to have kids, a happy family. But it never 
                happened. Pamela? We were going to spend the rest of our lives 
                together in paradise. A beautiful, tropical paradise. I loved 
                her. But she simply tolerated me. Our marriage, she said... it 
                was a MISTAKE.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I love you, Jeremy,&quot; Lindsay shrieked, tears forming 
                in her eyes. &quot;I'd never do a thing to hurt you...&quot;<p>
                &quot;Go back to the mansion, Lindsay, and let me do what I have 
                to do,&quot; I told her bluntly, my mind still too whacked. &quot;The 
                pain will be gone. I'll be in a better place.&quot;<p>
                The little blonde looked at me for several seconds, and then started 
                to cry. Still too intent on what I wanted to do myself, I did 
                not pay her a lot of attention. I turned my face to look back 
                down at the rocks thousands of feet below, but then got a rather 
                harsh wake-up call.<p>
                Lindsay grabbed ahold of my shoulders and steered me away from 
                the ledge, then extended her right hand and slapped me across 
                the face as hard as she possibly could.<p>
                &quot;DAMNIT, JEREMY!&quot; she exploded, my eyes wide in response. 
                &quot;WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING? Look at what happened to 
                me, will you?&quot; She punched my shoulder and continued, &quot;Look 
                at what happened to me! NOT ONLY DID I LOSE TRISH, BUT I ALSO 
                LOST PAMELA! In the same day! I LOVED TRISH SO MUCH, AND PAMELA 
                WAS MY SECOND-FAVORITE AMONGST THE GIRLS! I've spent nearly seven 
                months of my life with Pamela! MY GOD, JEREMY... YOU LOST YOUR 
                WIFE, BUT I LOST TWO PEOPLE! I'M NOT STANDING AT A CLIFF, READY 
                TO JUMP OFF!&quot;<p>
                I was too stunned to even say anything in response to her.<p>
                I had NEVER seen Lindsay so harsh and angry before...<p>
                &quot;I can't stop you,&quot; she said seconds later, her voice 
                much more calm and relaxed. &quot;Not physically, at least. But 
                if you jump, Jeremy... I'll follow you down. I'll jump, too.&quot;<p>
                &quot;WHAT?&quot; I managed to get out, taken completely off-guard.<p>
                &quot;I'm not losing the three most important people in my<p>
                life, in less than a 24 hour span,&quot; she replied, starting 
                to cry again. &quot;Pamela and Trish were bad enough. But... I 
                can't lose you too, Jeremy. It would destroy me. I... I couldn't 
                handle that. I... just couldn't.&quot;<p>
                Lindsay's slap to my face, followed by her punch upon my shoulder 
                and then those powerful words... Fortunately, she had managed 
                to bring back my sanity. And, there wasn't a better time for her 
                to pound some sense into me than now...<p>
                &quot;I'll jump right after you do,&quot; she reiterated, shaking 
                her head through a sheet of tears. &quot;I love you, Jeremy. I 
                love you more than anything. I haven't always said or expressed 
                that as much as I'd like, because Pamela was your wife and I didn't 
                want to cause friction.&quot; Lindsay shook her head once more 
                and started crying even harder. &quot;I'm not losing you too, 
                Jeremy. I'll go to Heaven or Hell with you, either way. You jump... 
                and I jump.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I love you too, sweetheart,&quot; I told her after several 
                seconds of silence. Finally, I had regained my mind. &quot;I... 
                you... you saved my life.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I know how much it h-hurts...&quot; Lindsay cried, stepping 
                forward and hugging me. She jammed the side of her face into my 
                chest and continued, &quot;I feel it just like you d-do, Jeremy. 
                Pamela was your wife, but Trish was a wife to me. I lost her, 
                and Pamela too. Pamela was... my best friend.&quot;<p>
                Lindsay broke off our embrace and looked into my eyes, saying, 
                &quot;B-But you know wh-what? Even though both of them stabbed 
                us in the back... we'll make it through. You and me, Jeremy. We'll 
                do it... t-together.&quot;<p>
                As the 19-year-old's cries reached their apex, it was if her legs 
                had given out underneath her. Lindsay crumpled to the ground, 
                and I went down with her. I hugged her tightly and started to 
                cry myself. &quot;As long as I am with you, sweet thing... yes, 
                we'll make it through,&quot; I said. &quot;Together...&quot;<p>
                Lindsay and I cried together, embracing one another tightly, for 
                a good ten minutes. At the same time, I openly wondered to myself 
                if this was the person - Lindsay - that I should have been with 
                from the very beginning.<p>
                Lindsay saved my life...</p>
