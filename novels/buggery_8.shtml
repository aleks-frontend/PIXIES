              <p>&quot;What do the men do? Don't they ever want sex or anything?&quot; 
                wondered Tracey. She couldn't imagine how men could get by without 
                the basic things in life.<p>
                &quot;Well, there's always prostitution if they want sex. Most 
                women do it at least some of the time. It's the nearest to proper 
                loving sex that you can have with a man here. And it's more remunerative 
                than working in a factory or as a servant. Women aren't allowed 
                to own money: and anyway there's nowhere we can spend it. So all 
                you get is food. When you sell your body you can get hold of drugs, 
                alcohol, medicines and all the other things you can't get hold 
                of otherwise.&quot;<p>
                &quot;So the only way men have of having sex is by going with 
                a prostitute?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well, they can have sex with each other. The Republic of 
                Gomorrah actively encourages men to do that. They regularly have 
                big campaigns where they try to persuade men that that is the 
                right and proper thing to do. The more purist male separatists 
                clearly find heterosexuality somehow offensive and threatening. 
                But however much propaganda there is, most men seem to prefer 
                fucking women. And, I guess, even though it's not often very pleasant, 
                even most women somehow prefer it that way. Of course, they can 
                just rape us. There's no law preventing them doing so, and there 
                are clearly quite a few men who actually prefer rape. And, of 
                course, rape usually involves other kinds of violence as well. 
                Most of us have been raped once or twice a year: and some unlucky 
                ones, much more often than that. It doesn't help to be too attractive 
                to the men. They somehow think it's some kind of provocation.&quot; 
                She smiled sympathetically at Buttercup. &quot;I'm sure you'll 
                find out all about that when that bruise on your face goes down.&quot;<p>
                &quot;So men are free to rape us whenever they like?&quot; gasped 
                Tracey, who was still feeling acutely the bruises and humiliations 
                sustained during the border crossing.<p>
                &quot;Well, yes,&quot; admitted Delta. &quot;But not all men. 
                Even though they can, most men don't. They prefer paying for sex. 
                It's more pleasant for them as well as for us: even if they are 
                a bit clumsy and awkward. And all they ever seem to know about 
                is fucking. They never do anything else. Up the cunt. Up the arse. 
                A hand job or a blow job. It's pretty predictable, doesn't take 
                very long, and it means you can do quite a few men in a single 
                night. Even quite a few in a single hour. Some women complain 
                about men's lack of imagination and sensitivity, but it does make 
                it easier and more profitable.&quot; Delta smiled conspiratorially, 
                and then leaned under her wooden-framed bed to reveal a bottle 
                of whisky. &quot;Look what one of them gave me the other night. 
                And all I had to do was let him piss on me. Do you fancy a sip?&quot;<p>
                Delta passed the bottle over to Tracey who greedily gulped down 
                a mouthful. Fuck! Alcohol! She'd forgotten how fucking good it 
                was! Now all she needed were some ciggies and a cheeseburger and 
                she'd really feel fine. She passed the bottle to Buttercup who 
                politely declined, and then back to Delta who pointedly took a 
                rather smaller sip, and carefully placed it back under the bed.<p>
                &quot;Well, now we need to find somewhere for you to stay. And 
                tomorrow I'll take you to one of the factories near here where 
                you can get a job. That way you can at least get something to 
                eat. We don't have enough food to spare for very long, I'm afraid. 
                You can last till tomorrow can't you?&quot;<p>
                Buttercup nodded, although Tracey felt her hunger quite acutely. 
                The taste of alcohol had aroused her appetite, and she was now 
                acutely aware of how little she'd had to eat since she'd left 
                Throb. She sighed to herself, but accepted that she was now totally 
                indebted to Delta.<p>
                Delta led them through the village, introducing the girls to other 
                women, similarly hirsute and naked, who all had names with numbers. 
                It seemed to be a Gomorran thing. Epsilon Nine One Two One. Omicron 
                Five Six Seven Two. Tau Seven Three Two Three. These apparently 
                were the names that the girls had stamped on them at birth just 
                before they were abandoned to the elements and whichever woman 
                took pity on them. It was also the only kind of name that the 
                Gomorran men would use to address them: if it ever crossed their 
                mind to use a name at all.<p>
                A young girl called Theta Seven Six Seven Five showed the girls 
                to a small hut made from cardboard, corrugated iron and brushwood. 
                She had long blonde hair, blue green eyes and a slightly twisted 
                nose. She smiled continuously. &quot;I only built this hut, yesterday,&quot; 
                she said proudly. &quot;I'm in the housing committee. We're always 
                building huts and repairing other huts. I get food from the other 
                women for that, so it means I don't have to go to the Men Only 
                areas for work or sex.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Do you prefer that?&quot; asked Buttercup gently.<p>
                &quot;Oh! Very much. I'm always getting raped when I go to work. 
                It's really horrid. I wish I was older or not so good looking. 
                The men are always doing horrid things to me. Last time, one man 
                made me eat his shit and then he kicked me in the face and breasts. 
                You can see what he did to my nose. I hate men! I never want to 
                see one of those bastards again. If I could, I'd kill every fucking 
                last one of them! They hate us and I hate them!&quot;<p>
                Theta continued smiling as she spoke, expressing her strength 
                of feeling only by her choice of words and not by her expression. 
                &quot;I hope this hut's to your taste. It faces the sun in the 
                morning, so you should be up early to go to the factory. You'll 
                be going with my lover, Zeta. Zeta Four Seven Three Seven, that 
                is. She works at the chicken packing factory. So we always have 
                chicken in our hut. Every day.&quot;<p>
                Theta led Buttercup and Tracey to a hut through whose shaky walls 
                rays of light from the sun easily entered and whose roof offered 
                the barest protection from wind and rain. It was secure enough 
                for either girl to lean against the wall for it not to collapse 
                on top of them, but clearly a storm of any strength would smash 
                it to pieces. The floor was covered in straw and grass, but otherwise 
                it was wholly bare. However, the girls were so tired and exhausted, 
                that this was more than adequate. Tracey smiled at Buttercup and 
                held her to her chest.<p>
                &quot;Oh! We're here at last! Safe and sound and together!&quot;<p>
                Buttercup smiled more wanly. She was clearly troubled by all that 
                Delta had told them, but she chose not to voice her concerns. 
                She cupped her hands behind Tracey's neck, her fingernails into 
                her nape and pushed her face right up to her lover. She turned 
                her head slightly to one side, probed with her tongue on Tracey's 
                lips and as her lover gave her familiar gasp of ecstatic anticipation, 
                she clasped her mouth tightly to her lover's. Tracey pulled Buttercup 
                to her, her hands exploring the contours of the beautiful woman's 
                body underneath the long flowing, slightly matted, golden hair. 
                The delicate contours of her shoulder blades. The precious and 
                delicate nobbled spine, which descended from her slightly arched 
                neck and sank down her back until finally sinking into a pit above 
                her gloriously round, smooth golden buttocks. Unlike her own, 
                these were buttocks ample enough to hide the contours of her hip, 
                but not too ample to detract from her essential slimness.<p>
                Her hands grasped Buttercup's buttocks, and then, inevitably, 
                curiosity and desire and longing being what they were, her fingers 
                sought out the mound of pleasure where her lover's short stubble 
                raised above her vagina. And with a gasp of delight and pleasure 
                she discovered that, yes! Buttercup's vagina was moist and welcoming. 
                &quot;Oh! Buttercup! Buttercup!&quot; she gasped, easing her lover 
                onto her knees and then onto her back, as her fingers pushed in 
                and out of the moist, fleshy wonderfulness of it all. &quot;I 
                love you! I love you!&quot; she cried again, as Buttercup swivelled 
                round her body, so that she could lick Tracey's vagina while Tracey 
                was able to reciprocate from above. <p>
                Tracey parted the delicate golden lips and momentarily paused 
                to wonder at what she could see, all the while feeling Buttercup's 
                tongue expertly lapping on her clitoris. Buttercup's vagina opened 
                like a fig. The clitoris emerged hard, short and majestic above 
                the folds of her vulva, and there as her probing finger established 
                again was the hole into which so many pricks had entered, and 
                now was hers. She winced as she reflected on the border guards' 
                pricks who'd so recently violated her lover, as they had also 
                violated her, and she fancied she could taste some of the caked 
                blood and semen on her lover's vaginal stubble. But now it was 
                hers, as her own vagina was Buttercup's, so she let her tongue 
                rasp against the shadow of blonde hair that grew around her nose 
                while a finger explored the caverns of her lover's anus. Yes, 
                she reflected, as she sniffed her finger after it had entered 
                as far inside the tight pursed hole as it could, Buttercup definitely 
                shits. And, as the odd taste amongst the rich smells emerging 
                from her vagina confirmed, she almost certainly pisses as well. 
                But perfection is only human. And from her own lower regions she 
                felt Buttercup's own fingers, teeth and tongue explore her own 
                vagina. She briefly reflected on her shit-smelling finger. Why 
                do men like anal intercourse so much? The arse is nowhere as beautiful 
                as the cunt. Nothing to it! A hole with a small puckered entrance 
                and an unpleasant smell. None of the odour, delicacy, flower-like 
                elaborateness of a cunt. Perhaps that was because all men wanted 
                was a hole, and they didn't appreciate the finer things.<p>
                As of course she did. Now she was with her lover, in the shadows 
                of the hut, on the dry coarse straws of the hut's floor, enjoying 
                the best sex of her life with the best lover she could ever imagine.<p>
                XIV
              <p>It started as a day like all the others as far as Sharon was 
                concerned. In fact, in her misery she had lost all concept of 
                days. Life was nothing but boredom and fear punctuated by rape. 
                Only a few hours earlier Sweetness and she had had to endure another 
                assault by the Buggery soldiers. Again ones she'd never seen before 
                with the exception of the sergeant who escorted them in. She was 
                vaguely aware of the violence done to her through her tears and 
                pain. Her arse hadn't recovered from the previous assault which 
                had already left a trickle of blood between her buttocks. Her 
                vagina was similarly bruised and battered. And yet more pummelling. 
                She could see Sweetness' face pressed against the ground like 
                her own, a leg hooked over her back while another soldier squeezed 
                his penis into his arse. She could see the other soldiers fucking 
                each other and could hear the gasps and pants of the soldiers 
                as they penetrated her. She had long given up struggling. It only 
                made it hurt more. All she could look forward to was the pain 
                ending, and then being left huddled in a slump to nurse her sorrows. 
                Sometimes she saw enough of the soldiers from the undignified 
                positions in which they'd held her down to see just how young 
                and sometimes mutilated they were. She knew that their sufferings 
                in this war had also been considerable, and the scars and dismemberments 
                were proof, if proof were needed that war was no more pleasant 
                for the combatants than it was for innocents like her who had 
                been dragged into its sphere.<p>
                And then, hours of solitude with Sweetness whose tears of grief 
                for Joy were intermingled with rage against the men who had treated 
                her so badly. It was evening, so only a shadowy form of Sweetness 
                could be seen in the narrow light passing through the tent's closed 
                entrance. Sharon sat with her knees pulled up to her chest and 
                her arms nestling around her legs, staring into space, depressed, 
                anxious and bruised. How long would she last until she was discarded 
                or worn out? It was while these dark thoughts ran through her 
                mind that she was suddenly startled by a loud bang and a sudden 
                burst of light which briefly illuminated the contours of Sweetness' 
                recumbent white form. <p>
                Thunder and lightening, presumed Sharon. But no, there wasn't 
                any rain. The little patch of sky she could see through the tent 
                door was clear. And then another crash. Not too far away. And 
                the sound of running outside. What was happening? In the tent, 
                all she knew of was frantic activity outside, the occasional thundering 
                crash and accompanying flash of light. And then the sound of gunfire.<p>
                &quot;Oh No! Oh No! We're gonna die! We're going to die!&quot; 
                cried Sharon in utter fear, a patch of urine suddenly releasing 
                itself from between her legs and squirting onto the ground beneath 
                her. <p>
                Sweetness moaned. &quot;What's happening? What's going on? What's 
                happening?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I don't know,&quot; admitted Sharon, conscious only that 
                whatever it was, it was dangerous and potentially lethal.<p>
                The noise and confusion only intensified. The gunfire became an 
                almost continuous rattle as it progressed to machine guns and 
                hand automatics. Every few moments there was a shriek or a thump 
                or a crash. The tent was illuminated after and during each new 
                noise, and Sharon could see Sweetness in those few instances lit 
                up and crouched. She despaired. &quot;I'm gonna die! I'm gonna 
                die!&quot; she moaned unable to hear her own voice over the cacophony, 
                and distantly aware of similar shrieks and cries erupting from 
                Sweetness. Sharon rolled herself into a ball, hid her head into 
                her arms and like a mantra moaned: &quot;Die! I'm gonna. Die!&quot; 
                She could hear soldiers running about outside. At one stage, the 
                tent shook as a body fell against it and then slumped to the ground. 
                Sharon yelped with terror. When would she be next?<p>
                &quot;Sharon! Sharon!&quot; she distantly heard. She looked up 
                to see the shadowy figure of the sergeant. He was crouching down, 
                but Sharon could see that his penis was fully erect between his 
                legs. <p>
                &quot;Not now! For fuck's sake not now!&quot; Sharon pleaded, 
                afraid that she was about to be raped.<p>
                &quot;I love you, Sharon,&quot; said the sergeant in a voice hollowed 
                out by excitement. &quot;I love you. I only wish we'd met in &#133; 
                in better circumstances.&quot; Sharon gazed at the figure when 
                there was another monstrous crash which shook the tent and briefly 
                lit the sergeant up. He was clearly excited, and not just his 
                penis. Sharon noticed a gash on his leg and a swelling of flesh 
                and blood. The sergeant slightly hobbled. &quot;If we ever meet 
                again .. if I survive &#133; I'd so like to meet you again &#133; 
                but, for now, you must run. Run away!&quot;<p>
                Sharon was conscious that the shackle around her ankle was being 
                taken off and suddenly she was freed. Her ankle felt sore, but 
                it was also free. Then, as she crouched, rubbing her ankle and 
                wondering what to do, she watched as the sergeant unclasped Sweetness' 
                ankle and then both of them were free. <p>
                &quot;You must run! Both of you! The Gomorrans. They're here. 
                Soon they'll be in this tent. And they'll kill you! You must leave! 
                Now!&quot;<p>
                The sergeant tugged Sharon up, who was unsteady from so many days 
                of lying down. And weak from eating so badly. And bruised and 
                battered from her multiple rapes. He grabbed Sharon by the arm 
                and pulled up Sweetness who was terrified and weeping. He pulled 
                them out of the tent, hobbling on his wounded leg.<p>
                &quot;I have to fight! You have to run!&quot; the sergeant shouted 
                urgently. Sharon was startled by the brightness and confusion 
                of the camp outside which she'd only glimpsed when she'd been 
                dragged in. All around were Buggery soldiers running naked with 
                their erect penises, with guns in their arms. On the ground were 
                the bodies of other soldiers. Some tents were burning, and there 
                was smoke drifting across the landscape. She could vaguely see 
                the shadows of jeeps in the distance driving around through the 
                smoke. And all around was the sound of gunfire and the occasional 
                whistle as bullets shot by uncomfortably close.<p>
                The sergeant pushed Sharon and Sweetness away from him. &quot;That 
                way! There's a wood. Only a hundred yards! Run!&quot;<p>
                Sharon looked around her with startled open eyes, aware that her 
                chances were lessening by the second. Without a word, she grabbed 
                Sweetness by the arm and pulled her roughly with her as she ran 
                almost as blindly as Sweetness in the dark void where the sergeant 
                pointed. As they ran, they occasionally glimpsed soldiers lying 
                on the ground and others running in all directions. She was unsure 
                of where she trod, and felt the rough earth acutely as her bare 
                feet raced onwards. Despite her blindness, Sweetness was keeping 
                up with her, moaning but not complaining. <p>
                And then, they were into some woodland. But Sharon kept running, 
                aware that this was only shelter in the most temporary sense. 
                They ran over through the dark shadows, gashing their ankles and 
                their thighs on the brambles and thicket. Gradually, the sound 
                of gunfire became more distant, but the explosions when they occurred 
                were loud, threatening and shook even the tall trees around them.<p>
                Sharon ran and ran, her breath short and painful. And then she 
                noticed an opening in the trees through which the moon was shining. 
                Sharon guided Sweetness through the trees, and put an arm around 
                the girl.<p>
                &quot;We've escaped. We may be safe,&quot; she whispered. Sweetness 
                looked up her, gazing with sightless, tearful eyes.<p>
                &quot;I hope so! I hope so!&quot; she whispered.<p>
                However, when they got to the edge of the wood, Sharon could see 
                that they were still far from being as safe as she'd hoped. Outside 
                a full battle was in action. Buggery soldiers were running about, 
                their erect penises silhouetted grotesquely against the moon. 
                Gomorran soldiers in jeeps were also in evidence, firing at the 
                Buggery soldiers from their jeeps. A large tank was charging over 
                the dried barren earth, crunching over the bodies of dead soldiers, 
                occasionally releasing explosions of fire into those soldiers 
                who were running about. Sharon was suddenly aware that the tank 
                was heading towards the woods where they were, and might soon 
                be on them. She wasn't sure that the trees would offer it much 
                of an obstacle.<p>
                She squeezed Sweetness' shoulder. &quot;We have to keep running. 
                It's dangerous here.&quot; Sweetness nodded, and joined Sharon 
                as she led her back into the wood.<p>
                However, it was not long until Sharon's exhaustion became the 
                better of her, and she and Sweetness were reduced to staggering 
                through the dark dismal wood, not knowing where they were going, 
                only knowing what they were running away from. The sound of explosions 
                became more infrequent and more distant, and she was now more 
                conscious of the deadness and silence of where they were. But 
                tired as she was, she and Sweetness continued walking and stumbling 
                in the dark. Neither said much to each other, although Sweetness 
                clung to Sharon's arm or hand so tightly that Sharon could feel 
                the girl's nails dig deep into her flesh.<p>
                The girls walked on and on, until they could walk no more. And 
                then, hoping that it was safe, Sharon settled on a spot underneath 
                a tall tree around which was mostly grass and moss, and although 
                it was slightly damp in the night chill, she gently eased Sweetness 
                down to join her in the dark for the rest that her body demanded 
                of her. Sweetness sighed and pulled herself onto Sharon's body 
                for comfort and warmth. Sharon had neither the energy nor the 
                cruelty to push her off.<p>
                In fact, their bodies were the only shelter they had from the 
                chill. They held each other tightly, seeking solace in each other's 
                arms, Sweetness' head buried in Sharon's lap and Sharon's head 
                resting on Sweetness' back. Sleep was elusive and fitful, but 
                when it finally came, brought relief of a kind that Sharon had 
                not known for many days.<p>
                It was serenely and blissfully peaceful when Sharon woke up. The 
                light from the sun lit up the green and brown forest, revealing 
                the many pretty blue and yellow flowers that she'd not seen the 
                night before. The sun's heat burnt on her bare back and Sweetness 
                was clasped closely to her: her arms looping beneath hers and 
                around her back, her face close to her own, and their legs entwined 
                together. Sweetness stirred and opened her eyes. The pale sightless 
                eyes gazed at her through the wild hair that had fallen onto her 
                face.<p>
                &quot;Oh Sharon! You saved me! I'm alive! How can I thank you?&quot;<p>
                Sharon sighed. &quot;It's not over yet,&quot; she said miserably. 
                The darkness that had engulfed her in the days of rape and abuse 
                in the tent was not that easily lifted. But she appreciated Sweetness' 
                tender affection. The girl put her arms onto Sharon's shoulders 
                and pushed her face into Sharon's. She kissed her full on the 
                mouth, her tongue just emerging and about to enter between Sharon's 
                lips. Sharon gently pushed Sweetness away.<p>
                &quot;Oh! Sharon! I love you. I love you,&quot; said Sweetness 
                sadly.<p>
                Sharon was not pleased to hear this. &quot;I'm not a dyke,&quot; 
                she reminded Sweetness. &quot;Just keep your fucking hands off 
                me! Well, not your hands. But your tongue anyway.&quot; She was 
                distantly aware of Sweetness' hands probing between her legs and 
                then a finger stroking the short hairs of her crotch around the 
                cunt-ring, which was all she had to wear. Sharon brushed Sweetness' 
                hand away, gently and sympathetically. &quot;And whatever you 
                do, don't put your hand there.&quot;<p>
                Sweetness weeped. &quot;But I love you. You saved my life.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I don't fucking care! It's men I want &#133; well, not all 
                men &#133;&quot; she mused, thinking of the regular abuse she'd 
                so recently become nearly accustomed to, &quot;but men anyway 
                &#133; not women. Do you understand?&quot;<p>
                Sweetness bent her head down, her hair cascading onto her hands 
                and over her skinny breasts. Her bony limbs seemed so vulnerable 
                in the sun, as she pushed her clasped hands down between the angles 
                of her knees. &quot;No, I don't,&quot; Sweetness admitted. &quot;I 
                don't understand at all. Joy always made love to me. Why don't 
                you? What's wrong with me? Don't you like me? Do I look so horrible?&quot; 
                <p>
                Sharon was aware that tears were running down Sweetness' nose, 
                and one droplet hung precipitously from its end. But she couldn't 
                relent. It wasn't right. &quot;Come on, Sweetness,&quot; she said 
                gently, putting a hand on Sweetness' own clasped ones. &quot;We 
                have enough to do. We have to somehow find things to eat. And 
                we've got to get away from here.&quot; She lifted Sweetness' head 
                up by her chin and gazed into her face. The girl was quite pretty, 
                if horribly malnourished. The cuts and bruises on her face detracted 
                from her attractiveness. Her cheeks were sunk in, there was a 
                dark mark around one of her eyes, and her lips were cracked and 
                the lower one slightly split. &quot;We must get moving.&quot;<p>
                &quot;But where to?&quot; wondered Sweetness standing up above 
                her unsteady and slightly wobbly. Sharon gazed up at the unshaven 
                triangle between her legs, the sharp angles of her hips and the 
                caved-in stomach. An overwhelming sadness came over her, colouring 
                her darkness with a fresh sense of foreboding.<p>
                &quot;I don't know. I don't fucking know!&quot;<p>
                Without Buttercup or Tracey, Sharon felt even more hopeless than 
                she had before. And her responsibilities towards this blind girl 
                may have given her a sense of purpose, but that didn't make her 
                any more capable. Their wanderings through the day and the days 
                to come were aimless, meandering and uncoordinated. They wandered 
                in and out of the woods. Sometimes walking along the empty roads. 
                Sometimes straying towards the battle zones where bombed-out tanks 
                and abandoned vehicles gave evidence of potential danger. <p>
                On a few occasions they saw the bodies of soldiers rotting in 
                the sun, surrounded by the buzz of insects and the gathering of 
                horribly slimy things around them. On one occasion, they even 
                saw the body of a soldier fully clothed, with maggots and flies 
                crawling through the fabric. This was the first time Sharon had 
                seen anyone, alive or dead, with clothes on, and this acutely 
                reminded her of her nakedness. She looked down disparagingly at 
                her bruised and lacerated body, her bare vagina a kind of affront 
                to her sensibilities. Would she ever wear clothes again? And lead 
                a normal life? She looked at Sweetness, who was staring blankly 
                ahead, her hand, as always, tightly grasped in hers. She was discomfited 
                more by the horrible smell from the corpse than by its sight. 
                Sharon felt overwhelmed by a sense of sadness and something else 
                she had been resisting so strongly. She tenderly kissed Sweetness 
                on the cheek, who started slightly alarmed, and then smiled as 
                she established what had touched her. Sharon gently eased the 
                girl off as she tried to reciprocate the affection.<p>
                Sharon was completely hopeless at the task of finding and preparing 
                food, and Sweetness was understandably even worse. As the days 
                and nights went by, a succession of wandering punctuated by exhaustion, 
                the two got weaker and their wanderings more fitful. Every time 
                they saw figures in the distance, the girls hid either flat on 
                the ground or in the thickets, terrified that they might be seen 
                by soldiers or, worse, police. Sharon's self-confidence dropped 
                and her despair intensified. But still the sun shone, the landscape 
                alternated between the bleak barrenness of the open fields and 
                the forbidding shadows of the forests.<p>
                Those times that they had the energy to stumble forwards became 
                steadily shorter, and the times they rested became longer. Soon, 
                Sharon leaned more and more heavily on Sweetness, who was steadily 
                losing her passion for her guardian as her own energy levels dropped 
                further. Sharon's awareness of where she was became increasingly 
                more tenuous. When they rested, their consciousness slid away 
                so easily, and stirring became even more difficult. The sun burnt 
                on Sharon's back and shoulders and her legs became increasingly 
                lacerated as her stumbling became more faltering and more unsteady. 
                And soon they weren't walking at all.<p>
                Sharon wasn't at all sure how long she and Sweetness had been 
                lying on the earth in the shade of the large tree. They were clinging 
                to each other in desperation, Sweetness occasionally shivering 
                as fatigue and hunger shook through her body. Sharon's mouth was 
                dry and her lips cracked. The few fruits and the odd mushroom 
                they'd eaten hadn't really been enough to sustain them with either 
                nourishment or moisture. And then she felt a hand on her shoulder. 
                She assumed it was Sweetness, and opened her eyes surprised to 
                see that both of the girl's hands were clinging to her shoulders, 
                her eyes closed and one leg pushed out ungainly away from them.<p>
                Sharon started. She mouthed &quot;What the fuck!&quot; and looked 
                up at the possessor of the strange hand, expecting to see a Buggery 
                soldier with his erect penis and khaki skin. Instead she saw the 
                face of a woman with her hair shaved off and a strangely reassuring 
                smile under a small nose disfigured by a huge nose-ring.<p>
                &quot;Who are you?&quot;<p>
                The woman offered Sharon a bowl of water which she was holding 
                in her other hands. Sharon took it from her and gulped it down 
                greedily, and as she did so glimpsed the hands which had proffered 
                the bowl to her. They were slim white hands with the third finger 
                on the left hand cut off at just about the lower joint. She looked 
                up and evaluated this strange angel of mercy. It then became clear. 
                The naked body, the chains running from the pierced nipples and 
                the shaven vagina. The crouched figure was a Sodomite pilgrim.<p>
                The woman smiled again, and opened her mouth voicelessly. It was 
                with an acute sense of discomfort and unease that Sharon realised 
                that there was no tongue in the mouth behind the sparkling white 
                teeth, or rather only the stump of a tongue. And this Sodomite 
                pilgrim was not alone. There were three or four others: one male, 
                the other female, all naked bar the chains and rings from piercings 
                all about their bodies. They were all smiling at her. Despite 
                herself, Sharon smiled back.<p>
                The woman who'd given her the water was crouched beside her, the 
                chains from her nipples resting on her knees. She placed a hand 
                on Sharon's lips and then pulled herself forward to kiss her gently 
                and tenderly on the lips. A very warm and brief kiss. She then 
                gently raised the bowl of water to Sharon's mouth.<p>
                Sharon sipped some more and looked up at the solicitous and kindly 
                gaze of the strange woman. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said sincerely 
                and with difficulty through the newly watered corridors of her 
                parched throat. &quot;Thank you for saving my life.&quot;</p>
              <p> XV</p>
              <p>The Sodomite pilgrims couldn't be described as great conversational 
                company. In fact, as they had all had their tongues removed, they 
                weren't able to converse at all. The conversation they had with 
                each other was conducted in sign language and mouthing, but this 
                was enough for them to organise themselves pretty well. Despite 
                their various mutilations, they were astonishingly self-sufficient 
                and capable. They knew exactly which roots, fruits and berries 
                could be safely eaten. They were expert at catching and killing 
                rabbits, birds and other animals to provide meat. Their various 
                cooking utensils were eminently practical for the task of living 
                off the land. They were, however, very kind and helpful to Sharon 
                and Sweetness. After the girls' abject failure in fending for 
                themselves in the Buggery countryside, the Sodomite pilgrims were 
                the perfect companions. <p>
                Nevertheless, association with the pilgrims came with a price, 
                but not, thankfully, one which involved self-mutilation: at least 
                not on the gross level that the Sodomite pilgrims had undergone. 
                All the pilgrims had had their tongues removed, and the third 
                finger of the left hand mostly removed or cut off. One girl had 
                her left hand cut off at the wrist, but the others had clearly 
                drawn the line at a less extreme point. The girls had their vaginas 
                sewn together, whilst the man had a bolt all the way through the 
                end of his penis, the other end of which was attached to his nipples. 
                All the pilgrims had their head shaved. Indeed, all their hair 
                except the eyebrows was removed: a daily ritual which the pilgrims 
                accompanied with prayers and even song, although as none of them 
                had tongues it was impossible to determine what these songs might 
                be about. <p>
                It was made clear to Sharon that although the girls were welcome 
                to accompany the Sodomite pilgrims on their wandering through 
                Buggery, they should at least conform to the same appearance as 
                their mentors. Both Sharon and Sweetness were far too disorientated 
                and distressed to object, after their ordeal in the camp and their 
                near starvation in the countryside. Indeed, Sharon was living 
                in a constant unfocused haze: a kind of continuing nightmare darkened 
                by her present fears and past traumas. Would she ever see Tracey 
                again? Would she ever see home again? Had she, in fact, already 
                died and was now in some kind of hell? She just allowed the Sodomites 
                to shave and decorate her as they so desired: not complaining 
                and really not caring.<p>
                Sweetness and she were both treated the same, so although she 
                had no mirror to see her reflection, she knew from looking at 
                Sweetness exactly what she now looked like. Her head, arms, vagina, 
                legs and armpits were all shaved by some lethal looking razor 
                blades which skimmed over the fairly basic creamy soap which was 
                applied to lubricate the skin and facilitate the shaving. This 
                ritual was almost pleasant. The girl whose face Sharon had first 
                glimpsed in some strange sense had adopted the pair, and she was 
                the one who administered the shave. As each part was shaved clean, 
                she then kissed the whole of the shaven area with her lips, as 
                if to be sure it was sufficiently smooth. Sharon might normally 
                have objected to this degree of intimacy, but she had seen that 
                the pilgrims adopted the exact same routine when shaving each 
                other. And it was undeniably quite pleasant to feel the brush 
                of this girl's nose and lips against the bare skin of her vagina. 
                The most intimate and unthreatening sensuality those lips had 
                probably ever experienced. At home, her labia was normally nothing 
                but an open door, or one, when not open, was pushed ajar with 
                as much haste as was required for a prick to get inside. Soon, 
                she and Sweetness lay back on the grass under the morning sun, 
                their skin fresh and clean after the application of the blade, 
                glistening in the shine of the soap and saliva that had accompanied 
                the shave. <p>
                Sharon ran her hand over her shaven head, and looked sadly at 
                the strands of her bleached hair where it lay on the grass. It 
                certainly felt weird. And from looking at Sweetness, she could 
                see how weird it also appeared. The pate was significantly paler 
                than the rest of the skin which had otherwise been mostly tanned 
                by the sun. Sharon was dismayed by how strangely nobbly Sweetness' 
                shaved head looked, and, of course, how it must be correspondingly 
                so on her own head. The bump at the nape of the neck where it 
                joined the skull. The ears looking so much smaller on a bare background. 
                The sweep of forehead which went up without interruption of any 
                kind at all. In fact, the loss of hair must have been more considerable 
                for Sweetness than for her. Sweetness' hair had previously been 
                quite long, often obscuring most of her face and much of her neck 
                and shoulders. Sharon's hair, by contrast, had not obscured very 
                much at all, and after the haircut administered by Primrose had 
                been relatively short already. But short was not at all the same 
                as bald. <p>
                The shave wasn't the last treatment meted out on the two girls 
                by the Sodomite pilgrims. Sharon's nipples were already pierced, 
                as was her clitoris. This was not true of Sweetness who had never 
                been pierced before, either voluntarily, like Sharon, or by law, 
                like most women in Buggery. The pilgrims found little difficulty 
                in threading chains and rings through Sharon's nipple and crotch. 
                She soon had weighty jangling ornamentation hanging from her front. 
                This seemed to represent some kind of clothing to the Sodomites, 
                although unlike any clothing Sharon had ever worn before, even 
                in Buggery, this provided neither warmth nor modesty. A wreath 
                of thin chains dangled from the rings through her nipples, and 
                were somehow held in check by those threaded through the ring 
                in her crotch<p>
                Applying the same ornamentation to Sweetness was more difficult. 
                Sharon had to explain to Sweetness what was happening to her as 
                the Sodomite pilgrims pierced her small puffy nipples and her 
                tender clitoris with their sharp pins. They were clearly skilled 
                at what they were doing, because although they didn't administer 
                any painkillers, the operation in the three points was done extremely 
                quickly and inflicted remarkably little pain on the young girl. 
                Her yelps of pain were tempered by the kisses administered to 
                her by the Sodomite girl who had taken responsibility for the 
                two. She rested Sweetness' head on her lap, and squeezed her hand 
                tightly and affectionately as she winced and cried out. And then 
                after all the piercing was done, she cuddled Sweetness to her 
                chest as the rings which had been inserted into her nipples and 
                clitoris kept the piercings open. And only after a quarter an 
                hour or more of such voiceless comforting were the chains threaded 
                through the rings, weighing her front down, and bringing her to 
                fresh cries of pain, as they tugged at her tender wounds. And, 
                there she stood, in front of Sharon who lay on the grass, gradually 
                getting used to her own new appearance: her head shaven, bare 
                legs and vagina, and a front obscured by chains. She stared ahead, 
                sightlessly and confused, unable perhaps to be sure whether she 
                alone had been singled out for this painful ceremony. Her eyes 
                were still moist from the tears she had shed during the piercing 
                ceremony, her breasts slightly bruised and even more puffy from 
                the weight of the chains, and the bruises and scratches she'd 
                gained after the two girls perambulations in the woods even more 
                distinct against her hairless bare frame lit by the unforgiving 
                glare of the Buggery morning sun. <p>
                Sharon looked at the Sodomite pilgrims gathered around them and 
                observed the indulgent smiles on their faces. She was suddenly 
                struck by a bolt of lucidity and was just as suddenly frightened. 
                She stood up and rushed over to Sweetness. She put an arm around 
                the blind girl, and pulled her bare body against her own.<p>
                &quot;You're not fucking cutting our tongues out! Or sewing our 
                fucking cunts together!&quot; She shouted at them.<p>
                The girl who'd comforted them smiled more broadly. She then made 
                some strange hand signals to her companions while mouthing something 
                while her voice made a sound her tongue couldn't articulate. The 
                other pilgrims laughed in a good-humoured way: a way which seemed 
                incongruous in such bizarre looking people. She then walked up 
                to Sharon, placed a forefinger to her lips, and placed her hand 
                on her crotch in a tender, non-threatening way.<p>
                &quot;Are you gonna fucking sew me up, you bastards?&quot; Sharon 
                asked aggressively.<p>
                The girl shook her shaved head with a frown and a smile. She then 
                pulled Sharon and Sweetness to her chest and kissed the two of 
                them affectionately. Her mouth moved, and her throat voiced a 
                response, but Sharon could make no sense of any of the guttural 
                vowels. She smiled again, and returned to her companions. She 
                immediately returned with a plate full of some more of the very 
                tasty vegetables that she had prepared earlier, and made another 
                growling sound which appeared to say &quot;Eat up!&quot;<p>
                The Sodomite pilgrims violated the two girls no further, and indeed 
                in their inarticulate way made their best efforts to make them 
                feel at ease. In fact, as Sharon came to realise, as they followed 
                the pilgrims through the countryside of Buggery, their newly shaved 
                heads and chains of Sodomite bondage were actually something to 
                be grateful for. None of the many police who they passed in their 
                wanderings paid them any attention at all. As a result of whatever 
                terms in which cross-border treaties had been phrased, the Sodomite 
                pilgrims were actually the most free people in the Kingdom of 
                Buggery. Indeed, the police appeared to be just as much disgusted 
                by the Sodomites' appearance as Sharon herself had been initially. 
                Even when the Sodomites prostrated themselves in front of the 
                police, arse to the air, gesturing invitingly at their anuses, 
                this provocation seemed to serve the purpose of actually dissuading 
                the police of doing anything. They left the Sodomites to their 
                own business, strutting off with their massive dildos strapped 
                to their waists, and protruding incongruously in front of them, 
                more willing to cause harm to their own citizens than to these 
                shaven, pierced and mutilated pilgrims. When they disappeared, 
                the pilgrims would smile amongst themselves, and kiss Sharon reassuringly, 
                aware of the terror that inevitably caused her body to tremble. 
                Sweetness as always knew only as much as Sharon ever told her, 
                which was normally just to keep quiet and pretend that her tongue 
                had also been torn out. <p>
                There was a comforting routine to the Sodomite's day. At sunrise, 
                sunset, and three other times a day, the pilgrims indulged in 
                a ritual which was both fascinating and quite unpleasant to watch. 
                Essentially, this involved anal intercourse: an exercise achieved 
                by the use of rather ornate dildos which the pilgrims drew out 
                of the cloth bags they carried over their shoulders. These bags 
                were themselves of some ritual significance: each of them was 
                embroidered with a slogan which must have had some meaning in 
                their faith. &quot;To Give is to Receive&quot;. &quot;Surrender 
                to the Will&quot;. &quot;The Orifice Taketh and Giveth Release&quot;. 
                This was clearly not a faith of silent contemplation. <p>
                Their ceremonies were an orgy of flesh and anal penetration: the 
                pilgrims' bodies entwined around each other, the dildos strapped 
                to the waists by leather and chains, their ends thrust deep inside 
                the ritually presented arses. Even the male pilgrim was made to 
                receive a dildo thrust up his arse. His own penis wasn't used 
                at all. The reason for this Sharon noticed with some distaste 
                was because he had been castrated, and the scrotum which seemed 
                so full beneath his flaccid penis was filled not with testicles 
                but with metal balls. Like the girls, he had to use a dildo to 
                fulfil his role in the ceremony.<p>
                While this went on, Sharon held onto Sweetness, glad that her 
                blindness precluded her from fully understanding what accompanied 
                the grunts and gasps which freely exploded from the pilgrims in 
                their orgiastic ceremony. The vaginas were sealed during the ceremony 
                as much then as at other times, which meant that the pissing on 
                each other that invariably conjoined the penetration was a messy 
                and uncoordinated affair, as the urine burst through the barrier 
                of stitches and rings, and splashed over the pilgrims in a random 
                kind of way. As also did the shit, which thankfully they didn't 
                always choose to ingest as part of the process. Some of the more 
                devout ensured that their ritual sodomy was also accompanied with 
                flagellation from nettles and whatever else could be used for 
                the purpose.<p>
