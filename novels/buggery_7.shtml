              <p>&quot;Fuck! They're only girls!&quot; snorted one of the soldiers 
                when the girls had approached near enough in the dusk for them 
                to be properly seen and for them to be within earshot.<p>
                &quot;But don't the fucking Buggery lot have fucking women soldiers?&quot; 
                another soldier said to his comrade. &quot;I vote we shoot the 
                fuckers to buggery, sir.&quot;<p>
                &quot;They're only girls, corporal&quot; repeated the first soldier. 
                &quot;Girls are no fucking good as soldiers. All they're good 
                for is fucking. Leave them. We got work to do.&quot;<p>
                Tracey and Buttercup were both pleased and a little surprised 
                to see the soldiers mostly ignore them, with only one of them 
                watching them with his gun half-cocked, while his comrades continued 
                loading items onto a jeep and busying themselves with some radio 
                equipment. They walked past the soldiers, still not convinced 
                that they weren't going to be shot, their arms dropped to their 
                side from weariness and perspiring heavily despite the cooling 
                evening air.<p>
                They saw what looked like a border guard, who was standing to 
                attention by a chair, his machine-gun by his side, eyeing them 
                suspiciously as they approached. His expression was quite clearly 
                not of the friendliest. Just behind him, on the Gomorran side 
                was another soldier who was smoking a cigarette and staring as 
                much at them as at his comrade.<p>
                Buttercup walked up to the guard, who was built quite large with 
                very short hair and a small dark moustache underneath a brutal 
                looking nose. He turned his dark eyes towards Buttercup. &quot;What 
                the fuck do you want?&quot; he asked, raising his machine gun 
                directly at her<p>
                Tracey walked behind Buttercup, disloyally wondering how much 
                Buttercup's body might shield her from a hail of bullets. Buttercup 
                smiled, despite her obvious terror. &quot;We're refugees, sir. 
                We want to escape from the horrors of Buggery to the famous refuge 
                of Gomorrah.&quot;<p>
                The guard lowered his gun, and laughed in a not especially amiable 
                way. &quot;Refugees! Fuck! For Gomorrah! You're not the first 
                bitches to want to enter our democratic republic, but the last 
                ones we dispatched pretty quickly. Fucking whores! Why should 
                we fucking spare you? Is it 'cause you got through the fucking 
                mine-field. If you weren't fucking tarts, you ought to get fucking 
                medals for getting here without your fucking leg blown off!&quot;<p>
                Tracey blanched. Mine-field? In her fear and desperation, she'd 
                totally forgotten that it wasn't just bullets she'd had to be 
                mindful of. What fucking slim chance had she had that she'd survived 
                this walk?<p>
                Buttercup, however, continued smiling and continued walking towards 
                the soldier. &quot;We can make it worth your while,&quot; she 
                said seductively.<p>
                &quot;I bet you fucking can, whore!&quot; snorted the guard. &quot;But 
                you're not a bad looking bitch. I could let you through. But what 
                about your scrawny bitch girlfriend. What say we that we blow 
                her to fuck and just let you through.&quot;<p>
                &quot;It's either both of us or neither of us,&quot; Buttercup 
                said firmly.<p>
                &quot;In that case,&quot; snarled the guard as if challenged, 
                raising his gun and holding it up as if ready to let loose. And 
                then with a bit of a snarl. &quot;Yeah! S'pose we could do with 
                a bit of a fuck. Oi! Jello! What d'you think?&quot;<p>
                His comrade threw the stub of his cigarette onto the ground, and 
                stubbed it out with a booted foot. &quot;Yeah, Buzzcock. I ain't 
                had a fuck for days. And the long haired cow is a real motherfucking 
                killer bitch.&quot;<p>
                &quot;OK, Girls!&quot; grunted Buzzcock. &quot;You're in luck. 
                Come on the Gomorran side of the border.&quot; He stood to one 
                side as Buttercup and Tracey strode to the gap in the wire fence, 
                and walked through, a sudden spasm of relief exploding inside 
                Tracey's chest. They weren't going to be killed! &quot;Welcome 
                to fucking democracy. There's no fucking royalty here. And there's 
                none of your fucking Buggery perversions neither.&quot;<p>
                Jello stopped Buttercup when Tracey was through the gap. &quot;Now, 
                you bitch! It's fucking payback time. Let's see what you've got 
                to offer.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Not so fast, sonny Jim!&quot; growled Buzzcock. &quot;We 
                can't let them in like this! Not with the scrawny cunt fucking 
                dressed up like some half-arsed nancy boy. You fuckers take your 
                fucking rings out of your cunts, or we'll fucking pull them out. 
                And you, chicken shit!&quot; he addressed Tracey. &quot;You take 
                off that fucking shirt or whatever you call it on your fucking 
                tits. There ain't no clothes allowed for bitches here. Bitches 
                don't have the fucking right. I don't know what your fucking cunt-arse 
                government lets you fuckers get away with: but bitches have got 
                to know their place here. And give me your fucking bag and all!&quot;<p>
                &quot;But my passport! My money!&quot;<p>
                &quot;You won't need fucking Buggery dinars in Gomorrah. Their 
                fucking useless. In case you hadn't noticed we're at war with 
                you lot. But your passport's worth more than both your lives put 
                together.&quot; Buzzcock grabbed the bag, turned it upside down 
                and poured its contents on the floor. A cascade of lipstick, compacts, 
                notes and knickknacks fell to the floor, including Tracey's precious 
                passport. &quot;Fuck me! Real money! And a real passport! What 
                kind of fucking whore are you to have this kind of stuff on you? 
                Did you steal it?&quot;<p>
                &quot;No!&quot; Tracey replied indignantly despite her distress. 
                &quot;It's mine. I took hours queuing up at the passport office 
                for it!&quot;<p>
                Buzzcock grunted. &quot;So you're a fucking foreigner even to 
                Buggery. Well, don't expect any help here. Bitches like you won't 
                be allowed within even a mile of a fucking consulate.&quot;<p>
                Tracey and Buttercup stood together: Tracey feeling more naked 
                than she'd ever felt before with no clothes, no possessions and 
                not even the cunt-ring which despite herself she'd got rather 
                attached to. And what were the soldiers going to do?<p>
                Her answer came fairly soon, and in full sight of the other soldiers 
                loading the vehicles. She and Buttercup were dragged onto the 
                ground by their hair, her roots stinging from the rough tugging, 
                and then the two of them were brutally raped. At least, she assumed 
                it was rape, even though Buttercup had, in a very real and genuine 
                sense, asked for it. But this wasn't making love. It wasn't even 
                like the rough sex she'd sometimes had on a bad date. Or like 
                the drunken fucking she'd had when she'd told the bloke she was 
                with to fuck off. This was brutal, violent and animal. They were 
                forcibly penetrated with no preparation at all. First Buzzcock 
                into Buttercup and then Jello into her. She was so dry down there. 
                And it hurt. And she was punched when she struggled. And then 
                it was more cock in her cunt. And cock in her arse. And then a 
                slap round the face. And after more minutes of unpleasant, disgusting 
                forced penetration, sperm squirted into her mouth and eyes.<p>
                And then it was over. The soldiers had had enough. They buttoned 
                up their trousers, which they had only lowered to their knees 
                in all the time. &quot;Now fuck off!&quot; commanded Buzzcock. 
                <p>
                Tracey and Buttercup picked up their bruised bodies. Tracey left 
                with a small trickle of blood down her thighs that had been drawn 
                from her anus, and a fresh bruise upswelling on her chin. Buttercup 
                had sustained a cut lip and one eye was strangely swollen as a 
                bruise began to form. Her hair was disordered and she seemed even 
                more shocked than Tracey. It occurred to her through her own misery 
                that Buttercup, being the so much more attractive of the two girls, 
                had almost certainly received more attention than she. And that 
                somehow the more attractive a girl was, the more determined the 
                soldiers had been that she should suffer.<p>
                Tracey put an arm around Buttercup who was weeping and occasionally 
                coughing, small traces of blood spitting out onto her cheek. They 
                turned around and walked along the road. They hadn't walk any 
                distance however, when Jello jumped in front of them with a snarl. 
                <p>
                &quot;Fuck! Don't you fucking Buggery bitches know fucking anything! 
                This is a fucking road. Yeah! A fucking road! And so it's not 
                for the likes of you fucking whores. If you don't want us to fucking 
                shoot you, stay off the fucking road. In case you ignorant cows 
                didn't know, roads are for fucking men only. You bitches stay 
                off the road, if you know what's good for you.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Where do we go?&quot; sobbed Buttercup, strangely subdued.<p>
                &quot;I don't fucking know! You wanted to come to Gomorrah, didn't 
                you. We didn't have to let you through. Anywhere. As long as it's 
                not on a fucking road. Or a fucking town. Or a fucking city. You 
                bitches ain't got no rights.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Sorry?&quot; asked Tracey, sure that she'd misunderstood 
                something.<p>
                &quot;You don't know fuck shit! Let me spell it out for you. You're 
                in the Democratic Fucking Republic of Fucking Gomorrah! You're 
                fucking bitches! That means you've got no fucking constitutional 
                rights. No fucking consti-fucking-tutional rights at all! No fucking 
                women, bitches, whores, girls or dykes have rights. Not to clothes. 
                Not to possessions. Not to fucking anything. Keep your nose clean 
                and keep out of men only areas!&quot;
              <p> XII</p>
              <p>Sharon's recollection of her rape and that of Sweetness by the 
                Buggery soldiers was confused and painful. She had never known 
                that sex could be so horrible, and she was sure she'd known horrible 
                sex before. Even non-consensual, when the bloke in the car park 
                who she'd been avoiding all night had fucked her in that brutal 
                way. But that was almost fun compared to the horrors of the brutal 
                and seemingly never-ending rape she'd endured on the Buggery battlefield. 
                She knew that her arse and cunt were being violated repeatedly, 
                but it was only pain and humiliation and fear that she was fully 
                aware of. Surely by now they'd had enough, she'd thought as once 
                again her dry and unwilling cunt was penetrated by which prick 
                she didn't know. She could see through the tears that clouded 
                her eyes and the blackness that threatened her consciousness, 
                that Sweetness was being treated no less brutally than herself. 
                How could sex be so bad? She'd always associated it with pleasure, 
                and now all she could do was hope and pray that it would be over 
                soon. But no chance! Yet another of those peculiarly permanently 
                stiff penises pushed through the bruised and ripped lips of her 
                cunt and pushed into her far deeper than she was properly able 
                to take it. And the violence wasn't just restricted to just her 
                arse and cunt. She was forcibly held down and her arms stung from 
                the force of the soldier's grip while she her mouth and nose burrowed 
                into the dry earth. Every time she stirred in any way that could 
                be interpreted as resistance, and resisting was what she couldn't 
                help doing, she was punched or kicked.<p>
                She barely registered the world around her. Was it day or was 
                it night? Sweetness was screaming in misery and distress. &quot;Joy! 
                Joy!&quot; she gasped as another man's khaki-coloured buttocks 
                fell on top of her and thrust brutally in and out of her. It was 
                with an extra degree of disgust that she noticed that the soldier's 
                sexual attentions were not limited to the two girls. They would 
                grasp each other's balls, suck each other's dicks, and she was 
                sure she saw two soldiers fucking each other. In fact, she was 
                fucking certain, as one soldier's buttocks descended onto the 
                buttocks of the soldier fucking Sweetness, pushing his prick in 
                with far less resistance than he'd have found in Sharon's cunt 
                and pushed backwards and forwards in a manic fashion gasping orgasmically 
                in the same rhythm as Sweetness' cries of pain.<p>
                And then, she didn't recall how, they were dragged along, their 
                knees bleeding from when they staggered and fell, just as did 
                their orifices from their punishment, away from the smoking ruins 
                of the bombed factory for how long Sharon didn't know. But each 
                step was an agony. Each stumble, and its attendant kicks and blows 
                from the soldiers, another even greater agony. She could barely 
                see where they were: the tears in her eyes clouded everything 
                despite the bright sun. She repeated Tracey's name again and again 
                without knowing why, punctuated by every fucking shitting bastard 
                swear word in her vocabulary. Loud enough she was sure to be heard 
                by anyone with an ear to her cut lip, but not to the soldiers. 
                Occasionally, a drop of blood, from her nose or from her cheek, 
                she didn't know, would trail into her mouth and cause her to cough 
                despite the pain this gave to her bruised ribs.<p>
                And then, at last, no more walking. Sweetness and she were in 
                a dark tent where only the patches of sun through the black tarpaulin 
                allowed sufficient illumination for her to see where she was. 
                She collapsed from pain and exhaustion, pleased only that the 
                worst agonies were over; and then the darkness that had bubbled 
                in the recesses of her mind overwhelmed her and that was the last 
                she could remember.<p>
                When she awoke, she didn't know when, she was able to examine 
                the tent where they had been left. There was very little to it. 
                There were some wooden boxes and crates, and the bare uneven ground 
                on which the tent had been erected. Behind her was a metal post 
                pushed into the ground, and from that came a metal chain which 
                was attached to her left ankle and restricted her to less than 
                a yard in which she could crawl, and was not long enough to permit 
                her to stand. She wasn't alone in the tent. She could see the 
                shadowy figure of Sweetness, similarly chained to a metal post, 
                just outside her reach, and she could hear an incoherent sobbing.<p>
                Not wholly incoherent. Occasionally, Sharon could distinguish 
                the name 'Joy', but otherwise there was nothing that made sense. 
                Despite her own pain and misery, Sharon felt an overwhelming emotion 
                of pity for the girl. Being blind, her shock and horror must have 
                been compounded by her helplessness and by her ignorance as to 
                exactly what horrors had been meted on her. Sweetness raised her 
                face and looked in her direction, her eyes registering nothing, 
                a black bruise swelling on her right cheek and eyes, and dried 
                blood and snot on her upper lip. &quot;Joy! Joy! Where are you?&quot; 
                she moaned, and then buried her face into the palms of her hands.<p>
                Here they were, somewhere. Alive at least. With nothing. This 
                hadn't worried Sharon before. Her very life had been her chief 
                concern. But now she was sure. Her blouse was removed, thrown 
                aside no doubt in the rape. Her sandals that she'd bought in the 
                high street when she and Tracey were happily planning the holiday: 
                gone forever, trampled into the dusty fields outside. And her 
                bag, with her passport, money and possessions, gone also. Never 
                to be seen again. Along with her last hopes of ever leaving Buggery 
                by the normal process of border control. Would she ever see home 
                again? Would she even survive to see the world beyond the tent? 
                What would become of her?<p>
                Or of Sweetness? Did she even know that Joy had been blown to 
                pieces? Or that the factory where she'd lived was now nothing 
                but rubble and smoke? She gazed at the young girl sadly. So thin. 
                So helpless. And she must have led such a sad life. Fucking for 
                a living. And a living that had been a dank hole in the ground, 
                in a Kingdom where her very blindness was as good as a death sentence. 
                Whose situation was worse? Sharon who'd had at least some good 
                times in the smoky night-clubs and damp car parks of home? And 
                even had the best fucks of her life not so many days ago? Or Sweetness 
                who'd known nothing but misery and despair ever since her sightless 
                emergence into the world? Strangely, contemplating Sweetness' 
                dire straits made her own seem the more bearable and in a curious 
                way a source of some guilty comfort.<p>
                Sharon pulled her naked bruised body over the earth and leaned 
                out a hand in Sweetness' direction. She couldn't quite reach the 
                girl, but Sweetness heard her movements. Her face lit up and her 
                sightless eyes looked in her direction with a disconcerting vacuousness. 
                &quot;Joy! Is that you?&quot; she gasped.<p>
                &quot;It's me. Sharon.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Sharon? The tourist. Where's Joy?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Joy's dead. There's no more Joy.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Dead. No Joy!&quot; Sweetness weeped, but she'd clearly 
                already half-reconciled herself to this possibility, not erupting 
                into the hysteria of tears that Sharon had feared. &quot;How did 
                she die? What happened? Where am I?&quot;<p>
                Sharon explained to Sweetness as best she could what had happened 
                and where they were. And rehearsed as much to herself as for Sweetness' 
                benefit the horrors they had been through. She talked and she 
                talked, disjointedly, ramblingly, punctuated with questions of 
                how Sweetness was, less from a need to know and more from a need 
                to hear Sweetness reply through the globules of tears, mucus and 
                blood in her mouth. Every now and then, Sweetness would interject 
                with &quot;Joy. Joy's dead. She's dead.&quot; She was evidently 
                trying to comprehend the enormity of her situation.<p>
                The flaps of the tent briefly parted, letting in a flood of daylight, 
                and the tall slim figure of a young man entered. He seemed peculiarly 
                delicate and somehow awkward. He was clearly a soldier, and like 
                the soldiers who'd raped the two girls he was naked and his entire 
                skin was dyed khaki. He differed only in that he carried a holster 
                around his left shoulder and had several stripes tattooed onto 
                his right shoulder. He was also had a normal flaccid penis. He 
                walked over to the girls and crouched in front of them.<p>
                &quot;I'm Sergeant Moss. I'm the commander of this camp since 
                the colonel was killed yesterday. How are you? Not feeling too 
                bad I hope?&quot;<p>
                Sharon stared at him, barely able to hide the hostility from her 
                gaze. &quot;What do you fucking think? I feel fucking awful. And 
                when are you gonna let us go, you bastard?&quot;<p>
                The young man sighed. &quot;I'm afraid that's not possible. You're 
                spoils of war, I'm afraid. Escape is just not possible. The soldiers 
                need some R&amp;R, you know. And you're unfortunate enough to 
                have to provide it for them. I'm deeply sorry for you. It wasn't 
                my choice. But war is war. And you are victims of it.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You fucking shit! Fucking let us free. I don't fucking care 
                about what your fucking soldiers want. And anyway haven't they 
                fucking done enough?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I can't apologise enough for the violence and brutality 
                of my men. What they did to you was inexcusable. Rape is one of 
                the worst crimes there is. Short of murder, of course. But this 
                is war. We've sustained a colossal amount of injury in the last 
                day. The colonel's gamble just didn't pay off. The Gomorrans gave 
                us far more of a drubbing than we'd expected. At least a thousand 
                men died yesterday and last night, and most of our supplies were 
                destroyed by the bombing raids. But I don't expect you to sympathise 
                with my men. All I can offer as comfort is the observation that 
                at least my men didn't kill you.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Didn't what they do to us &#133; wasn't that fucking enough?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Rape is normal in war. My men haven't had sex with a woman 
                for years. Many of them have never fucked a woman before. But 
                like it or not my men probably saved your lives. The Gomorran 
                soldiers are not known for their mercy. They would also have raped 
                you - just as they would have raped any of my soldiers - but it's 
                unlikely they'd have let you live. And you were in the heart of 
                a battle field. Gunfire, mines, bombs. Your chances of survival 
                were very low. I doubt whether very many others in that settlement 
                of yours managed to wake up this morning&#133;&quot;<p>
                &quot;Tracey&#133;&quot; mused Sharon. Her best friend was probably 
                also dead. And all they'd wanted was a holiday in the sun. Her 
                eyes exploded in tears. &quot;You bastards! You bastards! You 
                fucking fucking bastards!&quot;<p>
                &quot;I can see you're unhappy,&quot; mused the sergeant. &quot;And 
                I can't promise you the security or the freedom you want. And 
                we don't have any medical supplies to do anything about your cuts 
                and bruises. But they do look superficial, so I don't think you're 
                likely to die from them. Much as I'd like to, I can't free you. 
                It would be my death sentence. Morale is low enough as it is, 
                and any small thing I can do to assist my men is about all there 
                is left for me to do until, or if, reinforcements ever arrive. 
                I'll leave you now. But I'm sorry to have to inform you that, 
                from now on, you will be expected to provide sexual favours for 
                my men, and that some of them are not going to be that gentle 
                with you. But I can promise you that I will do my best to ameliorate 
                the agony. It won't be much, but I do have a modicum of authority 
                even if I don't believe I have quite the respect my rank should 
                have.&quot;<p>
                With that, he left the two girls huddled on the dry ground, once 
                again to immerse themselves in their misery. Eventually, Sharon 
                managed to fall asleep again, her consciousness sinking in clouds 
                of despair and Sweetness' muttered moans and cries as she mourned 
                the death of her companion. &quot;No Joy!&quot; she moaned again 
                and again. &quot;No more Joy. No more Joy again. Ever!&quot;<p>
                The sergeant soon became the most frequent visitor to the tent 
                as the days and nights merged into a hazy horror of misery, discomfort 
                and despair. After a while, Sharon almost looked forward to the 
                visits as they were the only thing which interrupted the tedium 
                and bleakness which did not necessarily involve sexual penetration. 
                When he wasn't there, which was most of the time, Sharon and Sweetness 
                lay near each other slumped on the hard dusty earth. The only 
                physical comfort Sharon could give Sweetness was to hold her hand 
                as they stretched out towards each other, while Sweetness rambled 
                on about her worries and woes. Generally, their conversations 
                were disjointed, and returned repeatedly to their worries about 
                their current situation and their recent losses. Sweetness was 
                genuinely inconsolable about the death of Joy who had been her 
                protector, keeper and lover for two or more years. Her life before 
                that had been even less pleasant than living in the ruined factory. 
                She had been kept in hiding from the police from birth by sympathetic 
                peasants. The war reached where they lived, and in the chaos of 
                the destruction which befell the village and her guardians, Sweetness 
                found herself helpless and alone in the world, not knowing where 
                she was and where to go. It was Joy who'd found her and saved 
                her life, but she would forever blame herself that she'd not been 
                able in some way to prevent Joy from losing her life. Her sightless 
                eyes were red and raw from the tears which memories of her darling 
                Joy inevitably provoked in her.<p>
                When the flaps of the tent opened and the sergeant returned, Sharon 
                was always filled with dread if he came in with anyone else. And 
                usually there were three or four others. Because this invariably 
                meant more rest and recreation for the soldiers who accompanied 
                him and several hours of pain and humiliation for the two girls. 
                With little introduction and sooner than Sharon ever feared, she 
                and Sweetness would be fucked: in the arse and in the cunt, and 
                no opportunity to protest. After her initial rape, Sharon vowed 
                she'd never be penetrated again, but what use were her vows where 
                she was: tethered to a pole and thoroughly incapable of putting 
                up any struggle at all if she didn't want a gun butt slammed into 
                her face. <p>
                The soldiers who raped her, - and it couldn't really be called 
                anything else, - were mostly quite young, were frighteningly unimaginative 
                and insensitive in their love-making, and invariably left her 
                lower regions battered, bruised and torn. They all were blessed 
                with the phenomenal erections which seemed to be a permanent feature 
                of them. The only times Sharon ever saw a penis that wasn't red 
                and raw with a throbbing glans and veins was after the soldiers 
                had at long last relieved their sperm either into or onto them. 
                The sergeant was the only one privileged to have a penis that 
                wasn't mostly erect. <p>
                The fucking was intense, amateurish, and seemed to go on forever. 
                And she wasn't fucked nearly as much as Sweetness who, because 
                of her youth and vitality, was more thoroughly fucked than she 
                was. She was becoming accustomed to pricks up her arse, shoved 
                into her mouth and plunged (least painfully of all) up her cunt. 
                And at the same time, she could see Sweetness through her tears 
                of rage and disgust engulfed by a mob of khaki-coloured figures 
                who were fucking her as best they could. When they weren't fucking 
                each other. Which they did frequently, during, before and after 
                fucking either or both of the girls. <p>
                The sergeant, despite his protestations of decency, was no less 
                of a fucker than the others. His long thin prick, when aroused, 
                as it very soon was, joined the others in painful penetrating 
                her, Sweetness and of course the arse of all, or many, of the 
                other soldiers. And when they left, Sharon and Sweetness would 
                be nursing their fresh wounds and humiliations slumped on a ground 
                which never got more comfortable and dampened by semen, shit and 
                piss. Even this respite which they'd been hoping and praying for 
                all the time they'd been raped, offered little comfort and even 
                less hope. And as the small pile of their shit and piss grew in 
                the shadow of the tent, it really did not smell very reassuring 
                either.<p>
                However, when the sergeant entered unaccompanied there was no 
                question of sex and he was all kindness. Even if Sharon remembered 
                distinctly the times he'd fucked her (and no more expertly or 
                sensitively than his soldiers), these were visits which she rather 
                welcomed and which offered Sweetness and she almost the only respite 
                from their misery.<p>
                He explained that he'd never wanted to be a soldier. In fact, 
                his ambition had always to be a poet, a talent for which he had 
                shown great promise whilst at school. But the Kingdom of Buggery 
                had no demand for poets and a much greater appetite for cannon 
                fodder. Despite his delight and skill at verse, he'd also proven 
                himself to be a brave and capable soldier for which he earned 
                his promotion to sergeant. For this he earned more stripes, the 
                tattooing of which was almost as painful as his initial tattoo 
                into military colours. This was mandatory for all soldiers, and 
                ensured that they would have no chance of any other career for 
                the rest of their generally rather short lives.<p>
                He was very lucky to have survived the battle which had killed 
                Joy and separated Sharon from Tracey. The carnage had been indiscriminate 
                and widespread. At least fifty, and maybe a hundred, soldiers 
                had actually been machine-gunned down by forces of the Buggery 
                Army who were under instructions to fire on any retreating soldiers. 
                The press of soldiers attempting to escape the bloodshed behind 
                them into the guns of the army's rear guard would have been greater 
                if the Gomorran jet planes hadn't been so thorough in their carpet 
                bombing of the Buggery army encampment. Had the Gomorrans been 
                less efficient, it was unlikely that the sergeant would still 
                be alive.<p>
                Buggery military life was harsh and unremitting, and, true to 
                the general policies of the Kingdom, as humiliating and brutal 
                for the soldiers as it was for the citizenry they were defending. 
                Once in military tattoos, clothes were banned, and as a result 
                of injections, pills and masturbation (sometimes mutual), soldiers 
                were expected to maintain an erection at most times. Particularly 
                during battle and inspections. The thinking was that a sexually 
                aroused soldier was necessarily an effective one. The sergeant 
                was uncertain as to the truth of this, but he knew that his own 
                prick was at its greatest state of arousal during combat. Slaying, 
                fucking, being fucked: all were part of the excitement of war. 
                And he could vouch that it certainly scared the fuck out of the 
                Gomorrans to be faced by massed erections, occasionally squirting 
                out semen as they made the kill.<p>
                Women were rarely pressed into military service, and those few 
                rarely survived very days, even if they were never caught up in 
                combat. However, sex was such an integral part of life in Buggery 
                that soldiers were expected to have sex with each other. Anal 
                intercourse was encouraged and even enforced. However, rank had 
                to be respected. Higher ranks could fuck anyone of lower rank: 
                and did so with appetite and arbitrariness. Lower ranks could 
                only fuck those of the same rank as themselves or lower. A colonel 
                could fuck a corporal, but a corporal could never stick his prick 
                up a colonel's anus however much he wanted to (or the colonel 
                might actually like it). Life in the army was a man's life, but 
                not a life for a man who was choosy about his sexual partners.<p>
                When the sergeant left, Sweetness and Sharon would be left alone 
                in the shadows of the tent: sometimes left very much in the dark 
                when it was nightfall. Although Sharon insisted to Sweetness that 
                she was no fucking dyke, (something which she wasn't sure Sweetness 
                really understood), she sought out Sweetness' hand to clasp and 
                didn't complain too much as she stroked her ankle or arm or whatever 
                little of her that she could reach. Besides, Sweetness was still 
                grieving the loss of Joy. It was difficult for Sharon to understand 
                how a girl like her, who might even be quite attractive had she 
                the chance of gaining weight on her emaciated body, could ever 
                find much pleasure in the crippled disfigured body of her deceased 
                lover. Sometimes Sharon's mind cast back to the days before she 
                and Tracey arrived in Buggery. Squalid though their life had been, 
                it was paradise compared to her the dilemma of her current confinement.</p>
              <p><p>
                XIII</p>
              <p>Tracey and Buttercup wandered along in the dark Gomorran landscape, 
                their shadows cast forward by the light of the nearly full moon, 
                able to see that on this side of the border as on the other there 
                was evidence of the detritus of war. They were both very tired 
                and both felt thoroughly abused. Buttercup was finding the pain 
                between her legs a particular agony for which she was grateful 
                for Tracey's devoted love, as she grasped her lover's hand. Tracey 
                herself tried to keep out of her mind both her feeling of relief 
                that she hadn't been blown to pieces by mines on the Buggery side 
                of the border and her apprehension that it might still happen 
                on the Gomorran side. She didn't know what she'd expected on arrival 
                in Gomorrah, but she knew it hadn't been yet more of this anxious 
                loneliness and fear, and this feeling that she had left one hell 
                only to arrive in another which so far promised no better than 
                that which they'd left. The pain in her own vagina and arse, though 
                less than that of the more absolutely abused Buttercup, still 
                made her feel weak and helpless. <p>
                Eventually, after several hours of directionless wandering away 
                from the border, the two girls had to succumb to their exhaustion. 
                They moved out of the open air, where at least they could see 
                where they were, into the forbidding shadows of a copse, where 
                a crater and the remains of a fire-bombed jeep reminded them that 
                war was still not that far behind them. They rested together, 
                relying on each other for warmth and comfort, each being a pillow 
                for the other's weary head, too exhausted for Tracey to make love 
                to Buttercup: an ambition which had so often surfaced in her thoughts 
                as she admired her lover. And soon they were asleep, too exhausted 
                to care anymore. Occasionally, Tracey thought of Sharon. Was her 
                friend even alive? She wondered. Or had she been brutally raped 
                and murdered by the Gomorran soldiers as she'd witnessed them 
                treat the Buggery soldier?<p>
                Tracey was awoken by Buttercup, who was gently stroking her hair. 
                She lifted herself up on her elbow and looked around her in the 
                bright sunlight at the desolate, parched countryside, initially 
                convinced that she was still in Buggery, and that her memories 
                of the day before had been nothing but an unpleasant nightmare. 
                Buttercup kissed her sadly, but lovingly. Despite her anxiety, 
                Tracey smiled. &quot;At least we're still alive.&quot;<p>
                Buttercup returned the smile, on a face whose beauty was badly 
                marred by a growing bruise on her cheek and a cut just above her 
                eye. She glanced down at her crotch, where Tracey could see a 
                small trickle of blood that had emerged from her vagina. &quot;Not 
                just alive,&quot; Buttercup said with a sadness,. &quot;but together!&quot; 
                <p>
                She sat up, and grasped her knees between her arms, slightly shuddering 
                from a despair that Tracey recognised in herself. &quot;Now, we've 
                got to make a new life together in Gomorrah. And first we've got 
                to find some other people. And just hope that they aren't as brutal 
                as the border guards.&quot;<p>
                Despite their weariness and hunger, the two girls lifted themselves 
                up, and walked out into the open. Behind them they could see the 
                line of the border defences and, beyond, the battered landscape 
                of Buggery. Ahead was just more desolate, broken ground, broken 
                by the odd copse and decaying tree, and no evidence of human settlement. 
                But they walked on, their feet aching on the harsh uneven ground, 
                their skin burning in the morning heat, and their hands clasped 
                desperately together.<p>
                It was only after several hours of wandering, broken occasionally 
                by rests on the odd boulder, where Tracey felt acutely her lack 
                of cigarettes, that they came to anything that resembled habitation. 
                And a sorry squalid landscape it was too. A kind of shanty town 
                of tents and buildings of cardboard and corrugated iron. And amongst 
                it they could see the odd figure wandering naked amongst the buildings. 
                As they got closer, they realised that all the figures they could 
                see were women, all of them naked and all looking a little scruffy 
                even in their nudity.<p>
                Buttercup bravely approached one woman, letting go of Tracey's 
                hand, who reluctantly relinquished her grip. The woman had long 
                poorly combed hair to her waist, a very hairy vagina which stood 
                out as a broad triangle of fur between her legs, and had shaved 
                neither her legs nor under her arms. She made the two girls seem 
                peculiarly even more naked than she, with the short stubble of 
                hair on their own vaginas, and the slowly growing hair on the 
                rest of their body.<p>
                &quot;Greetings,&quot; said Buttercup. &quot;We're refugees from 
                Buggery. We're looking for somewhere to live.&quot;<p>
                The woman looked at them without surprise, and not especially 
                welcomingly. &quot;I guessed as much. You're not the first refugees 
                to come this way. And I guess you've also been made suitably welcome 
                by the border guards.&quot; She brushed her nose with the back 
                of her hand, leaving a small smudge on her nose. &quot;Heaven 
                knows why you should come here. To Gomorrah. There are women from 
                Gomorrah who are so desperate to leave, that they become refugees 
                in Buggery. But at least you're alive. And you've still got all 
                your limbs, I see. You don't know how lucky you are. Many refugees 
                who come here, came off much worse for wear than you have.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Can you help us? Do you know anyone who can give us food 
                and shelter?&quot; persisted Buttercup, despite this rather unencouraging 
                introduction.<p>
                &quot;Yeah. Sure. I know how to help. But don't think I can help 
                that much! I don't know what you foreigners expected, but you're 
                not gonna find much luxury here.&quot;<p>
                She led them through a maze of tightly packed huts and make-shift 
                dwellings to a rather larger wooden shack near the centre of the 
                settlement. They walked past small dogs, innumerable chickens 
                and several cows and goats; along paths worn down by feet; past 
                other women similarly naked and unshaven. This was a village in 
                desperate need of a hairdresser, Tracey reflected. She was also 
                aware that there were no shops or even market stalls. What sort 
                of dump was this? The woman left the two girls outside the shack 
                while she went in. &quot;I won't be long,&quot; she promised.<p>
                A few minutes later she emerged with another woman who was probably 
                in her early forties, and who, like all the other women they'd 
                seen, was naked, hairy and unkempt. She had a proud bush of hair 
                obscuring her crotch which crept onto her thighs and half the 
                way to her navel. Her dark brown hair was long and bushy, and 
                showed no evidence of having seen a brush or comb. She smiled 
                at the two girls with rather more warmth than the woman they'd 
                first met.<p>
                &quot;Hello. Glad to meet you. I'm Delta Seven Oh Nine Three, 
                but you can call me Delta. I've been elected Welfare Officer for 
                our village. I guess you're refugees here. Come inside out of 
                the sun. Please.&quot;<p>
                Buttercup and Tracey followed Delta, lowering their heads as they 
                passed through the rather low door. The room inside was very sparsely 
                decorated, with just a wooden frame bed and a few cushions scattered 
                about on the floor. Delta sat on the edge of the bed and signalled 
                to the girls that they should recline on the cushions.<p>
                &quot;So?&quot; Asked Delta after the formalities of introduction 
                were over. &quot;What brings you to Gomorrah?&quot;<p>
                Delta did not appear at all surprised at Buttercup's account of 
                why she had escaped from Buggery, but was quite startled when 
                she discovered that Tracey had been a tourist. She needed a little 
                explanation as to what a tourist was. It was clearly neither a 
                word nor a concept familiar to her. <p>
                &quot;So people from your country regularly travel to other countries 
                and then leave after only a week or two. And you visit places 
                like Buggery. I don't think we have any 'tourists' in Gomorrah. 
                In fact, we don't have many visitors at all. Gomorrah's a kind 
                of international pariah. I don't believe it has very many foreign 
                friends at all.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Why's that? Is it a horrible regime like Buggery?&quot; 
                wondered Tracey.<p>
                &quot;Well, in fact it's a democracy. And quite a free democracy. 
                But women aren't allowed to vote, and whichever government comes 
                in seems to compete with each other to maintain the state of sexual 
                apartheid which distinguishes this country.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Sexual apartheid?&quot; queried Tracey who'd never heard 
                of the word before. &quot;What's that mean? Is it some kind of 
                kinky perversion?&quot;<p>
                Delta frowned. &quot;You seriously don't know what it means? But 
                that's why no one in the world recognises the Gomorran Republic. 
                It's when women don't have any rights, and men have all the rights 
                they care to elect for themselves.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Rights?&quot; wondered Buttercup who was having quite different 
                difficulties in understanding what Delta was going on about.<p>
                &quot;You know: the right to own property; the right to vote in 
                state or local elections; the right to education; the right to 
                roam freely without help or hindrance; the right to travel on 
                men only public transport or to enter men only zones; the right 
                to bear and bring up your own children; the right to protection 
                by the law from abuse and harassment; the right to be treated 
                the same as a man.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You mean you have to rights for all that?&quot; wondered 
                Tracey whose knowledge of politics was limited to knowing who 
                the prime minister was, and even then she wasn't always sure. 
                &quot;I thought that was just natural.&quot;<p>
                &quot;It obviously is where you come from. And it's because women 
                in Gomorrah don't have rights that all the other governments in 
                the world won't ever talk to the Gomorran government or even recognise 
                its right to exist. We don't have the rights to possess anything: 
                not clothes, not land, not anything. They just about tolerate 
                us living in villages like this, because otherwise all the women 
                would die from exposure and starvation. And then the men wouldn't 
                be able to have sex, bear children or have cheap labour. And even 
                then there are some who'd begrudge us even this much.&quot;<p>
                &quot;So, how do you live?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well. We can live off the common land, which is all the 
                crap land that the men don't want. We can sell our bodies. And 
                we can work in the factories and as servants doing all the chores 
                which men think are beneath them. But we have to be careful where 
                we go and what we say. And we mustn't ever complain. That's about 
                it. Anything else we do is strictly speaking illegal.&quot;<p>
                &quot;What sort of things are they?&quot;<p>
                &quot;There are unofficial schools which we've set up to educate 
                the girls as soon as they're dumped on us. Which is from birth, 
                where they just get left on the ground for us to find and look 
                after. The boys, of course, are immediately looked after by the 
                state. No one knows who their real mothers and fathers are. Once 
                a woman's given birth, she's turfed out of the state hospital 
                and expected to fend for herself. There are unofficial committees 
                which look after our own welfare, and make sure women aren't left 
                to die when they're ill or disabled. There are unofficial hospitals, 
                unofficial local governments and unofficial housing committees. 
                We women look after ourselves. After all, if the men won't do 
                it for us, who else is there for us to turn to except ourselves?&quot;<p>
