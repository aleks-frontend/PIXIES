              <p>&quot;Unlike Amy would have done herself, Jeremy, I know you'll 
                take real good care of Lindsay,&quot; Trish said to me as I stood 
                before her, totally stunned by her words. She wiped a tear away 
                from her eyes and added, &quot;I want to go back home today. I 
                know it's short notice, but see what you can do. Please.&quot;<p>
                Searching for the ability to speak, I shook my head for a few 
                seconds before responding, &quot;I can't believe this, Trish. 
                I understand if you want to be with your friends and family in 
                Toronto more than staying here with us on the island. But come 
                on... there's only a week left before it will be time to go home. 
                Why do you want to go home NOW?&quot;<p>
                A new collection of tears began to form in Trish's eyes as she 
                replied, &quot;Because of Lindsay. I love her so much. Each new 
                day I spend here will only make the pain of losing her worse in 
                the future.&quot; She sniffed her nose and added, &quot;I can't 
                handle that. I just want to go home... today.&quot;<p>
                I let out a sigh and countered, &quot;If that is what you want 
                Trish... then so be it. I'll have you on a flight today.&quot;</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>I received the absolute shock of a lifetime this morning when 
                Trish showed up at my door and informed me that she wanted to 
                go back home - to Canada - today.<p>
                Her reason for wanting to leave was because Trish felt as if there 
                was no possible way that she could stay on the island past the 
                allotted ten weeks. She, along with several of the others, made 
                the original commitment to stay with me on the island indefinitely. 
                But with some time to think about it, Trish felt as though she 
                would miss her family and friends too much to bind herself down 
                here.<p>
                That was perfectly understandable - and I had no problem with 
                it. What I still could not figure out, however, was why Trish 
                wanted to go home RIGHT NOW. There was only a week left on the 
                island. It seemed as though she would want to stay, and enjoy 
                her final few days in paradise.<p>
                Earlier this morning, apparently, Trish told Lindsay of her decision 
                to go back home to Canada after the summer ended. Since they were 
                in love with each other, Trish fully expected Lindsay to immediately 
                give in and say that she wanted to go to Canada with her. Unfortunately 
                for Trish, however, Lindsay had different ideas.<p>
                The 18-year-old told her girlfriend and lover that she wanted 
                to stay on the island with not only me, but Pamela as well. Lindsay 
                said that except for a trip or two each year to visit her own 
                family in Ohio, she never wanted to leave the island. She loved 
                this tropical paradise too much.<p>
                That hurt Trish, naturally, but Lindsay was also feeling the effects 
                as well. She loved Trish with equal passion and fervor, but decided 
                her rightful place in life was on the island. Lindsay tried to 
                talk Trish out of her decision to go home. Trish, in turn, tried 
                to change Lindsay's mind about wanting to stay on the island.<p>
                Neither lady was successful.<p>
                Hurt and upset, Trish then stormed into my personal suite and 
                demanded that I send her home - right now. After a very long and 
                spirited conversation between us, Trish settled down and said 
                she trusted I would take good care of Lindsay. I then agreed to 
                have her on a flight sometime later today.<p>
                If she could not have Lindsay as the main focal point for the 
                rest of her life, Trish did not want to spend the final week here 
                on the island. She felt as though seeing Lindsay for these few 
                last days would prolong her hurt in the future. I did not necessarily 
                agree with that, or even understand it.<p>
                But that was how Trish felt - and I respected that.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>Joining the circle of hurt was none other than yours truly. From 
                the very first day on the island - some nine weeks ago - I had 
                watched the relationship between Lindsay and Trish first bloom, 
                then prosper. So much in love, they seemed absolutely perfect 
                together.<p>
                I thought out of all the couples on the island - except for Pamela 
                and myself, of course - these two went together better than any 
                of the others. Lindsay and Trish had a chemistry together which 
                was difficult to achieve in relationships. They loved each other 
                so very much.<p>
                Trish showing up at my door this morning and demanding that I 
                send her home was an absolute shock to me. It hurt me to see the 
                once-strong relationship she had with Lindsay suddenly in complete 
                and total shambles.<p>
                Only adding to my personal misery was the reason I felt I was 
                the one individual most responsible for this happening.<p>
                It was none other than yours truly who talked Lindsay into staying 
                on the island in the first place. She was all set to start a new 
                life in Toronto with Trish until I found that I personally never 
                wanted her to leave the island. So, in a bit of selfishness, I 
                talked Lindsay into staying here.<p>
                Things seemed perfectly fine at first, because Trish opted to 
                stay on the island as well. That way, both she and Lindsay could 
                still be together. Not only that, but I would get to experience 
                and enjoy Lindsay from now on myself.<p>
                However, as time went on, Trish came to the conclusion that her 
                family and friends in Canada were more important than committing 
                herself long-term here. They were so very important to her, in 
                fact, that she was willing to give up Lindsay to go back home 
                to them.<p>
                If I didn't persuade Lindsay into staying on the island, she and 
                Trish would still be together. They would be making plans for 
                the rest of their lives - in Canada - right now. I actually wanted 
                these two ladies to be together.<p>
                So, I had ample reason to feel as though this situation was entirely 
                my fault. It was not a good feeling, either.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>This news came the day after Amy and Torrie also decided that 
                they did not want to stay on the island, either. I kind of suspected 
                that, however, so their decision did not have quite the frightening 
                impact that Trish's did.<p>
                Amy and Torrie were total, depraved sluts whose rightful place 
                was in porn. It took them awhile, but they finally decided that 
                their home was not here on the island, but in front of the blue 
                movie camera. That was where both of them were originally set 
                to go before opting to stay on the island. A week later, they 
                decided porn was right for them.<p>
                I had the feeling that both of them - especially Amy - would change 
                their mind about wanting to stay here. Indeed, it was a major 
                loss for me... but one I fully expected.<p>
                It seemed that with their decision, I would forever have Pamela, 
                Lindsay and Trish here with me on the island. One could be my 
                wife (Pamela) while the other two (Lindsay and Trish) could portray 
                the naughty, bi-sexual couple next door for us. Unfortunately, 
                things would not turn out that way.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>I tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to talk Trish out of leaving 
                the island right away. I implored to her that she should at least 
                stay until the others went home in a week. Trish obviously loved 
                the island and all of the other girls;<p>
                I wanted her to enjoy her final few days here, too.<p>
                She would not give in, however. Trish wanted to go home as fast 
                as I could get her airline accommodations ready. If she were to 
                stay, Trish claimed her hurt of losing Lindsay would only multiply 
                with every passing day here. She felt as though the agony of that 
                would be too much to overcome.<p>
                After securing her an airline ticket online, I got in touch with 
                Ian - my helicopter pilot friend - and arranged for him to pick 
                Trish up in four hours. He would fly her to the mainland, then 
                see to it that she boarded her flight.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>Holding a glass of soda, I shut off the computer and went into 
                the voyeur room. Torrie and Amy were busy having sex at the outdoor 
                pool with each other, but that - for once - did not interest me. 
                Trish was in her room, packing her suitcases and getting the rest 
                of her belongings together.<p>
                When I found Lindsay on one of the monitors, however, I suddenly 
                lost control of myself. I roared out in anger, then flung the 
                glass of soda as hard as I could against the side wall - and thus, 
                shattering it into a million pieces.<p>
                I immediately regretted that move, not knowing I had such a quick 
                hair-trigger in me. But watching Lindsay cry and sob uncontrollably 
                really set me off.<p>
                My feelings for Lindsay have been very well chronicled throughout 
                this entire story. It simply tore me apart inside to see her crying 
                like that.<p>
                Fortunately, Pamela was there for Lindsay in her time of need. 
                I watched them on the monitor as Pamela held and comforted the 
                tender sweetheart in her arms, allowing her to get all those painful 
                emotions out of her system.<p>
                Lindsay had taken full advantage of that, too, as her pretty face 
                was completely soaked in tears. It appeared as though she had 
                been crying for a very long time. I took a bit of solace in the 
                fact that Pamela was there with her to offer an embrace and the 
                occasional cheek or forehead kiss.<p>
                However, I still felt responsible for this whole mess. Lindsay 
                and Trish should be together. If not for me, they would be. Despite 
                my intense feelings for Lindsay, and the unequaled need of her 
                in my life, I knew there was only one thing to do. That would 
                be, of course, the right thing.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>Without going through a detailed word-by-word account, let me 
                just say that when I made my way into the library - where Pamela 
                and Lindsay were - I had an extremely long and enlightening conversation 
                with both of them.<p>
                I told Lindsay that I wanted, despite my feelings, for her to 
                go to Canada with Trish. I felt as though both of them needed 
                to be together. I did not want Lindsay to miss out on being with 
                her true soul-mate in life, in exchange for my own selfish reasons.<p>
                It hurt me to say those words, but it was the right thing to do. 
                I both wanted and needed Lindsay in my life, but I felt as though 
                her rightful place was alongside Trish. I let her know this, and 
                insisted she hook back up with Trish.<p>
                I received another shock when Lindsay, through her tears, said 
                that she loved ME more than she ever did Trish. To be perfectly 
                honest, I never saw that coming - or even a hint at it. Lindsay 
                said that she had strong feelings for Trish and did love her a 
                great deal. However, she loved me more.<p>
                &quot;I thought you wanted to stay here on the island alone with 
                Pamela,&quot; the teen sobbed to me, still visibly upset over 
                Trish's decision to leave, while also letting these never-before-told 
                emotions pour out. &quot;I understood and accepted that. But... 
                I was so happy when you asked me to stay t-too. Now I had an invitation 
                to stay.&quot; Pamela gave Lindsay's forehead a kiss as she continued, 
                &quot;I've never wanted to leave the island from the very moment 
                I stepped foot on it. I love it, and I love you, Jeremy. This 
                whole place is one big paradise. I-I want to stay here forever.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You... you love me more than you do Trish?&quot; were my 
                stunned words, referring to her comment from moments ago.<p>
                &quot;Yes I do,&quot; Lindsay replied. &quot;I love Trish a whole 
                lot, but I love you more, Jeremy.&quot; She looked at Pamela and 
                added, &quot;I could also grow to love you.&quot; Pamela smiled 
                as Lindsay looked back at me. &quot;I have a way of keeping things 
                to myself, Jeremy - if I want to. That's why you never really 
                noticed this.&quot; Lindsay cracked her first grin all day as 
                she added, &quot;You never even suspected that I was a virgin 
                until Trish told you so. I kept it to myself.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Tell him what you told me,&quot; Pamela said to Lindsay.<p>
                The teen sniffed again before continuing, &quot;Seemed to me<p>
                as if you wanted to devote your life to Pamela, Jeremy. It was 
                okay with me, because I've always been for people being happy. 
                I loved you, but realized that your feelings for Pamela were stronger 
                than they were for me. It didn't seem like there was a place for 
                me amongst you two. So... I decided that my best alternative would 
                be Trish and Canada.&quot;<p>
                &quot;But when you asked me if I would stay here, with you and 
                Pamela... I felt over-joyed. I really did. I love you; I love 
                the island. This is where I want to be. Sure... I'd prefer Trish 
                staying here too. But she doesn't want to. I can promise you one 
                thing, though - I'll be more happy here on the island than I would 
                be in Toronto, with Trish. And that's saying nothing bad about 
                Trish.&quot;<p>
                Pamela released Lindsay and gave her a little nudge toward me. 
                The teen responded by hooking her arms around my shoulders and 
                embracing me tightly. &quot;I love you, Jeremy. I can be the third 
                wheel of a three-way relationship. You and Pamela go and get married 
                if you want to. Just let me come along for the ride too. I never 
                want to leave this place.&quot;<p>
                Encircling Lindsay with both arms, I was totally shocked and amazed 
                at these words while also looking at Pamela as she openly smiled 
                at us. &quot;You're okay with this, honey?&quot; I said to her. 
                &quot;I mean... I don't want there to be any jealousy between 
                you and Lindsay in the future.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Jealousy?&quot; Pamela laughed. &quot;I'm not the jealous 
                type.<p>
                Besides... there will be no reason for me to be jealous. I'll 
                be licking that little pussy of hers just as much, if not more, 
                than you'll be fucking it. I want Lindsay too.&quot;<p>
                Everyone wants Lindsay...</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>My whole summer with this group of ladies had been full of nothing 
                but wild twists and turns. However, nothing compared with Trish's 
                decision to suddenly leave.<p>
                Several of the girls tried to change Trish's mind about leaving 
                the island early, but their efforts fell upon deaf ears. Trish 
                said her good-byes to everyone, and shared a long and emotional 
                embrace with Lindsay. Lisa and Pamela tried one last time to change 
                her mind, but it was useless.<p>
                As I drove Trish in my Jeep to the helicopter landing pad on the 
                other side of the island, she did nothing but cry. I really felt 
                useless at this point myself. I also felt sick and very weak. 
                How else could I possibly feel?<p>
                It was obvious to me that Trish loved Lindsay with every single 
                every beat of her heart. I still wished, at least for her sake, 
                that they could be together.<p>
                I had to fight back the tears myself once we reached the landing 
                pad. I offered Trish's hand a gentlemanly kiss, and she responded 
                by embracing me tightly with both arms. My whole body shivered 
                as she then said, &quot;Please take care of Lindsay for me, Jeremy. 
                I trust that you will.&quot;<p>
                Her eyes glistening, Trish ended the warm embrace and then kissed 
                my cheek. She managed a quick smile, before turning and making 
                her way over to the helicopter.<p>
                I ran over to Trish, and reached for her from behind. She turned 
                to look at me as I said, &quot;You're welcome back here anytime 
                you want, Trish. You know how to get into touch with me through 
                e-mail. You can come back anytime... whether it be tomorrow, next 
                month or even next year.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I had the best summer of my entire life,&quot; the Canadian 
                quietly said, a new tear streaming down her face. &quot;I really 
                did. I'll never regret coming here. I just hope you take care 
                of Lindsay for me. I love her.&quot; Trish cracked another smile 
                before adding, &quot;Thanks... but no thanks, Jeremy. You won't 
                be hearing from me that I want to come here again.&quot;<p>
                I stepped closer and cradled her face with both hands, then wiped 
                away the tear with my thumb. Next, I kissed her forehead and said, 
                &quot;The offer is there, Trish, if you ever change your mind. 
                I know Lindsay would love you back here.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Lindsay...&quot; Trish sighed, a new set of tears forming 
                in her eyes. &quot;Oh, sweet Lindsay...&quot;<p>
                I offered Trish another hug, before giving her a cashier's check. 
                I could not send her home without any money.<p>
                Moments later, the helicopter took off and eventually disappeared 
                over the horizon. As I stood there and watched it do so, I felt 
                as though I was in a horrible dream. Did all of this really happen 
                to me?<p>
                Hopefully, I would soon wake up and realize that this whole day 
                had been nothing but a bad nightmare. I would find Lindsay and 
                Trish someplace on the island - hugging and kissing each other, 
                as they had so many times in the past.</p>

              <p>As I drove my Jeep back to the mansion, I realized that this 
                was no nightmare. Trish was really gone - for good. It was rather 
                unfortunate, to say the least.<p>
                Even on an island paradise where I geared everything to be harmoniously 
                perfect, there had been problems all summer. Some of those problems 
                were minor, while others were major.<p>
                But things like that simply could not be avoided. It was life. 
                And as people, we all know that things happen in our lives that 
                we don't always like. All anyone can do when a situation like 
                that occurs is deal with it... and move on.<p>
                No matter how bad this day was for me, I would not allow it to 
                dampen my final week on the island with all of the ladies. I would 
                also see to it that despite Trish's hasty departure, the group 
                of Lisa, Torrie, Christina and Amy would leave this island with 
                nothing but positive feelings.<p>
                This final week was going to be very interesting. If I had anything 
                to say about it - which I did - it would also be very energetic, 
                lively and most of all, full of fun.<p>
                That was a promise which I made to myself. And I had every intention 
                of keeping it.</p>
