                In Which we learn about the rewards and joy of unbridled pleasure, 
                but also see how it may compromise the better virtues of Innocence 
                and Chastity.
              <p>What could be done about Null? wondered Kedi as she sat astride 
                Innocence thrusting her crotch backwards and forwards on Innocence's 
                wonderful penis. She was unable to avoid wondering about this 
                as Null was sitting opposite her on the floor, chained as always 
                to the furniture frantically masturbating herself while Innocence 
                and Kedi were in the throes of mutual passion. What talents does 
                Null have? Kedi continued to wonder as the two exhausted lovers 
                collapsed together and a trickle of Innocence's semen flowed down 
                her inside leg.<p>
                &quot;What would you say is Null's greatest asset?&quot; Kedi 
                asked Innocence as they cuddled up together watching the girl 
                lick her hands of the lubrication she'd generated from her cunt.<p>
                &quot;Her sex drive?&quot; suggested Innocence, obviously imagining 
                that Kedi already knew.<p>
                &quot;Sex drive?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well, no one else can go on and on and on like she does 
                and keep up the same level of enthusiasm.&quot;<p>
                Kedi could only agree and this became the basis of an idea she 
                developed. Null was certainly a girl who could take partner after 
                partner, and continue doing so all day. Why then not charge people 
                for the privilege of doing so? Kedi had had enough experience 
                from organising her own sex shows to see exactly how this exercise 
                could be done. And soon with the assistance of Innocence and her 
                sister she put her idea into practice. Mouse said that she'd like 
                to help, but as her priorities were to do with preparing for her 
                departure to sing and dance and have sex on stage Kedi actively 
                dissuaded her. &quot;There is enough for you to do. And it is 
                not much work we have to do either.&quot;<p>
                Indeed, to a certain extent there wasn't. Kedi found a garage 
                she could rent at a reasonable rate in the town centre which she 
                kitted up with a bed and sheets she managed to find in a deserted 
                building. She then made the interior of the garage as much like 
                a bedroom as she could, with erotic pictures that she's borrowed 
                from Mouse that were in fact promotional photographs of productions 
                she'd been involved in. Any discriminating visitor would have 
                soon established that there were rather more pictures of Mouse 
                than of anyone else.<p>
                However, discriminating visitors were not what Kedi was anticipating 
                as she set up a stall outside the garage, just by the door that 
                led into it from the side. It was just visitors willing to pay 
                a reasonable and relatively competitive rate for five or ten minutes 
                of sex. Indeed, what Kedi had decided on was to supply conveyor 
                belt sex with Null as the main provider of this commodity. Above 
                the door, she hung the sign Five Minute Fuck, and underneath the 
                actual rate and a picture of Null in a lascivious attitude. This 
                photograph was not difficult to take, - the difficulty was determining 
                which of the many lascivious and frankly sluttish photographs 
                most promoted Null's unique properties.<p>
                Attracting custom was not initially easy, but Chastity and Innocence 
                helped Kedi by handing out leaflets advertising Null's unique 
                skills and, of course, the exceptionally reasonable rate. As the 
                leaflet made clear - how could a potential customer possibly afford 
                not to take advantage of the offer? What Kedi was not sure was 
                if what she was doing was making Null a prostitute against her 
                will or if, indeed, what Null was doing could properly be called 
                prostitution. However, on the first fairly slack days, when it 
                was Kedi's turn to supervise Null's lovemaking rather than to 
                collect pay at a table from visitors queuing up to come in, she 
                came to the conclusion that she was really just providing a service 
                for Null and if there was some pecuniary compensation for it then 
                that could not be bad. Null was so clearly grateful for the sex 
                she was receiving and so reluctant to see each customer leave 
                that Kedi couldn't really consider that Null was being exploited.<p>
                Null's success at providing the perfect Five Minute Fuck was not 
                immediate. In the first weeks or so, it was quite difficult to 
                release Null from customers who delighted as they were at getting 
                rather more than their money's worth had really decided that they'd 
                had enough. Null was almost inconsolable when a customer had left, 
                and soon Innocence and Chastity had to provide assistance in giving 
                the oversexed Null sexual satisfaction as well as assisting Kedi 
                with the organisation of the venture. Soon however, the one or 
                maybe two customers an hour had grown to be a constant queue of 
                men and occasionally women who would patiently wait their time 
                to have their moment of sexual release. At lunch time on a working 
                day, this queue might stretch several yards along the road and 
                provided obstructions to other businesses which was only compensated 
                by the extra trade these businesses themselves were gaining.<p>
                The pattern had soon set in, with Kedi, Innocence and Chastity 
                taking turns at collecting money from customers before seeing 
                Null and restraining Null from continuing to have sex with a customer 
                who was either clearly finished or had exceeded his five minutes. 
                Null was certainly much happier now and it was only because the 
                three girls couldn't maintain their roles for twenty four hours 
                a day that Null ever got to finish making love at all.<p>
                &quot;Is there any limit to Null's sexual appetite?&quot; Innocence 
                exclaimed, as late at night after the last people in the queue 
                had been satisfied (and usually in substantially less than the 
                promised five minutes), Null was still clamouring for Innocence 
                to fuck her.<p>
                &quot;Is there a way to find out?&quot; wondered Chastity, who 
                then came up with the idea of a Fuckathon. This, she said, would 
                be to simply ask people to take turns in fucking Null, and keep 
                it going until Null could keep going no longer. They would pay 
                for the privilege of being in the Fuckathon and they could invite 
                newspapers and television reporters to witness Null's phenomenal 
                achievement.<p>
                &quot;But shouldn't we collect the money for a charity or something?&quot; 
                queried Innocence who really didn't know of her sister ever doing 
                anything if there wasn't some distinct advantage to herself in 
                it.<p>
                &quot;We can give a certain amount to a charity, I suppose,&quot; 
                Chastity conceded, &quot;but only after we award ourselves pay 
                for the administrative costs.&quot;<p>
                Neither Kedi nor Innocence was that sure of Chastity's sincerity 
                concerning any charitable activity, but they helped Chastity book 
                a room with a raised platform and seats for an audience and helped 
                her in promoting the Fuckathon. This event attracted rather more 
                attention than even Chastity had anticipated, but this was mostly 
                because of the reputation already generated from Kedi's Five Minute 
                Fuck enterprise. There were a large number of sponsors willing 
                to pay considerably more for the privilege of taking part in the 
                event than they would normally need to do for Null's services. 
                Kedi's main hope was that they wouldn't run out of fuckers before 
                Null finally gave up.<p>
                On the day on which the event began - and it was anticipated that 
                it would continue for several days - Kedi was gratified to see 
                the hall was full and not just with participants but with observers, 
                reporters and television cameras. In fact one television station, 
                fronted by a woman with short hair, a business suit and large 
                breasts that deliberately burst free from her jacket, was to film 
                the whole event, but not to actually screen it all. This woman 
                started off by describing the event to her viewers, - which included 
                the stage, the participants and, most importantly of all, Null 
                herself. This woman interviewed both Innocence and Chastity whom 
                she described as the main organisers of the event, but pointedly 
                avoided interviewing Kedi, although she had more to do with its 
                organisation than anyone else. Kedi would have been more offended 
                had she not lived in Wonderground for so long and become rather 
                accustomed to such casual racism.<p>
                Several reporters had tried to interview Null as she lay chained 
                to the side of the stage before the event, but were soon discouraged 
                by her inability to understand their questions, to form any answers 
                and to restrain herself from trying to sexually assault them. 
                However, when the event started it was much easier to focus on 
                her as participant after participant came on stage in agreed turns, 
                paid their money, and fucked Null.<p>
                This routine went on and on, and soon the commentators found that 
                really there were only two things they could do. One was to praise 
                the participants in working so hard for charity and making the 
                event such a success (and forbearing to mention those whose sexual 
                performance was not quite adequate and who after the prescribed 
                maximum time had to be taken off stage without achieving any successful 
                sex at all). The other was to pass comment on Null's unflagging 
                sexual enthusiasm, her frequent, noisy and often explosive orgasms 
                and what a marvellous performer she was. This must have become 
                very boring for both spectators and commentators after a while 
                as after a full day of sex, Null continued through the night and 
                into the next day with no apparent sign of fatigue.<p>
                This state of affairs just continued and continued, and by the 
                eighth day in which Null had not slept at all, the audience which 
                had thinned out after the second day was packing out the hall 
                as spectators observed for themselves a phenomenon of sexual stamina 
                that most hadn't believed possible. Kedi's fears of a lack of 
                fuckers proved to be unfounded as the fame of Null and the Fuckathon 
                had spread beyond Wonderground and people were rushing to participate 
                from everywhere.<p>
                And then, just when it seemed that Null would never tire, indeed 
                after she'd just yet again exploded into orgasmic screams that 
                echoed throughout the hall and frightened off a flock of pigeons 
                outside, she suddenly collapsed underneath the man who was fucking 
                her at the time and fell asleep. The Fuckathon was then over.<p>
                Kedi was relieved. She wondered whether Null would be all right 
                after such relentless fucking, but she was and a few days later, 
                after she'd recovered from an immensely long sleep she was back 
                at the Five Minute Fuck, with her name in much larger letters 
                and a photograph of the Fuckathon, being charged out at somewhat 
                more extortionate rates than before.<p>
                Null didn't understand why, but she felt that she was being treated 
                with rather more respect and consideration than she'd ever had 
                before. Her most pressing need, which was for frequent and unrestrained 
                sex, was at last being satisfied and she was very grateful to 
                the women who'd made it possible for her. Now that Mouse had left 
                to perform elsewhere, there were now only three others sharing 
                the flat, and although she wasn't able to quantify it in any way, 
                their quality of life had somehow improved as well. She really 
                had no suspicion that in some way her prodigious sexual appetite 
                was the reason why none of the girls needed to work any more, 
                beyond facilitating her own services to the many clients who would 
                queue up for them.<p>
                Innocence was now quite lonely now that her lover had gone, and 
                she had decided not to share her bed permanently with Kedi or 
                her sister, though this didn't prevent her having sex with them 
                on frequent occasions. Her times with Null were mostly spent with 
                the sole intent on giving the girl the kind of care and attention 
                she quite obviously needed. Innocence, however, was the only one 
                of the girls who ever came to her for sex, but the one who was 
                most attentive to her these days was Chastity. When Null was out 
                of the now sumptuously decorated flat, away from the massive video 
                and stereo system, and not lounging in the comfortable luxury 
                furniture, she would either be providing her Five Minute Fuck 
                or, increasingly, be escorted by Chastity to the premises of some 
                man who seemed delighted by the extent of her sexual desire.<p>
                There seemed to be an endless procession of these visits in premises 
                more sumptuous even than those she'd become accustomed at her 
                flat, where men with great wealth, sometimes singly and sometimes 
                in groups with participating women, would assist her in indulging 
                in all sorts of sexual activity. She would be urinated on, have 
                faeces dropped onto her, would have whole hands pushed inside 
                her while her anus was being filled by all sorts of objects, sometimes 
                manacled and chained, sometimes slapped, but always having close 
                intimate attention. This was what she craved and what she demanded. 
                And in all this, Chastity would be out of sight waiting for her, 
                and would only appear when, after hours of sexual activity it 
                was time to leave. And quite often she would be handling a large 
                wad of notes.<p>
                Null was not totally insensitive to the atmosphere at the flat 
                which often seemed strained, with Innocence and Kedi arguing with 
                Chastity it seemed about the very money which Chastity was collecting 
                from Innocence's clients. They somehow appeared rather less than 
                enthusiastic about her new activities. Often at the end of these 
                arguments, Innocence would sit with a Null restrained by chain 
                and cunt-ring and talk to her. Null had no idea what Innocence 
                was saying, but it seemed very sympathetic and tearful. What troubled 
                her was that these conversations didn't necessarily lead to sex, 
                but she supposed that Innocence was getting some gratification 
                from them.<p>
                There then came a period where with apparent reluctance from Chastity, 
                Null found herself totally deprived of all sex except from Innocence. 
                Indeed only Innocence and Kedi ever came to speak to her, while 
                Chastity might be seen looking at Null from round the corner of 
                a door. This abstinence upset Null. She flung herself bodily at 
                the two girls and masturbated with everything she could find, 
                including her food. She weeped from frustration and beat her cunt 
                hard to stimulate sensation from it. On one occasion she hit it 
                so hard that it started to bleed, and she took consolation in 
                letting the blood gather in her hands and then licking them. When 
                Innocence found her lying on the sheets with a puddle of blood 
                between her legs, she shrieked and was soon joined by the other 
                two girls who argued vehemently amongst themselves what should 
                be done.<p>
                The result of this was a return to visiting men again in Chastity's 
                custody - something which clearly pleased her, but appeared to 
                give less pleasure to the other two. Chastity had started talking 
                to her at greater depth and indeed to show a great deal more affection 
                than before. She didn't however appear to be particularly enthusiastic 
                about having sex with her. She also now took on the responsibility 
                of feeding her, washing her and combing her hair - tasks that 
                previously only the other two had ever done. <p>
                Null was happy to return to fucking. She didn't mind who fucked 
                her. Women with dildos, dogs, donkeys, children - it didn't matter! 
                Chastity also didn't mind, it seemed - being more concerned with 
                the money she was receiving. Null missed the Five Minute Fuck, 
                although her own perception of it had been of a paradise served 
                by an unending queue of fuckers.<p>
                However, she was vaguely aware that things were due to change 
                again - and found some of Chastity's attention rather more clinging 
                than before. She also became aware that the other two girls approached 
                her in a way that she'd experienced before whenever she was due 
                to leave somewhere. The change when it came though was not totally 
                unexpected.<p>
                The evening before was one she spent making love to both Innocence 
                and Kedi with Chastity watching unhappily from a chair. Innocence 
                was much more passionate than usual and greatly attentive to giving 
                the girl as much pleasure as she could. Although, Null shared 
                her penis with Kedi, she got the feeling that Innocence was making 
                a special effort to fuck Null principally. The lovemaking went 
                on through the night, and was punctuated with tears and some arguing 
                from Chastity. <p>
                The following day, she was awoken by the three girls who hugged 
                and kissed her in a sorrowful manner, and then she was introduced 
                to a new companion who was a tall middle-aged woman in a long 
                white coat and with a very sad smile. This companion took Null 
                around the shoulders and cuddled her firmly to her bosom, restraining 
                her at the same time from any sexual activity. Her hair was stroked 
                and her face was tenderly kissed. She was then put into a strange 
                jacket whose sleeves pulled her arms across her waist and prevented 
                her from moving. There followed a peculiar ceremony of tears and 
                kisses and cuddles from the three girls, which somehow she knew 
                meant that there wouldn't be any more sex with them again. Null 
                had experienced occasions like this before, but never so intently.<p>
                All of a sudden, something deep inside her cracked and she started 
                crying and blubbing and weeping unrestrainedly. She felt surprise 
                as her eyes started pouring out tears whose salt trail mingled 
                in her mouth with the dribble of snot from her nose to produce 
                a very salty taste. Although no one had hit her, she felt the 
                same bruised and damaged feeling about her lower face that she'd 
                usually only experienced after rough sex with men of peculiarly 
                cruel taste.<p>
                The last Null saw of her companions were the three of them through 
                the window of the white car waving again and again at her as it 
                drove away with her and her new companions. Kedi was standing 
                naked as always, while Chastity and Innocence had their arms around 
                each other with Innocence crying almost as much as Null was. Her 
                new companions spoke to her and cuddled her, but as the realisation 
                of the perhaps permanent loss of her lovers became clearer, Null 
                began screaming and wailing inconsolably - and continued to do 
                so for several more weeks until she could no longer clearly remember 
                just what it was she was missing so terribly.<p>
