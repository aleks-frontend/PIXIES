              <p>Chapter 4<p>
                By wc63
              <p><p>
                He was awake. There was a sound echoing down the long empty lower 
                corridors of the arena, faint but growing steadily louder. People 
                running, two or three. A yell. The footfalls suddenly close, another 
                shout; `Hold it right there!'. Amanda wakes up, begins to sit 
                up when the door slams open against the wall with an incredibly 
                loud bang, and she screams.<p>
                In very quick succession:<p>
                A figure in parka and toque sprints across the room, leaps completely 
                over the bed, brandishes a half inch wrench and screams `LET HER 
                GO!'.<p>
                Corey raises his hands like Amanda's skin is scalding him.<p>
                A man in black jacket and pants bursts through the door, quick-draws 
                a chrome .45 automatic from a shoulder holster and takes military 
                aim at the figure with the wrench, and yells `DON'T MAKE ME DO 
                IT!'<p>
                Amanda turns her face to Corey's and blurts in a voice full of 
                fear: &quot;My sister Cindy!&quot;.<p>
                The figure in winter gear raises it's hands but also ducks behind 
                the bed.<p>
                The man at the door raises the gun to rest position beside his 
                ear.<p>
                Everything freezes. The moment stretches. Suddenly, Corey lifts 
                his butt off the bed and whips the covers down to below his knees, 
                then sits up, lifts his feet, and throws the covers over his and 
                Amanda's nudity. He holds his hand out to the figure beside the 
                bed, and is handed the wrench. He tells the man at the door;<p>
                &quot;It's cool, Marcus. She has my full authorization.&quot;<p>
                Marcus returned the gun to it's holster, saying;<p>
                &quot;Sorry about the scare, Boss. She shouldn't have gotten this 
                far. That one on the bed with you must've left the door unlocked. 
                I didn't expect that. Pretty embarrassing, letting two of 'em 
                get by in one night. When did she get in?&quot;<p>
                &quot;About twenty minutes after the show last night, actually, 
                and I'm sorry I didn't let you know she was here.&quot; Corey 
                told him. &quot;I'm surprised you're still here, you're only on 
                duty till two.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yah, well, when the limo guys went home, I figured I'd keep 
                an eye on things around here, in case you needed anything.&quot; 
                Marcus replied. &quot;There's a snow storm outside. I talked to 
                the crew on the cell phone. All the trucks are stuck at a truck 
                stop outside of town. You mind if I grab a Coke an' a sandwich 
                at the bar before I head back to the security office?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Sure.&quot; Corey turned to the person who was apparently 
                Amanda's sister Cindy.<p>
                &quot;Which grate?&quot; he asked her.<p>
                &quot;Third window men's room, blue section.&quot; Came the reply 
                in a girl's voice that sounded almost exactly like Amanda's.<p>
                &quot;Do me a favor Marcus?&quot; Corey asked. &quot;Take this 
                wrench. You'll find it fits the bolts that have been taken out 
                of a window grate on the third window of the men's room in blue 
                section. If you could put it back, I'd appreciate if you could 
                keep this out of Arena Security's log. What do you think?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Sure, no problem Boss.&quot;<p>
                With a submarine sandwich in cellophane under one arm and a can 
                of coke in that hand, Marcus tucked the wrench into a back pocket 
                with the other, and let himself out.<p>
                Another long moment of silence.<p>
                &quot;Competent guy, that Marcus.&quot; Corey announced conversationally. 
                &quot;He saved my life once.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Cindy asked Amanda.<p>
                &quot;I'm fine.&quot; Amanda replied, her voice still shaking 
                a little. &quot;Cindy, this is Corey Michaels. Corey, this is 
                my sister Cindy.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You're alright.&quot; Cindy stated straightforwardly. &quot;I'm 
                sweating to death. Jesus Christ.&quot; Then she seemed to snap 
                out of it, and into rage;<p>
                &quot;JESUS CHRIST, AMANDA! YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO CALL IF YOU WERE 
                GOING TO STAY MORE THAN AN HOUR! IT'S SIX A.M.! HOW MANY TIMES 
                DID I MAKE YOU PROMISE YOU WERE GOING TO CALL AND LET ME KNOW 
                YOU WERE ALL RIGHT! CHRIST!&quot; She whipped the toque off her 
                head and threw it at the floor like a triumphant football player 
                spiking in the end zone. She continued ripping off pieces of outerwear 
                and throwing them around the room as she continued her enraged 
                tirade. &quot;I'VE BEEN GOING CRAZY ALL NIGHT WORRYING ABOUT YOU, 
                WONDERING WHETHER YOU'RE GETTING YOURSELF BEATEN TO DEATH, I GET 
                DOWN HERE AND THAT ASSHOLE CHASES ME THROUGH THE WHOLE DAMN ARENA, 
                I GET IN HERE AND YOU'RE SCREAMING LIKE YOU'RE BEING FUCKING RAPED, 
                FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!&quot; She had finished with her scarf, mitts, 
                and jacket, and sat heavily on the edge of the bed to pull her 
                boots off, still yelling at the top of her lungs. &quot;AND THEN 
                HE POINTS THAT BIG FUCKING GUN AT ME, AND I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA 
                DIE, AND NOW I BET YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME YOU FORGOT, RIGHT?!!!&quot;<p>
                She finished with her boots and buried her face in her hands. 
                Taking three deep breaths, she continued in a very quiet voice; 
                &quot;God, Amanda. When I saw him pull that gun out and aim it 
                at me, and I was looking right into the barrel, I really thought 
                he was gonna kill me.&quot; She started to cry with silent shudders.<p>
                Cindy was a little taller than Amanda, maybe five foot two, and 
                her hair was very light blond, almost white, straight and halfway 
                down her back except for her bangs resting on her eyebrows. Where 
                Amanda was lightly tan, Cindy had a healthy pink `peaches and 
                cream' complexion. She was as slim as Amanda, but had a more delicate, 
                bikini-model type build, lacking the physical development that 
                gave Amanda her aerobics-instructor looking body. And she was 
                beautiful. He could see why Amanda judged herself harshly in comparison 
                to Cindy. He could tell through her tight sweater that her breasts 
                were just a touch smaller than Amanda's, and from what he could 
                tell under her jeans, their buns were exactly the same.<p>
                When Cindy began to cry, Amanda moved to console her. For a moment 
                Corey was worried that she was going to pull both herself and 
                the blankets off of him, so he scooted sideways till his hip was 
                almost touching Cindy's back. Amanda turned to put a foot on either 
                side of Cindy on the bed and hugged her, and Cindy turned sideways 
                and hugged her back as they cried out their fear and tension.<p>
                &quot;I'm sorry, Cindy, I'm so sorry...&quot; Amanda sobbed into 
                her sister's shoulder. Finally they got their emotions under control, 
                and Cindy told Amanda:<p>
                &quot;I want to speak to you in private.&quot;<p>
                &quot;No. I'm sorry, Cindy, but I know he doesn't want me to. 
                I'm an adult now, and you're going to have to respect this decision.&quot;<p>
                &quot;But I can't talk in front of him!&quot; Cindy hissed.<p>
                &quot;Yes you can, Cindy! You know you can trust him.&quot; Amanda 
                re-assured her. &quot;Just pretend he isn't here.&quot;<p>
                Cindy wavered in indecision for a few moments, till her need to 
                know overcame her reluctance.<p>
                &quot;Fine.&quot; she said. &quot;Why didn't you call?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well,&quot; Amanda began, blushing and looking down, &quot;An 
                hour after I got here, his mouth was on my pussy and he was giving 
                me the most incredible orgasm I've ever had. Actually, the second 
                most incredible, now. I know that's no excuse. I really wish I 
                had something better to tell you, but the truth is, I did forget.&quot;<p>
                Cindy stared at her open-mouthed, surprised that she could be 
                so blatant in front of Corey.<p>
                &quot;So,&quot; Cindy stammered, &quot;Everything went well?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Oh, so much better than `well'.&quot; Amanda reassured her, 
                happily. &quot;You just wouldn't believe how excellent it's been! 
                I must've cum ten times, plus all the ones I had when I was sleeping!&quot;<p>
                &quot;Cool.&quot; Cindy stated, relieved. She flashed Corey a 
                glance over her shoulder, and scratched at her ribcage under one 
                arm before continuing. &quot;So, you didn't make him hurt you?&quot; 
                Amanda's countenance fell.<p>
                &quot;Well, I did, but not much. Just when he was putting it in 
                me, at first, and a little later when he squeezed my titties a 
                bit.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Shit.&quot; Cindy swore under her breath. &quot;Did you 
                hurt him?&quot;<p>
                Amanda looked like she wanted to crawl under the covers and hide. 
                She finally answered in a little tiny voice;<p>
                &quot;Yes.&quot;<p>
                &quot;God dammit Amanda!&quot; Cindy burst out, &quot;You promised 
                you wouldn't!&quot; She glared daggers at her sister for a moment, 
                then continued in a more calm tone of voice. &quot;How is he?&quot;<p>
                &quot;He's okay. He's not injured.&quot; Amanda replied hesitantly. 
                &quot;I did what I could for him, but I don't know how well I 
                did. I'm too close to the situation to judge.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Shit.&quot; Cindy said to herself, &quot;You can say that 
                again.&quot; She closed her eyes and took a couple of deep breaths, 
                and seemed to gather herself for something.<p>
                Just when Corey was about to comment on how weird it was to be 
                talked about like he wasn't even there, Cindy turned to him and 
                looked him directly in the eyes. She had the brightest blue eyes 
                he'd ever seen, and she held him locked to her gaze long enough 
                for him to think to himself; 'Christ. She really can look right 
                into your soul.'<p>
                &quot;How do you feel?&quot; she asked him. It was incredible, 
                like a hypnotic command. He tried to say: `Hey, I'm fine, no problem 
                here.', but his mouth disobeyed his brain. What his mouth actually 
                said was:<p>
                &quot;I'm not proud of all the things I enjoyed last night. I 
                think I can handle it. Amanda's an emotional roller coaster, but 
                it's been the experience of a lifetime.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Did she try to make you put it in her bum?&quot; Cindy asked.<p>
                &quot;She mentioned it...&quot;<p>
                &quot;And did you?&quot;<p>
                &quot;No.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Did she try to make you hit her?&quot; Cindy enquired.<p>
                &quot;She mentioned a spanking...&quot; Corey admitted.<p>
                &quot;And did you spank her?&quot;<p>
                &quot;No.&quot; Corey said.<p>
                &quot;Then you should be proud of what you enjoyed.&quot; She 
                reassured him as she gave his shoulder a little shake. &quot;Amanda 
                obviously enjoyed it, and you showed more self control than most 
                men would have. If you're going to have her around, she'll get 
                you to do the rest of it to her eventually anyway, so you might 
                as well have a healthy attitude about it.&quot;<p>
                She broke the eye contact, releasing him, and he sagged back against 
                the pillows, amazed at the intensity of it. And he felt... better.<p>
                &quot;He'll be fine.&quot; Cindy reassured Amanda. Amanda turned 
                to Corey;<p>
                &quot;Pretty wild, huh?&quot; she asked him with a smile. &quot;Told 
                yah she was spooky.&quot; He could only nod.<p>
                &quot;So,&quot; Cindy said to Amanda, &quot;I guess you might 
                as well tell me what happened. Briefly.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Briefly?&quot; Amanda considered. &quot;Briefly. I came 
                in, he was only wearing a towel, he told me to tell him how I 
                got in or he'd call the cops. I told him, and told him I was here 
                to make love to him, and stripped down to my tights, and hugged 
                him and rubbed myself against him and sucked his nipple. He was 
                going to send me home with a C.D. but he was getting stiff, so 
                I took his towel off and touched him with my hand. Then he said 
                he'd do it for me.&quot;<p>
                &quot;No doubt.&quot; Cindy interjected, somewhat sarcastically.<p>
                &quot;So then we kissed,&quot; Amanda continued, &quot;And he 
                carried me to the chair, and I tested him.&quot;<p>
                &quot;That soon?&quot; Cindy asked, &quot;What did he do?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I wanted to get past it and I knew he'd do fine. Wow Cindy, 
                you wouldn't believe how excellent it is! He's so perfectly balanced 
                on the line that he gets mad at me and asks if I realize he can 
                hurt me!&quot;<p>
                &quot;Wow.&quot; Cindy breathed.<p>
                &quot;Yah!&quot; Amanda continued. &quot;And then he carried me 
                over to the bed and gave me the most glorious orgasm with his 
                hand. Only when I was done, he kept rubbing me till I was going 
                crazy!&quot;<p>
                &quot;Serves you right, you little minx.&quot; Cindy threw in.<p>
                &quot;So then he wipes my whole body down with a warm cloth, makes 
                me drink apple juice, shoves his face in my bum, and does the 
                wildest things in my bumhole with his tongue. Then he rubs his 
                face all over my body and then that's when he got me in the pussy 
                with his mouth. I'm leaving most of the good stuff out, but it 
                was incredible.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Mm hm.&quot; went Cindy. She flashed Corey a little glance, 
                made a motion like she was thinking of touching herself, turned 
                it into another little scratch at her side.<p>
                &quot;And then we made love, but it was really close. He wasn't 
                gonna do it at first, cuz he's really big and he didn't want to 
                hurt me, but I talked him into it. He finally put it into me until 
                I was full, and we both came. So then he wipes me down with the 
                cloth again, and I did the same for him, and I realize that he's 
                got this much he's not putting inside me.&quot; She held her thumb 
                and finger about four inches apart. Corey reached past her and 
                squeezed them together till they were two inches apart. <p>
                &quot;I couldn't get him to put the rest into me, then he told 
                me to do it if I wanted it so much. I pushed real hard but I couldn't 
                get it all into me, so I just dropped myself on it. That's how 
                I hurt him. And he's been doing it to me constantly ever since. 
                Even while we were showering. Even when we were sleeping. Even 
                right now.&quot;<p>
                &quot;He's still inside you? Right now?&quot; Cindy asked, amazed.<p>
                &quot;Mm hmm.&quot; Amanda agreed. She slowly gathered the blankets 
                in front of her and raised them to her waist, showing Cindy that 
                his manhood was indeed still deep inside her naked little quim. 
                Cindy could only watch in helpless fascination as Amanda slowly 
                put one hand behind herself, braced it on Corey's left hip, and 
                oh-so-slowly raised herself off him until only half the head was 
                left in, and paused.<p>
                &quot;My God!&quot; Cindy exclaimed. &quot;He's huge!&quot;<p>
                &quot;He is, isn't he?&quot; Amanda replied with a smug little 
                smile. She slowly lowered herself down till he touched her cervix.<p>
                &quot;I'm full here. I have to stretch to take him the rest of 
                the way.&quot; Amanda demonstrated as she spoke, and Cindy could 
                see the tension trying to pull the outside of her pussy inside 
                her with the base of his cock.<p>
                Corey decided to himself that he wasn't going to say a word.<p>
                &quot;Wow!&quot; Cindy stated. Fascinated, she slowly reached 
                out and touched her sister with a fingertip at the edge of her 
                opening, brushing the base of his shaft. Amanda felt stretched 
                as tight as a drum there.<p>
                &quot;That must... hurt.&quot; Cindy breathed softly.<p>
                &quot;Oh yes.&quot; Amanda replied with a raised eyebrow and a 
                satisfied grin, &quot;It does. But it also feels so good. I'm 
                so full, I feel so... womanly.&quot; She pushed the covers aside 
                and gently took Cindy's hand in both of hers, pressed it's palm 
                against her belly button and bounced a bit. Cindy could feel the 
                immensity of Corey's manhood moving inside Amanda's body, and 
                was completely mind-blown. She moved her hand away and pressed 
                her ear against Amanda's belly, looking down, like she was listening 
                for it's heartbeat. She blushed dark pink, then red. Amanda gently 
                cradled Cindy's head to her belly and slowly rubbed her loins 
                against Corey's.<p>
                &quot;He's going to keep me, Cindy. He's going to keep me for 
                a long time, he told me. I feel so grateful whenever I think about 
                it, I can hardly talk.&quot; For a minute no one spoke or moved 
                except Amanda's little rubs against Corey. Finally, Amanda noticed 
                a feeling of wetness on her tummy.<p>
                &quot;Cindy?&quot; she asked. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Oh yah. I'm fine.&quot; Cindy stated, and she did sound 
                like nothing was wrong.<p>
                &quot;Cindy.&quot; Amanda stated quietly. &quot;I can feel your 
                tears on my tummy. They're trickling down onto...&quot;<p>
                &quot;Please. Amanda. Don't gloat.&quot; Cindy interrupted.<p>
                &quot;What?&quot; Amanda asked, confused.<p>
                &quot;Please. Cover yourself. Cover him.&quot; Cindy said, and 
                reached around Amanda herself to draw the blankets back around 
                her sister's shoulders and tuck them closed in front of her breasts.<p>
                &quot;What's wrong, Cindy? I thought you'd be happy for me, it 
                all worked better than we hoped!&quot; Amanda said worriedly.<p>
                &quot;Amanda.&quot; Cindy said tiredly. &quot;I'm trying to be 
                happy for you, really I am. But you've gotta understand. When 
                I knew they weren't coming back, I promised myself that I'd finish 
                raising you right. Sometimes the responsibility of looking after 
                you was the only thing that kept me going. I tried so hard to 
                keep you on the right track and in school, and when I found out 
                you were... were kinky, I thought I'd be able to get you to want 
                more... healthy things, and I know you tried hard. And now you've 
                given yourself in sexual bondage to a rock star you never met 
                before yesterday, and I helped you do it. Now that it's really 
                happened, I can't help but feel that I've failed you. And you're 
                going to leave, and I'll be all alone in that big old house, with 
                no mom, no dad, no you, and no purpose in life.&quot; Cindy's 
                voice and face were calm, but tears were streaming down her cheeks. 
                Amanda looked like she was going to cry too, but was holding it 
                in.<p>
                &quot;Cindy, please don't feel that way!&quot; Amanda pleaded. 
                &quot;You've been the best, the very best, you've cared for me 
                more than anyone could ever expect a sister to do for another, 
                you know that! I'm so, so thankful for everything you've done 
                for me! And now you can live the life you deserve, and live for 
                yourself, and go back to college! You did finish raising me, and 
                you did a great job, but now that job is done, and we have to 
                go on. You know that as well as me.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yah I know, you're right.&quot; Cindy told her. &quot;It 
                just hurts, that's all.&quot; She laid her head on Amanda's shoulder 
                and they hugged. Corey saw Cindy flash him only the quickest glance, 
                and she lost control of her facial expression for just a second. 
                Then she was back to the calm expression, tears running down her 
                cheeks. She rubbed her arm against her side like she had an itch.<p>
                But it was too late. He'd seen the look, and his subconscious 
                began flashing it's little error flag. Data was reviewed, and 
                implications traced. Conclusions were spit whole into his conscious 
                mind. Suddenly, he had to know if they were correct.<p>
                &quot;And?&quot; he prompted gently. Cindy's eyes flashed wide 
                open in panic. She stared wide eyed at Corey over Amanda's shoulder, 
                made little side to side shakes with her head, and mouthed at 
                him silently: `No! No! Don't!'<p>
                &quot;And what?&quot; Amanda asked, pulling back from Cindy's 
                hug to look at their faces. She saw the quiet determination on 
                Corey's face, the silent pleading on Cindy's. Finally she turned 
                to Corey and said to him;<p>
                &quot;I don't know what you're implying, but my sister would never...&quot;<p>
                &quot;Listen.&quot; he interrupted. &quot;She changed into her 
                sexiest under things just before she came over here.&quot;<p>
                Both girls stared at him open-mouthed in surprise. Amanda turned 
                to Cindy.<p>
                &quot;Did you?&quot; she asked incredulously. Cindy covered her 
                mouth with her hands, looked at Amanda, and gave two little nods.<p>
                &quot;Christ.&quot; Amanda said to Corey in amazement. &quot;You're 
                as spooky as she is! How the hell did you know that?!&quot;<p>
                &quot;I recognized the little side scratch she's been doing. Simone 
                used to do it when she was trying on new clothes. It's from a 
                little plastic tee being left in the side of a bra when the tags 
                are taken off. If she'd have worn it around the house for five 
                minutes before she left she'd have noticed it and taken it out. 
                It's snowing out, so logically she'd have changed into something 
                warm before she left, but that would be long underwear or a tee-shirt 
                or something, not a new bra, so... The only reason she'd change 
                into a new bra before going out is if it's something she's been 
                saving. So...&quot;<p>
                &quot;How did you know about the grate, earlier?&quot; Cindy asked, 
                fascinated in spite of herself.<p>
                &quot;A half inch wrench is too small for anyone to ever bring 
                one as a weapon.&quot; Corey said. &quot;The simplest remaining 
                answer is probably true. Therefore, you probably broke in by unbolting 
                a window grate. But let's not get off the subject.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You changed into your sexiest under things? For Corey?&quot; 
                Amanda asked. &quot;You never even told me you liked him, before.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well,&quot; Cindy told her with downcast eyes, &quot;I knew 
                there was a small chance you two wouldn't get along, so...&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well that's okay Cindy!&quot; Amanda exclaimed. &quot;I 
                want him so much, I don't see how any girl could not want him. 
                You don't have to feel bad about that!&quot;<p>
                &quot;It's more serious than that.&quot; Corey said.<p>
                &quot;Please don't, Corey. You'll spoil everything...&quot; Cindy 
                pleaded.<p>
                &quot;Come on Cindy, if you don't tell her, she'll figure it out 
                one day, and then how will she feel?&quot; Corey asked. The silence 
                stretched.<p>
                &quot;What? What?&quot; Amanda pleaded.<p>
                &quot;Just say it to me then, Cindy.&quot; Corey told her. &quot;Come 
                on. Tell me.&quot;<p>
                Cindy couldn't tear her gaze away from his. Finally, almost against 
                her will, she spoke the words.<p>
                &quot;I love you, Corey Michaels.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Whoa. You love him? You're in love with him? Are you sure?&quot; 
                Amanda asked in amazement.<p>
                &quot;She's sure.&quot; Corey assured her. &quot;As sure as you 
                are. I can see now, that after the months you've both spent thinking 
                about me, that neither of you are going to feel any less for me 
                in a month unless I treat you like shit between now and then, 
                and I'm not going to. Look girls, this is not a healthy situation 
                at all. Someone's going to be hurt here today, maybe all of us. 
                Your family is mandatory; you'll always be each other's sister 
                for the rest of your lives. Matings are optional, there'll always 
                be other men for beautiful girls like you, and I refuse to have 
                it on my conscience that I ruined your relationship. I think the 
                best thing would be for you two to stay here in Spokane and I'll 
                move on.&quot;<p>
                &quot;No! No!&quot; both girls protested at once. They looked 
                at each other.<p>
                &quot;You've gotta have him, Cindy. I love you too much, and I 
                owe you too much, to come between you and the man you love. I 
                know you'd never let yourself be sure if you weren't also sure 
                that he'd love you back. Besides, he likes you. I could feel it 
                when you threw your coat off.&quot; Amanda told her.<p>
                &quot;You silly little fool.&quot; Cindy said, touching Amanda's 
                cheek. &quot;You'd really do that for me. But think about yourself 
                for the last two months. You can't work or go to school or anything 
                unless it helps bring you closer to Corey. Let's face it, Amanda, 
                you need to make it work with him, or you'll need some serious 
                therapy. If I left town with him and left you here, you'd just 
                sit at home and masturbate to his videos till you starved. My 
                god, Amanda, he's inside you right now! You're having sex with 
                him right now! You got him to make some sort of commitment to 
                you within six hours of meeting you, and it's already done! Besides, 
                Corey doesn't even know me. I'll get over it, and you know I'll 
                have other guys. If it weren't for him, I'd have never let you 
                know I felt like this in the first place.&quot;<p>
                They were silent for a few moments, then Amanda asked Cindy;<p>
                &quot;Out of all the guys you've had, Cindy, were you ever in 
                love before?&quot; When Cindy only bowed her head and couldn't 
                answer, Amanda answered for her.<p>
                &quot;No you weren't. I told him everything, all the important 
                stuff at least. So he does have a good idea what you're like. 
                But you're right; I can't give him up. I guess I'm just cursed, 
                because I can't feel good about having him when he's the only 
                man you ever loved.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Oh yes you can!&quot; Cindy reassured her. &quot;You guys 
                are gonna be great, and you know it! Just wait till he licks you 
                between your legs again, you'll forget all about my problems.&quot;<p>
                There was silence for another few moments.<p>
                &quot;No I won't.&quot; Amanda finally said. &quot;We're going 
                to have to share him.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Oh, come on, Amanda!&quot; Cindy burst out. &quot;That could 
                never work! Wake up to the real world!&quot;<p>
                &quot;Why not? You've been the only person that loved me for the 
                last four years.&quot; Amanda pointed out. &quot;I love you more 
                than anything, enough that I'd give him to you, but you won't 
                take him from me. I love him, and you love him. If we can make 
                him feel good enough to love both of us, then we'll be fine! Come 
                on, Cindy, we've gotta try! It's the only way where none of us 
                has to be hurt by this!&quot;<p>
                &quot;You're nuts!&quot; Cindy shouted in exasperation. She turned 
                to Corey. &quot;Will you talk some sense into her please?!&quot;<p>
                Corey considered it. Long moments went by.<p>
                &quot;You're both right. Amanda's right in saying it's the only 
                way where none of us has to hurt. Cindy's right in that it almost 
                never works, and most of the time the people who try end up pretty 
                shattered. Most of the time, jealousy is what goes wrong. Almost 
                all humans are naturally monogamous, and the more you care for 
                someone, the more it usually hurts to see them in the arms of 
                someone else. There's a lot of three-ways and more in Muslim countries, 
                but I'm convinced that almost every single one of those women 
                want to have their own husbands. I've met hundreds of thousands 
                of people in the last few years, and I've only seen three healthy, 
                stable relationships with three people. I knew these two guys 
                who were models, and they were a gay couple. They were good friends 
                with a girl who was a photographer's assistant, and one night 
                they were hanging around drinking together, and she bet them a 
                thousand dollars that if they gave it an open-minded try she could 
                convert them both back to being straight in one night. Now the 
                three of them have been together for over four years, and every 
                time I see them they joke that she's still trying to convince 
                them.<p>
                &quot;Another example is these two girls in Chicago who were inseparable 
                best friends. They did everything together, told each other all 
                their secrets, spent all their time together. You know the type. 
                Anyway, they realized that whenever one or both of them had boyfriends, 
                they hardly saw each other, and they realized that eventually 
                they'd probably both get married, have kids, maybe move away, 
                and not be able to spend much time together. So they made this 
                pact, and spent almost a year searching for the right guy, and 
                when they found him, they took him home and banged his brains 
                out, and now they have three kids, two by one girl and one by 
                the other. He's simply ecstatic, and they're among the happiest 
                people I know.<p>
                &quot;And there was this trio I met in New York once. The man 
                and his wife really loved each other, but they were really bad 
                at communicating, so they were always having these really ugly 
                arguments about stupid, trivial stuff. They finally broke up, 
                and the wife moved in with her girlfriend. The girlfriend seduced 
                her one night, and they did the girl-girl love thing for a couple 
                of months. One night he comes over for dinner and tries to patch 
                things up with his wife. Everything goes fine for a couple of 
                hours, and then they get into another stupid fight. The girlfriend 
                can't stand to see the wife hurting, and she's a really excellent 
                communicator, so she does some moderating, and patches it up between 
                them. They end up sharing a group hug, then a group kiss, then 
                group sex. It's funny, because now they're all great friends and 
                they all sleep together, and the wife loves the husband and the 
                girlfriend, and they love her. But the husband and the girlfriend 
                aren't in love with each other. On the other hand, the husband 
                and the wife almost never speak to each other, they both just 
                talk to the girlfriend, and communicate with each other through 
                her.<p>
                &quot;Anyway, the point is that it might work, but probably not, 
                and we're really playing with fire here. If we try this and it 
                doesn't work, we're going to hurt a hundred times more than if 
                I simply left. I'm like most guys in that I'd love to be with 
                two girls, any time, but I'm not the critical factor here. You 
                two would have to be committed to caring for each other more than 
                you care for me. When you walk into a room and see me making love 
                to her, you'd have to feel a little jealous at having to share 
                her with me. If either of you cared more for me than for each 
                other, I think it would drive you two apart.&quot;<p>
                There was silence for a moment. Finally Amanda turned to Cindy, 
                and said; &quot;I love you enough that I'd give him up for you, 
                Cindy. You love me enough that you are giving him up for me. I'm 
                making love to him now. Are you jealous of me?&quot;<p>
                &quot;No!&quot; Cindy insisted. &quot;You two belong together! 
                This is ridiculous, I'm leaving!&quot; But Amanda's hand on her 
                shoulder was all it took to hold her where she was.<p>
                &quot;I need you to kiss him, Cindy. I need to know if it makes 
                me jealous to see that.&quot; But Cindy only shook her head and 
                lowered her eyes. Amanda threw her leg over Corey so that she 
                was facing him again, and turned Cindy to face him as well.<p>
                &quot;Look at him, Cindy. Isn't he beautiful? You must want to 
                kiss him. If you've fallen in love with him, you must want to 
                do at least that with him. C'mon. Just lean over and give him 
                a little kiss, just so I know how it makes me feel. Please? For 
                me?&quot;<p>
                The whole time she was saying this, Amanda pushed Cindy closer 
                and closer to Corey. When her face was about nine inches away 
                from Corey's Cindy closed her eyes and let Amanda slowly push 
                her into contact with him. When her lips were about a quarter 
                inch away Corey kissed her, as softly and as gently as he could, 
                just teasing her lips with his. Amanda leaned over to get a good 
                view. Cindy held still, her lips slightly parted, and let herself 
                be kissed by him. He began to make a little more contact, and 
                gently rubbed his mouth on hers as he kissed her. Finally, Cindy 
                moved her lips a little, then a little more, and ever so slowly, 
                she began to kiss him back. Her passion slowly grew over a three-minute 
                length of time till she was kissing him actively. Her arms slowly 
                rose until they were about to wrap around his head or neck, then 
                paused in mid-air, hovering two inches from touching him for a 
                full minute. Then her resistance crumbled, and she wrapped her 
                arms around his neck and kissed him hungrily, like she was starved 
                to death for the touch of him. She murmured into his mouth as 
                she kissed him: `I love you. I love you. I love you...'<p>
                &quot;Oh god, that looks so hot, I think I'm gonna cum!&quot; 
                Amanda whispered quietly. She rubbed herself a few times, and 
                had a nice little orgasm watching them kiss.<p>
                Corey was quickly reaching maximum rampancy, and began gently 
                thrusting inside Amanda. Sooner than he would have believed he 
                was on the verge of climaxing, and was losing his ability to concentrate 
                on kissing Cindy.<p>
                &quot;He's gonna cum inside me, Cindy.&quot; Amanda told her quietly. 
                &quot;How do you feel about that?&quot;<p>
                Cindy pulled back enough to watch his face, and gently caressed 
                it, watching the parade of emotion and expression on his face 
                as he began to climax inside her sister.<p>
                &quot;That's so beautiful.&quot; she whispered reverently. &quot;I 
                wish you were coming inside me. And now, I am lost.&quot;<p>
                &quot;The only thing you've lost is this stubborn battle to give 
                up all your happiness for my sake.&quot; Amanda told her firmly, 
                reaching forward to brush a strand of Corey's hair from his forehead. 
                &quot;Come on, Cindy, give it up. Take the happiness that's right 
                there in front of you. Kiss him some more; you know you want to. 
                And the next time he cums, it will be inside you. (Oh. It's pumping 
                into me. I just love how that feels.)&quot;<p>
                But Cindy just continued watching him and lightly caressing him 
                as his climax ran it's course. Amanda felt a little piqued, so 
                she leaned over and kissed him herself as he finished climaxing, 
                kissed him as deeply and as well as she could, her tongue alive 
                inside his mouth. Just before she broke the kiss she looked at 
                Cindy out of the corner of her eye, and found Cindy was smiling 
                gently at her.<p>
                &quot;Corey, can I take it out of me now? I really have to go. 
                And the bathroom has a bidet. I've always wanted to try one, and 
                I'll never need to more than now.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yah, I have to go too.&quot; he told her as he caught his 
                breath. &quot;But just let me savor one more minute, the very 
                last minute of taking your virginity.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Wow&quot; Cindy said quietly. &quot;You're still losing 
                your virginity. That's...&quot; and she faltered, unable to find 
                words for how she felt.<p>
                He gently pumped it into Amanda a few more times, but he was finally 
                losing his hard-on, and when he was so soft that he just folded 
                up outside her instead of pushing into her he said:<p>
                &quot;Okay. That's all I can do for now.&quot;<p>
                Amanda slowly raised herself off him until his flaccid member 
                flopped against his belly, sticky and shiny with their juices. 
                Amanda immediately pressed one hand against her pussy, holding 
                her lips together to prevent all the liquid inside her from flooding 
                out onto him and the bed. She lay down on him and snuggled her 
                head into the hollow of his shoulder on the other side from Cindy.<p>
                &quot;Thank you for everything you've done for me, Corey. And 
                thank you for everything you've done for me, and for making this 
                possible, Cindy. I really hope you can find happiness with us. 
                I never thought I'd be this happy again, and I'm so glad you're 
                here.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Thank you for your virginity, Amanda. I'll always treasure 
                this memory.&quot; He turned to Cindy. &quot;And thank you. You 
                may be the most generous person I've ever met, and I really hope 
                you'll stay with us.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You're welcome, Corey.&quot; Amanda told him sweetly. She 
                climbed unsteadily from the bed, and made her way to the bathroom, 
                walking funny, one hand still pressed against herself. Over her 
                shoulder she said;<p>
                &quot;Why don't you clean him up a bit, Cindy. Use the cloth in 
                the blue bowl on the nightstand.&quot; Just before the door closed 
                behind her, they heard her mutter; &quot;Oh God, my pussy is so 
                sore...&quot;<p>
                There was a moment of somewhat strained silence, then Cindy glanced 
                at the bowl and asked him;<p>
                &quot;Can I?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Sure.&quot; He said, surprised at the shy hesitancy in her 
                voice. She took the cloth and wrung it out. She sat back down 
                on the bed beside him and looked at his naked maleness for a moment, 
                as if unable to decide how to start. Finally she spread the cloth 
                over her whole hand like she was too shy to touch it with her 
                bare skin, and gently began to clean him.<p>
                &quot;Mmmm, thank you.&quot; he murmured.<p>
                &quot;You like that?&quot; she asked.<p>
                &quot;It's very nice.&quot; he replied. They were silent for a 
                moment while she continued her ministrations. Then Corey asked; 
                &quot;What did she mean, that she tested me, and that I was balanced 
                on the line?&quot;<p>
                Cindy considered for a moment before replying;<p>
                &quot;Do you think Amanda's beautiful, or sexy?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Of course, both, how could I not?&quot; he replied, confused 
                by the apparent change of subject.<p>
                &quot;Why do you think she was still a virgin?&quot; Cindy asked, 
                never taking her eyes from his lower body. The question threw 
                him for a loop.<p>
                &quot;I, ah, I don't know.&quot; he stammered.<p>
                &quot;You really don't understand her much, do you?&quot; she 
                asked. He thought about it.<p>
                &quot;No, not much, but I'm trying to.&quot; he admitted.<p>
                &quot;Amanda's a very sexual person,&quot; Cindy explained, &quot;But 
                she can't help the fact that she wants to be dominated, and to 
                be hurt. Spanked I mean, although I'm afraid that if she isn't 
                very well cared for she'll begin to want even more dangerous things. 
                On the other hand she's very much afraid of being in an abusive 
                relationship, of being seriously hurt, or beaten to death. As 
                well she should be. Amanda realizes that she needs someone on 
                the line, and who's completely in control of himself. On one side 
                of the line are those who love to hurt people. On the other side 
                of the line are guys who take no pleasure in it or find it disgusting, 
                and she'd probably lose interest in a guy like that because he 
                won't give her what she wants. Right on the line are guys who 
                find it exciting but never do it because they recognize the danger, 
                or just don't want to be that kind of person. How did she test 
                you?&quot;<p>
                The question caught him off guard for a second.<p>
                &quot;She... she did this really submissive pose, and said `hurt 
                me master'.&quot; he finally stammered.<p>
                &quot;That would do it.&quot; Cindy stated. &quot;She was supposed 
                to be prepared to gouge your eyes and run, in case our estimates 
                of you turned out to be wrong. Was she?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Not really. It made me so mad I jumped up and grabbed her. 
                If I'd have wanted to hurt her, that would have been it. But you 
                know, she wasn't worried for a second.&quot; Corey said.<p>
                &quot;Well, she was pretty sure of you, and you passed with flying 
                colors, so I guess that's okay.&quot; Cindy said. Suddenly, she 
                turned and looked him right in the eyes.<p>
                &quot;I love her, and care for her very much, and I know she loves 
                and cares for me. We can love you because we know everything about 
                you, everything, and we know exactly what you're really like, 
                did you know that?&quot; she asked intensely.<p>
                &quot;Yes.&quot; he said.<p>
                &quot;And so far we've been right, you've been exactly what we 
                thought you'd be, right down to the surprising flashes of insight 
                everybody mentioned. But you don't know us, you don't understand 
                us, even though you have a rough idea. How can you say you'll 
                love us?&quot;<p>
                He was taken aback for a moment by her intensity, but soon collected 
                his thoughts.<p>
                &quot;Cindy, I really, really wish I could promise that I'll love 
                you both, but that wouldn't be right. All I can promise is that 
                I'll try to love you, and I can promise that I'll always treat 
                you well, with affection and respect. I didn't start any of this, 
                either with her or with you, and I don't know if I'd have chosen 
                to, but it's too late now, I'm going farther off the deep end 
                with every passing second. I just hope you girls take it easy 
                on me. I'm not indestructible either, you know.&quot; She kept 
                looking him in the eyes for another moment before she spoke.<p>
                &quot;Thank you, Corey. That's what I needed to hear you say. 
                But you still seem too eager to try to love me, considering we 
                just met a few minutes ago.&quot;<p>
                He thought about it for a few seconds.<p>
                &quot;Amanda showed me the note. From your dad. Because I made 
                her do it. She told me how you've been there for her since then. 
                I imagined how you two must've felt, going through all of that. 
                It really affected me.&quot;<p>
                She leaned forward until their lips met in a deep and gentle kiss. 
                While they were kissing she laid her bare hand on his manhood, 
                started to close her hand around it. He grasped her firmly by 
                the shoulders and pushed her away from him.<p>
                &quot;Please stop.&quot; he told her. She got a look on her face 
                like a little kid with her hand caught in the cookie jar, and 
                removed her hand from him with a jerk.<p>
                &quot;Hey, take it easy.&quot; he hastened to reassure her. &quot;It's 
                just that I desperately need to pee as soon as Amanda gets out 
                of the bathroom, and if you make me hard again I'm not going to 
                be able to. After that I hope we can explore each other, as long 
                as you and Amanda both feel comfortable with that. In the meantime, 
                there's a few things I'd like to ask you, if it's okay.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Oh. Okay. Sure, go ahead.&quot; Cindy told him, re-collecting 
                herself.<p>
                &quot;How did you get everyone I knew to talk to you about me? 
                Amanda told me you even got all my old girlfriends to discuss 
                our sexual relationships. I'm still friends with all of them, 
                except the ones I've lost contact with, and even they were all 
                friendly breakups. I don't understand why they would tell anything 
                personal to a stranger.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well, I told some that I was conducting social psychology 
                research on the celebrity phenomenon in the industrialized world.&quot; 
                Cindy explained. &quot;I'd bump into them in public like it was 
                random, or show up on their doorstep like I was going door to 
                door. I had a clipboard full of case sheets that were stamped 
                `Confidential' and I made sure they saw me write them up anonymously, 
                as `subject 247', or whatever. I told them I didn't want them 
                to reveal any names, and that if they knew anyone who had become 
                famous, I'd like to know how that person was affected by it. They 
                were even loaded questions, almost an invitation for them to bitch 
                about how you'd become greedy or a snob or ignored them since 
                your success. But none of them ever did. They only had nice things 
                to say about you. Your name wasn't mentioned, but because I already 
                knew that they knew you, I could tell when it was you they were 
                talking about. Mind you, I wasted a bunch of time because many 
                of the people you know, know other famous people besides you.<p>
                &quot;For your girlfriends, I'd just bump into them in a laundromat 
                or something, and strike up a conversation about my actor boyfriend 
                whom I'd just left. I'd bitch about his lovemaking in detail, 
                and how inconsiderate he was, and how shitty he treated me, and 
                swear to never go out with another guy in show business ever again, 
                because they were all assholes. It was almost an engraved invitation 
                for them to say: `Hey, I know exactly what you mean, I used to 
                go out with this singer who was such a creep...'. And every single 
                one of them said, `Hey, you can't write off every single guy in 
                show business, I used to go out with this musician who was so 
                sweet...'. For a while I couldn't see how you could be so nice 
                and not be married already. But then I saw that you always picked 
                career and goal oriented women who weren't in a position to initiate 
                a permanent relationship at the time. You seem to have mastered 
                the art of the quality, six month relationship.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Huh. I never thought of it like that.&quot; Corey said. 
                &quot;I guess you're right though. And nobody caught on?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I'd change my appearance and my voice a little each time. 
                I used a lot of conversational things like that. Most people figure 
                it's okay to say anything about you to anyone, as long as they 
                don't say exactly who it is they're talking about. The only person 
                who saw through me was your mom. I went through my whole research 
                spiel. She just looked at me for a few seconds and said: `Now 
                tell me what you're really here for.' It took the wind out of 
                my sails, I can sure tell you that.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I'm not surprised.&quot; Corey said a bit smugly. &quot;I 
                could never put anything over on her for a second. What'd you 
                do?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I told her the truth, completely and immediately.&quot; 
                Cindy stated. &quot;When somebody is that sharp, I want them on 
                my side. Once she knew what I was really up to she brought me 
                in and set me down with a cup of tea and started to tell me all 
                about you. She's very, very proud of you, you know.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yah, I know. She'll sit and talk about me to anyone who'll 
                listen, for hours.&quot; Corey said with some embarrassment. &quot;So 
                what did she think of your investigation?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well, once she knew I didn't mean you any harm, she was 
                a great help. She let me have access to all her mementos of you, 
                and set up interviews with the rest of your family. She'd just 
                tell them: 'This girl wants to talk to you about Neil', and her 
                say-so was good enough for them. It's a good thing you grew up 
                in northern California; I couldn't have afforded to check you 
                out if you lived any farther away. We've gotten to be close friends, 
                your mom and me. I call her up more often than you do. She thinks 
                I'm a damn fool for setting you up with Amanda, though. For the 
                last couple of weeks she's been more than hinting that I should 
                try to get you for myself, because she thinks I'd be good for 
                you, but I just remind her that she's never met Amanda. She planted 
                the thought in my head, though, and I think she's the biggest 
                factor in why I fell in love with you. I even want to call you 
                Neil.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You want to call him what?&quot; Amanda asked, emerging 
                from the bathroom with a towel around her hips.<p>
                &quot;Oh. Listen, Amanda, I didn't tell you absolutely everything 
                about him.&quot; Cindy giggled as Amanda climbed onto the bed, 
                her naked breasts wiggling enticingly. &quot;For one thing, I'd 
                like you to meet Cornelius Sergei Mikhailovitch, known by his 
                nickname until the age of twenty one and to his immediate family, 
                as Neil.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Cornelius Sergei Mikhailovitch? No way!&quot; Amanda laughed. 
                &quot;Cornelius! That's hilarious!&quot;<p>
                &quot;Cornelius going to the bathroom.&quot; he mock-growled, 
                &quot;And that's still Corey to you, and don't you forget it. 
                Cindy, if you want to call me Neil, fine, but not in public. I'll 
                be with you girls in a minute.&quot; he said, closing the bathroom 
                door behind him.<p>
                &quot;Well Cindy,&quot; Amanda asked with a grin, &quot;Is he, 
                or is he not, more delicious than you bargained for?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Mmm, he sure is.&quot; Cindy agreed. Then she took both 
                of Amanda's hands in hers and asked her earnestly; &quot;Are we 
                sure we want to do this Amanda? Doesn't it strike you as strange 
                that you're asking me to share your relationship with him? I mean, 
                I'm starting to get so hopeful, but I'm so afraid of being ridiculed 
                for being in some kind of a three way relationship, and I'm so 
                afraid of what will happen to us if this doesn't work.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I really want this, Cindy.&quot; Amanda stated earnestly. 
                &quot;It feels so right to me, and I like the idea better all 
                the time. I never thought about the possibility of hurting you 
                by leaving you here alone, and up till now I never thought about 
                how much I'd hurt to not be around you much any more. You've been 
                my whole family, and the biggest part of my personal life for 
                four years, and I don't want to lose that.<p>
                &quot;Corey seems okay with it, and he's risking more than us. 
                If we mess up his image with the fans, he could lose millions 
                in record sales. I'm not saying we should hide it if we do this, 
                but we should be discreet, and not volunteer it to the media. 
                And besides, when you kissed Corey, wow! That was the sexiest 
                thing I ever saw!&quot;<p>
                Cindy closed her eyes, thoughtful and pensive.<p>
                &quot;Just think about it, okay? No need to make any decisions 
                right this second.&quot; Amanda said. Suddenly she bounced off 
                the bed, and headed for the fridge behind the bar. <p>
                &quot;Am I ever starved! And I bet Corey is too!&quot; She grabbed 
                an empty ice bucket from under the bar and opened the fridge.<p>
                &quot;What've we got?&quot; She asked aloud, grabbing a few items 
                and tossing them in the bucket. She put a quart of milk under 
                the arm with the bucket, grabbed a quart of apple juice in her 
                other hand, and closed the fridge with her toe.<p>
                &quot;Hey, there's some fruit an stuff here too.&quot; Cindy called, 
                indicating the tray on the nightstand. She had removed the towel 
                that had hid the items on the tray that hadn't been used the night 
                before, revealing a bowl that had been fruit on ice and was now 
                merely fruit in cold water, including light grapes, cherries, 
                mandarin oranges, and half a cantaloupe; an unopened can of smoked 
                oysters and another of baby shrimp; a package of stoned wheat 
                crackers, and a handful of Belgian milk chocolates. Also, there 
                was bottle of aromatic massage oil, a tube of clear gel lubricant, 
                a paring knife, and a mickey of vodka.<p>
                &quot;He likes to be prepared, doesn't he?&quot; Amanda commented 
                to Cindy with a smile as they considered the tray's contents.<p>
                &quot;I can sure go for a shot of this!&quot; Cindy said as she 
                unscrewed the vodka bottle and took a sip straight from the neck.<p>
                &quot;Hey, c'mon, you'll spoil your breakfast!&quot; Amanda chided. 
                Just then Corey emerged from the bathroom, wearing another towel 
                around his waist.<p>
                &quot;Look at that, Cindy. That's exactly how he looked when I 
                first saw him here last night.&quot; Amanda pointed out. They 
                watched him walk across the room, and he watched them watching 
                him. For some reason their open appraisal of him a made him a 
                little embarrassed, and he smiled and blushed a little.<p>
                &quot;I've got some breakfast here if you're hungry, Corey.&quot; 
                Amanda said, setting the ice bucket and liquids on the tray and 
                the tray in the center of the bed.<p>
                &quot;Hey thanks, I'm starved!&quot; He exclaimed. They all sat 
                cross-legged around the tray and dug in. In the ice bucket Amanda 
                had a hoagie, a submarine sandwich, a tub of cream cheese, four 
                small tubs of strawberry yogurt, and a plastic envelope of carrot 
                sticks. Corey wolfed down the sub and the hoagie, and they shared 
                the remaining items about equally. No one spoke for ten minutes 
                as they ate, till their appetites began to be sated. Finally Amanda 
                turned to Cindy;<p>
                &quot;Well Cindy, you're starting to make me a little uncomfortable.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Hmf?&quot; Cindy asked around a mouthful of carrot sticks 
                and cream cheese.<p>
                &quot;Well, here's me and Corey practically naked, and there you 
                are covered up from head to foot. That doesn't seem fair, now 
                does it? Aren't you going to show us your sexy new underwear?&quot;<p>
                Cindy paused, then wiped her mouth with a napkin while she glanced 
                from Amanda's to Corey's face. She started to slide off the bed, 
                but then scooped a dollop of cream cheese out with her finger, 
                and very deliberately stuck it to Amanda's left breast, on the 
                top side of her nipple.<p>
                &quot;Oooh, that's cold!&quot; Amanda exclaimed. Corey and Cindy 
                watched as she slowly and sensuously cupped the underside of her 
                breast with her right hand and lifted while she bent her head. 
                She lifted her nipple to her mouth and lightly sucked the creamy 
                foodstuff off her breast's rapidly erecting peak. She left a layer 
                of it still there, and left it smeared over her lips while she 
                looked up and met Cindy's eye. She held her sister's gaze as she 
                sensuously swirled the mouthful around with a mischievous smile. 
                She leaned back on her hands and raised her bosom proudly.<p>
                &quot;There's still a little left, Cindy.&quot; murmured Amanda. 
                &quot;Do you want it?&quot;<p>
                &quot;You're impossible, Amanda.&quot; Cindy said with a smile 
                as she slid off the bed. &quot;I have eight years sexual experience 
                and you lost your virginity last night, and yet you make me feel 
                like I'm the little sister and you're showing me the ropes.&quot; 
                <p>
                &quot;That's because I'm seducing you.&quot; Amanda told her softly. 
                &quot;I'll bet you've never been seduced by a girl before, so 
                in this area I'm just as experienced as you.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You're seducing me, are you?&quot; Cindy asked with a smile. 
                &quot;You find me attractive? Sexy?&quot; She undid the button 
                on her jeans and slowly slid the zipper down. Hooking a thumb 
                into either side of the waistband, she pushed them down to her 
                knees and gracefully stepped out of them, standing proudly in 
                her white sweater and sox and bright red panties. The front of 
                the panties were a tiny triangle of red lace flowers, and the 
                red satin spaghetti strings passed high over her hips. She turned 
                slowly around, revealing that the back was a slightly larger triangle 
                of red lace flowers that was cleverly seamed in the middle to 
                tuck into the crack of her ass.<p>
                &quot;Oh, I know you're sexy and attractive.&quot; Amanda re-assured 
                her. &quot;And I like touching you because you feel nice. But 
                I don't lust after you, if that's what you mean. I find the thought 
                of seducing you to be exciting because I might get you to do something 
                that you've never done before, but mostly because I know that 
                Corey will really love seeing it. I think it'll drive him completely 
                wild, and that really excites me.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well,&quot; Cindy mused as she drew the sweater slowly over 
                her head, &quot;I can think of a few dozen ways I'd rather use 
                to drive him wild, and you should take time to enjoy subtle things 
                before you move on to extreme things.&quot;<p>
                She dropped the sweater behind her and cut the plastic tee from 
                the side of her bra with the paring knife. She took a relaxed 
                pose with one leg slightly bent in front a bit. She began a subtle 
                motion, a barely detectable movement that was a hint of dance 
                and a touch of sex and a bit of facial expression. Nonetheless, 
                it conveyed a complete understanding of what every man finds desirable 
                in a woman. Her tiny bra was only a completely transparent pair 
                of red nylon triangles, outlined by the same quarter inch wide 
                red lace flowers connected edge to edge that made up the straps. 
                She had breasts that fashion designers would refer to as `classic 
                B cup', and her straight blond hair shimmered in tiny waves down 
                her back. She closed her eyes and leaned her head slowly back, 
                inhaled deeply and barely licked her lips.<p>
                Corey had to reach down and adjust himself.<p>
                &quot;She really has a point about this subtlety thing.&quot; 
                Corey remarked in a low voice as he cleared his throat.<p>
                &quot;Doesn't she?&quot; Amanda returned with a smile. &quot;Yah 
                wanna get this while it's fresh, Corey?&quot; He leaned over and 
                quickly sucked the remaining cream cheese from her breast while 
                she licked her lips. They shared a quick smile and returned their 
                attention to Cindy, who was slowly beginning to rotate, bringing 
                her lovely behind into view.<p>
                When she had gone all the way around, she climbed onto the bed 
                and gracefully crawled toward Corey, her movement so smooth he 
                couldn't feel it in the bed. When she reached him she softly laid 
                her palm on the inside of his knee, and gradually slid her hand 
                up his leg, out of sight under the towel. She cupped and caressed 
                his balls so smoothly it felt like her hand had flowed around 
                him. Suddenly, he found he was breathing hard, and sweat was forming 
                on his brow. She withdrew her hand from the towel and held her 
                body softly against his, barely touching from breast to hip. She 
                moved around him till she was behind his right shoulder, and trailed 
                soft kisses over his shoulder and along his neck. Reaching under 
                his arms to rub his chest and hold his back against her nylon-coated 
                nipples, she gently encouraged him to lean back against her. When 
                he did, she laid him back on the bed beside her, trailing her 
                subtle kisses down his chest and stomach. By the time he was all 
                the way back she had reached the towel. Drawing back to watch, 
                she slowly untied the knot and folded back the ends like she was 
                unwrapping a treasure recovered from ages lost. He was so hard 
                that it didn't lay on his stomach though he was on his back. Rather, 
                it hung pulsing a quarter inch above his belly. She smiled at 
                it, and lay down on him diagonally across his right arm with her 
                chin resting on his belly, just close enough that she could reach 
                out with her lips and kiss his opening. She began rubbing it firmly 
                from head to root with her open hand, and murmuring something 
                so softly he couldn't make out what she was saying. It reminded 
                him of something and he couldn't place what it was, but it became 
                obvious when she lightly scratched it just under the head.<p>
                `Wow, that's too weird,' he thought. `Like cuddling with a puppy.'<p>
                The concept became unignorable when Amanda quietly commented; 
                &quot;Aw, isn't he cute!&quot;<p>
                He couldn't help but state in a low voice; &quot;Now that's kinda 
                out there.&quot; Both girls checked his expression to find him 
                grinning back at them, and smiled.<p>
                &quot;Hush, you big bully!&quot; Cindy scolded him softly. &quot;You'll 
                hurt his feelings.&quot; she turned back to his maleness and smiled 
                at it. &quot;Besides, he likes it, don'tcha boy? And now he's 
                gonna get the special treat, aren't yah boy? You're gonna be a 
                real good boy for Cindy aren't you? Huh? Do yah want the special 
                treat? Huh? Do yah? Okay, here yah go!&quot;<p>
                She placed both hands flat against his hips and gently kissed 
                all over the head with little kisses. Then she closed her eyes 
                and rubbed her face up and down his shaft a few times. Finally 
                she licked her lips to wet them and kissed him right on the very 
                tip. She pushed her lips against him firmly, and very slowly opened 
                their circle as she pushed them over his head, her mouth flowing 
                warmly around him.<p>
                Eyes still closed, she began subtly nursing on it and caressing 
                the rim with her lips while she took a series of slow deep breaths 
                through her nose. Then she held her breath and continued pushing 
                her lips slowly down his shaft. When she had about five inches 
                of him in she seemed to have reached a constriction in her throat. 
                She paused, moved her head a little to approach him from a slightly 
                different angle, and tried again. Still unable to go any farther, 
                she pulled back till only the head was in her mouth, and took 
                a few deep breaths while laving his head with her tongue and applying 
                a gentle suction. She moved sideways a bit to be more aligned 
                atop his body and not have to bend his shaft as far to the side. 
                Holding another breath she started back down his shaft again, 
                and this time when she reached the place she had stopped before 
                she only slowed, didn't quite stop, and kept going ever so slowly 
                for another two inches, then paused. Her belly fluttered as she 
                controlled her natural reactions with a practiced application 
                of will power, then slid firmly down on him another inch.<p>
                &quot;Oh! Oh!&quot; Corey breathed tensely, amazement at both 
                the sight and the sensation plain on his face.<p>
                &quot;Wow! That's impossible!&quot; Amanda exclaimed quietly.<p>
                Cindy held there for another thirty seconds, then pulled back 
                for another series of deep breaths through her nose. This time 
                she simply held his head in her mouth while she caught her breath, 
                then gradually descended upon him again. She was barely moving 
                when she got to the last two inches, yet still she continued till 
                her chin and lower lip were pressed hard into the hair over his 
                pubic bone. Her jaws were open so far they ached, even her lips 
                were stretched a bit around his base, and she knew she'd have 
                never got him down her throat if he'd been the tiniest bit larger.<p>
                Corey and Amanda could only stare incredulously. Cindy lifted 
                two inches, descended, lifted, descended, drew all the way back 
                till she was barely kissing the little slit in the end of his 
                dick, and smoothly descended till she was pressed hard against 
                him, the tip of her nose against his scrotum. She did it again, 
                all the way out and back down, a little faster this time. Finally 
                she drew all the way back and softly said to him;<p>
                &quot;I love you Corey. You can put your hands on my head and 
                guide me, but be gentle. I'll tap you when I need to breathe.&quot; 
                She drew three deep breaths through her mouth and took him all 
                the way down one more time, then pulled back about three inches 
                and held. He lightly caressed her pantied little bum, her back, 
                her neck. Her hair was fine and soft, like gossamer. Holding her 
                head very lightly with both hands he softly and experimentally 
                pushed the rest of his manhood into her mouth. She accepted it 
                almost effortlessly, maintaining a moist sucking, a slippery pressure 
                upon him everywhere. Holding her head a little more firmly, he 
                drew out about seven inches and slid it back in, and groaned deeply. 
                He bobbed the last inch out and in a few times, and got that impending 
                feeling. He drew his hands back from her head.<p>
                She pulled back off him and whispered; &quot;It's okay. You can 
                go all the way in me.&quot;, and slid her pretty mouth down his 
                pole again. His breath caught in his throat, and his voice was 
                ragged as an almost whining moan of pure joyful anticipation escaped 
                him. He took firm hold of her head and began stroking it into 
                her mouth steadily, and he began to shake. He was absolutely mind-blown 
                by the talented and skilled display of sensuous oral loving Cindy 
                was giving him. Amanda was also flabbergasted by what she was 
                seeing. She reached out and lightly stroked Cindy's throat, stunned 
                in amazement at the sight and feel of his throbbing largeness 
                sliding completely into her mouth and down her throat. Cindy tapped 
                his stomach lightly three times with her open hand, and he forced 
                himself to release her, holding his arms up shakily as if in surrender. 
                Cindy pulled back till her lips were just past his head. She sucked 
                on him fairly hard, and rubbed her mouth and tongue all over his 
                dickhead as she caught her breath through her nose. He'd have 
                come right then and there, except that he was distracted by the 
                sounds Amanda was making.<p>
                Amanda sat beside him on his left, cross-legged Indian style with 
                both hands busy between her legs, her tense face held less than 
                a foot from Cindy's, captivated. Her excitement was obvious in 
                her voice and her breathing. Corey and Cindy spared her a long 
                glance before Cindy renewed her envelopment of his manhood, recapturing 
                his full attention.<p>
                She held with most of his length in her mouth, and he resumed 
                his firm grip on her head. He stroked most of his length into 
                her mouth several times, and his orgasm jumped on him by surprise. 
                His whole body spasmed and he rose onto his heels and shoulder 
                blades. He seemed to fight for breath as he held himself inside 
                her all the way as hard as he dared for three pumps of his fluid, 
                then began a series of steady one inch thrusts. Out an inch, then 
                back in with a little pressure at the end, while his body wracked 
                it's way to ecstasy. It seemed to affect Cindy not at all, that 
                far down her throat his cock was delivering dose after dose of 
                his liquid into her body. Though it sometimes seemed to Amanda 
                that Cindy's lips might be bruised by the force with which Corey 
                held them against his body, Cindy only stroked his balls calmly 
                and affectionately with one hand as his climax ran it's course. 
                Finally he was only stroking his little thrusts into her mouth 
                occasionally as he rode the exquisite sensitivity of the afterglow.<p>
                Then she did something that brought his amazement to a new high 
                point. She swallowed. A wave of constriction passed from his root 
                to his head. It squeezed him so hard that he grunted and curled 
                up around her head, his knees raised high and his abs flexed hard. 
                She did it again and he yelped and whined like a puppy, shaking 
                like a leaf. She did it a third time and he let out a yell that 
                was almost a scream and recoiled from her, his back arched hard 
                and his hands tangling in the sheets. She began swallowing continuously, 
                and he dissolved into helpless convulsions as the waves of pressure 
                and friction running continuously down his length drove him into 
                overload. She grasped him on the back of his thighs to hold herself 
                in place as he thrashed, her swallowing squeezing him hard enough 
                to be on the sweet verge of pain. He regained enough control that 
                he could put a hand on the back of her head and hold her to him 
                firmly in a vain reflex to hold her still, and she continued her 
                relentless stimulation of him while he stared wide eyed and mindlessly 
                at the ceiling. Finally she stopped, and held still for long seconds, 
                just as Amanda's climax seized her body and she let herself fall 
                sideways on the bed, moaning and rubbing herself.<p>
                Cindy lightly slapped Corey's leg three times quickly and he removed 
                his hand from her head. She pulled herself off him completely 
                and immediately began panting like a steam engine through her 
                nose and mouth. Her face was crimson from pushing her ability 
                to hold her breath, and Corey realized she had held it for almost 
                three minutes. His dick still hovered a half inch above his belly, 
                shiny with her saliva, and it was Cindy's turn to be surprised. 
                She held three fingertips together and pressed them against the 
                very root of his cock by his anus. Still pressing firmly, she 
                slowly drew them up, sliding them between his balls and up the 
                length of his dick to squeeze the last dollop of his fluid from 
                him and into her waiting mouth. She sucked it off the end of his 
                cock and swirled it, and smiled.<p>
                &quot;Oooh, that looks so sexy!&quot; Amanda cooed. &quot;Does 
                it taste good? Can I have some Cindy? Please?&quot;<p>
                Cindy grinned at her. She crawled sensuously over Corey to where 
                Amanda's head was pillowed on her arm beside Corey. Throwing a 
                leg over Amanda she kneeled astride her belly. Leaning down and 
                holding Amanda's head firmly between both hands, Cindy kissed 
                her deeply and hard, sharing Corey's love liquid with her sister.<p>
                Amanda grabbed Cindy's wrists and accepted her kiss with surprise 
                at the sudden-ness of it. Then she was surprised at the fact that 
                Cindy had let Corey's come flow into her mouth, and then she was 
                surprised at the taste of it. It seemed vaguely familiar, and 
                then she placed her deja vu: it reminded her of the taste of her 
                own sexual secretions, and this similarity pleased her in a way 
                she could not define. She swallowed, and her thoughts took on 
                a deliciously naughty, talk-dirty kind of feel that was tremendously 
                exciting;<p>
                'I have Corey's come in my mouth, and I'm swallowing it.' Amanda 
                thought with a shiver. 'My sister Cindy gave it to me from her 
                mouth. She's kissing me... and... she's... very good at it, too.'<p>
                Cindy pulled back and smiled at Amanda from a few inches away.<p>
                &quot;Be careful what you wish for.&quot; Cindy whispered to her, 
                and gave her a little peck on the end of the nose. She rolled 
                off Amanda, lay on her back, and lifted her legs high in the air 
                with her toes pointed. She lifted her hips off the bed, and peeled 
                her tiny red panties off her behind, slowly drew them up her legs, 
                and off. Setting them aside she rolled over to hands and knees 
                and began crawling around Amanda toward Corey, looking him in 
                the eye with a smile.<p>
                &quot;Cindy, wait!&quot; Amanda said. &quot;Can we show it to 
                him first, please? You're so beautiful down there, I know he'd 
                like to see you show him.&quot;<p>
                As she asked she was coaxing Cindy into leaning back on her elbows 
                with guiding little pushes. Cindy blushed pink but allowed Amanda 
                to gently lean her back. <p>
                &quot;C'mere.&quot; Amanda said to Corey with a little hand wave. 
                He sat up and leaned forward to get a closer position beside Amanda 
                at Cindy's feet. Like unveiling an art work, she slid her hands 
                between Cindy's thighs and gently pushed her closed legs about 
                a third of the way open.<p>
                &quot;There.&quot; Amanda presented proudly. &quot;Isn't that 
                the prettiest one you've ever seen anywhere?&quot; Cindy blushed 
                crimson.<p>
                Her pubic hair was also light blond, almost white but with a touch 
                of yellow tones, and completely straight, without a hint of curl 
                or kink. It seemed like it stopped growing when it was an inch 
                long, and she kept it combed down smoothly over her mound. She 
                seemed to have as many pubic hairs per square inch as she had 
                on her head, but each one was extremely soft and fine, perhaps 
                as thick as her arm hairs were. Depending how the dim light reflected 
                off her delicate muff, it sometimes only seemed to be a semi-transparent 
                sheen. It's color was a delicious contrast to the bright, light 
                pink color of her nether lips, (about the same color as her tongue, 
                he thought), and the almost white light pink of her surrounding 
                skin. Her mound had a touch of plumpness, and as he watched the 
                very tip of her clitoris began to peek through, becoming just 
                visible.<p>
                &quot;You're right.&quot; he told Amanda. &quot;Perfection. Absolutely... 
                delicious.&quot; <p>
              </p>
