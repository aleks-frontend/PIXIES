          October 1995<p>
          Revised February 2002 </p>
        <p>Foreword</p>
        <p>This is the first story I ever wrote, not counting a couple of two-page 
          things I had to do for junior high school. I got it up to eight hundred 
          pages when I realized that it was still nowhere near finished, and that 
          it would be the first book of a trilogy. Now I'm re-writing it to give 
          it a bit of an ending and to move out some parts that should be in the 
          next book. I'll be posting it four chapters at a time as I get that 
          done. Be sure to read my other writings: Unthinkable and Almost Impossible 
          Dream, and please visit my website at<p>

        <p> Corey Michaels let himself into his deluxe dressing room in the Spokane 
          Civic Arena and threw himself into the overstuffed armchair. He ran 
          a hand through his hair and thought back on the concert he had just 
          performed.<p>
          &quot;Wow. My first sold out arena.&quot; he thought. &quot;Eighteen 
          thousand crazy screaming fans. I'm wiped. Am I ever glad they threw 
          in this totally cool dressing room. If you didn't know better, you'd 
          swear it was a suite in a hotel. I may just stay here tonight and skip 
          the drive back to the Sheraton.&quot;<p>
          He poured himself a screwdriver at the wet bar, threw back a healthy 
          swig, and headed for the shower. After undressing he stopped to appraise 
          his dark haired, handsome form in the bathroom's full-length mirror. 
          As always, he couldn't help feeling fortunate about the body that fate 
          had given him. Though he was twenty-eight his boyish face still looked 
          nineteen, and that helped sell albums in today's market. Still, he was 
          a huge man, whose six foot nine inch height and two hundred and fifty 
          pounds gave him a powerful physical presence in any room. He was well 
          muscled, and a touch on the slim side of average build for his height.<p>
          When he got out of the shower he tied a towel around himself, threw 
          another around his neck, and headed for the wet bar to top up his screwdriver. 
          After another healthy swig he stood there toweling his hair dry, when 
          he noticed the smell of perfume. Lifting the towel from his eyes and 
          looking around, he saw the girl standing by the door. <p>
          Petite and shapely, with long sandy blond curls, she looked about five 
          feet tall and sixteen years old. She wore black pointy toed ankle boots 
          with white sox, a black pleated mini-skirt and a black fashion jacket, 
          and was staring open-mouthed at his nearly naked body with rapt fascination. 
          She had obviously not expected to find him with nothing on but a towel, 
          and she looked like you could knock her over with a feather. He let 
          her look and finished drying his hair while he considered what her unexpected 
          presence signified. Settling the towel on his shoulders, he glanced 
          over at her and took a sip of his drink.<p>
          &quot;How did you get in here?&quot; he asked in a conversational tone 
          of voice. &quot;I'm supposed to have two security guys in the hall, 
          and I know the door was locked.&quot;<p>
          This seemed to snap her attention back to her present situation. She 
          was suddenly very nervous, twisting her hands and looking down before 
          answering.<p>
          &quot;If I tell you, will you let me stay?&quot; she asked softly.<p>
          &quot;If you don't tell me, I'll call the police.&quot; he calmly replied. 
          This brought a quick and shocked look at his face before she again looked 
          at her feet, and a rush of words in reply.<p>
          &quot;I work in the snack-bar upstairs and I stole a janitor's master 
          key an' we waited till one guard went to the bathroom and my sister 
          distracted the other one so he'd throw her out and I let myself in with 
          the key. Please, please don't call the police!&quot; This last came 
          out in a choked and anguished voice, and it seemed to him that she was 
          going to cry.<p>
          &quot;All right. Just take it easy.&quot; He took another sip of his 
          drink while she sniffed a couple of times and visibly tried to pull 
          herself together.<p>
          &quot;I remember you from the record signing at the mall today.&quot; 
          he said thoughtfully. &quot;I signed your tee-shirt and gave you a big 
          hug. So tell me. What makes you risk arrest, and your job, to break 
          in here and see me again tonight?&quot;<p>
          With that she kicked off her boots and took a deep breath. As she spoke 
          she walked slowly toward him, slipping off her jacket, dropping it on 
          the floor behind her.<p>
          &quot;I came here tonight because I want you to make love to me.&quot; 
          she told him quietly as she gracefully closed the distance between them. 
          As she came closer he couldn't help but notice three things. One was 
          that she was wearing a really incredible perfume, Obsession or something, 
          that he could not ignore. The second was that she was truly beautiful, 
          with lightly tanned skin, delicate elvin features, a subtle touch of 
          make-up and crystal blue eyes. The third was that she was wearing what 
          looked to be a skintight t-shirt made of black panty hose, almost completely 
          transparent, and beneath that she had what were perhaps the most perfectly 
          shaped breasts he had ever seen. Full and round and amazingly firm, 
          the skin of her slim chest met their bottoms in a gentle curve without 
          hint of fold. They were what he would call medium sized, maybe a touch 
          on the small side of medium sized, but they looked medium-large on her 
          slight form. And her nipples were completely erect, though the room 
          was warm.<p>
          Now it was his turn to be captivated. He shook his head, and with conscious 
          effort tried to achieve some focus.<p>
          &quot;Look,&quot; he said, &quot;First, if you know anything about me, 
          you know I never sleep with my fans. Second, we don't know each other, 
          and have no way of knowing whether it would work out between us. And 
          third, I'm twenty eight years old, and I think I'm a little too old 
          for a girl your age.&quot;<p>
          She reached the bar and looked up into his face with a little smile 
          before steadying herself with one hand on the bar to remove her sox.<p>
          &quot;First,&quot; she said, in her sweet little voice, &quot;I know 
          you haven't dated anyone since that model left you for what's-his-name 
          from the tennis tour about three months ago. Second, I don't dream of 
          being in love with you, I dream of making love with you.&quot; She straightened, 
          and smiling for him again, began unbelting her skirt. &quot;Third, I'm 
          eighteen years old and have I.D. in my jacket to prove it, and in this 
          state that makes me a woman.&quot; Her skirt slid to the ground and 
          she turned almost halfway around while watching him over her shoulder. 
          What he thought was a sheer t-shirt was actually a body stocking. Like 
          a one-piece swimsuit with short sleeves, it had nothing covering her 
          behind, only a spaghetti string that disappeared down the line between 
          her cheeks.<p>
          'That,' he thought, 'is either the most perfect little ass I've ever 
          seen, or the littlest perfect ass I've ever seen.'<p>
          &quot;Fourth,&quot; she said, &quot;I've saved myself for you. I've 
          never been with a man before. And fifth,&quot; she said as she turned 
          to face him once again, &quot;I can see that you want me.&quot; And 
          with that she nodded to where his towel was rapidly becoming a tent 
          as his desire stirred his erection.<p>
          &quot;Wow.&quot; he said, then paused, &quot;You're really something.&quot; 
          He took her hands in his and looked into her eyes. &quot;What's your 
          name?&quot;<p>
          &quot;Amanda. Amanda Thomas.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Amanda. Well look Amanda, you really are very special, and you're 
          making it very difficult for me to be a gentleman about this, but you 
          really don't want me to be your first. I'm very big, and you're very 
          small, and I don't think you realize how much I would hurt you, even 
          if I tried very hard to be gentle. Let me give you a signed copy of 
          my C.D. and call you a cab, all right?&quot;<p>
          For a moment neither one spoke or moved. Then she said, &quot;Feel my 
          heart.&quot; She took his big right hand in both of her little ones 
          and pressed his palm against her chest, his thumb and index finger cupping 
          the underside of her left breast. He could feel her whole body was shaking, 
          and her heart beat like a trip-hammer. Still holding his hand in both 
          of hers she began rubbing his palm against her perfect little left tittie, 
          her nipple so hard it almost felt like it was scratching his palm through 
          the nylon.<p>
          &quot;For almost seven months I've had wet dreams about you every night, 
          Corey. Every night. For almost seven months it seems like I can't think 
          of anything when I'm awake except you making love to me. I've spent 
          every waking hour for the last two weeks trying to plan for tonight, 
          what to wear, what to say, how to get you to see me, how to get in here. 
          I know every girl hurts some the first time, it shouldn't make that 
          much difference that you're bigger than average.&quot;<p>
          Suddenly her nerve broke, and she threw her arms around his waist and 
          pressed herself against him. &quot;Please Corey, I'll do anything you 
          want,&quot; she begged, &quot;Just don't send me away! Oh God, please 
          Corey, please don't send me away!&quot;<p>
          And if all of that combined with the feel of her deliciously perky tits 
          rubbing against his belly weren't enough to get him hard as a rock, 
          after a moment she lifted her mouth and began to suck his right nipple.<p>
          As her warm wet mouth closed around it she licked it with the tip of 
          her tongue. A wave of pleasure passed through his body, and a dozen 
          thoughts and feelings passed through his mind. One was how much he'd 
          tried to avoid this situation, as he knew it was seldom a good idea 
          to get involved with someone when they had a hero worship thing for 
          you. Another was a strong feeling of power, as he realized that this 
          pretty young thing was probably quite serious about doing anything he 
          asked, and it bothered him that this feeling of power was a really intense 
          rush. For a moment he was afraid of what he might ask her to do. He 
          knew she was at her peak of sexual desirability, yet her small size 
          combined with the way she suckled at his nipple gave her a child-like 
          aspect that fired his passion and excited him like nothing he'd ever 
          experienced, and this troubled his conscience in a way he could not 
          identify.<p>
          Yet another part of his mind resented what she had done, and felt that 
          she had used his own feelings against him, to manipulate him into a 
          situation he would have otherwise avoided. This part of him wanted to 
          throw her down on the bed and hurt her little pussy with his cock, to 
          roughly penetrate her and revel in her pain, as punishment for her disregard 
          for his choices. And this bothered him most of all.<p>
          He stood there, locked in indecision, as she slowly squirmed her body 
          against his. He finally reached for her shoulders, to push her away 
          from him, but found that he could not. His hands began firmly rubbing 
          her shoulders and back, her head and the back of her neck, pressing 
          her body against his. Her full mane of sandy blond curls reached the 
          small of her back, and felt so luxurious. No mousse, gel, or hair spray, 
          just lots of soft, clean, beautiful hair. Soon he realized that the 
          towel was holding his dick down at a very uncomfortable angle, which 
          was rapidly becoming painful.<p>
          He grasped her shoulders and pushed her away from him, but she only 
          wrapped her arms around his waist even tighter.<p>
          &quot;Please, I've gotta move it.&quot; he said as he tried to peel 
          her off. She looked up into his eyes, and he looked down toward his 
          crotch. &quot;It hurts, I've gotta move it.&quot;<p>
          She followed his glance down. &quot;Oh.&quot; she said quietly, as understanding 
          dawned. She let him push her off to arms length, then she very quickly 
          reached out and unfolded the towel from where it was tucked in at his 
          waist. It dropped to the floor, freeing his cock, which sprang up to 
          full erection.<p>
          &quot;Ahhhh...&quot; the groan of relief forced itself from his throat. 
          His cock was as hard as it had ever been before, the head pulsing only 
          an inch and a half from his belly, the shaft almost parallel to his 
          flat and muscled torso, his circumcised skin stretched to it's limit 
          by the power of his swelling. She stood transfixed by it, his hands 
          still on her shoulders, as she realized just how big it really was. 
          A real nine inches long, she knew it must be thicker than her wrist. 
          She reached out and gently touched it, then softly wrapped her hand 
          around it, saw how far her fingertips were from touching her thumb. 
          His dick was so sensitive a shudder rippled through his body at the 
          contact. Her touch felt cool on his pulsing member for a moment, then 
          hot. She pulled it gently to the side a couple of inches and let go, 
          to see it immediately snap back to vertical, with hardly a vibration 
          as it centered itself.<p>
          &quot;Wow.&quot; she breathed, awestruck.<p>
          &quot;Think about it.&quot; He whispered quietly. &quot;Think about 
          how it'll feel inside you. Because if we keep going now, you can't turn 
          back. I don't think I'll be able to make myself stop. I've never been 
          with a girl who was a virgin, and I've never had anyone small like you 
          before. So I need you to make a conscious decision. And I need to hear 
          you say the words to me.&quot;<p>
          She stared at his dick for a moment more, and licked her lips, before 
          she straightened her shoulders beneath his hands like she was coming 
          to attention. She looked him straight in the eye, and spoke;<p>
          &quot;Corey, I know you've never gone out with a girl who was shorter 
          than five feet ten, and I hope you don't hold it against me that I'm 
          small. I know that I want you to do this for me more than I've ever 
          wanted anything in my life. If it hurts me, then I want you to hurt 
          me. I need you Corey, and I won't turn back on you. I won't ask you 
          to stop. You can do it to me any way you want.&quot;<p>
          He kept his hands on her shoulders and his gaze on her face; seeing 
          there the rebellious determination, the open desire, and complete adoration.<p>
          &quot;Alright, Amanda. We can do this. I still feel like I'm making 
          a mistake, but you've got me more excited than anything that's ever 
          happened to me. Feel my heart.&quot; With that he pulled her close, 
          held her head against his chest, her ear to his heart so that the beat 
          thundered in her ear.<p>
          &quot;Oh thank you Corey, thank you...&quot;<p>
          &quot;Shhhh.&quot; he said, embarrassed by her gratitude. &quot;Shhh.&quot;<p>
          He bent down to kiss her, and she lifted her face to his, a gentle brushing 
          of lips before she wrapped her arms around his neck, closed her eyes 
          and parted her lips. Her breath came fast into his mouth, she was almost 
          panting, and he was surprised that her breath had no smell, like pure 
          warm air. It made him curious how she would taste. He gently pressed 
          his open lips to hers and tentatively licked her teeth, the tip of her 
          tongue, under her tongue, seeking the moisture there. Sure enough, at 
          first she seemed totally tasteless, like pure water was the only liquid 
          her mouth had ever held. After a moment he realized that she did have 
          a subtle taste, like pure organic love, and he hungered for it. He thrust 
          his tongue deep into her mouth, as far as it would go, and for a second 
          she drew back from this, his first penetration of her. His tongue seemed 
          to fill her little mouth completely, and she was momentarily afraid 
          he would shove it right into her throat and choke her. When it didn't, 
          she began to suck on it, gently and slowly caressing it with her lips 
          and tongue like she imagined she would do when giving head.<p>
          He slowly slid his right hand down her nylon covered back and onto her 
          bare bum. As her attention shifted to his hand on her ass she held still, 
          only maintaining a light suck to keep his tongue all the way in her 
          mouth. He cupped and caressed her right cheek, squeezing the delightful 
          little orb, while lightly grinding the heel of his hand between her 
          cheeks until he was pressing the string against her tiny opening there. 
          Then he lightly stroked across until he was cupping her left cheek, 
          his fingertips lightly pressing into her crack. The tip of his ring 
          finger was now pressing the string against her anus. He pushed a little 
          harder with that fingertip, pushing a little of the string inside her. 
          She flinched a bit, then began pushing her bum back against his hand.<p>
          &quot;Wow.&quot; he thought. &quot;She's so responsive.&quot; He stroked 
          his palm around her hip, up and down once on her belly, then up and 
          all the way down to cup her nylon covered pussy. She shivered, her breath 
          coming fast through her nose. His three middle fingers by themselves 
          more than covered all of her delicate mound, from the top of her pubic 
          hair to where his middle fingertip pressed on her string covered bumhole. 
          He could feel the little snap that held the string to the front of the 
          crotch of her suit.<p>
          He realized that he was uncomfortable bending over this far to kiss 
          her, looking straight down, and that she was reaching up as high as 
          she could, standing on tiptoe, tilting her face back all the way. Slowly, 
          he dropped his right shoulder, slid his right arm behind her knees, 
          and picked her up, cradling her gently in his arms. She was so light 
          it was effortless to lift her. He straightened his back and turned from 
          side to side a bit to work the kinks out, while she squirmed against 
          him like she could fit herself even more closely against his chest, 
          or like she was rubbing her pussy against something that wasn't there. 
          Then she slowly ran her hands up the back of his neck, rubbed his head, 
          and began actively sucking his tongue again. This time she added something 
          new to her previous motions; a little tiny chewing action like a baby 
          at the nipple. This excited the hell out of him, and he held still and 
          let her do it, because he suddenly had to put all his will-power into 
          fighting down the overwhelming urge to slam his achingly hard maleness 
          into her now NOW NOW! He knew he had an incredible night ahead of him, 
          and he wanted to make it last as long as he could, and to savor every 
          moment.<p>
          He opened his eyes and watched her face as he slowly withdrew his tongue 
          from her mouth. She sucked a little harder, like she wanted to prevent 
          it's escape, and at the end she made a pleading little `Mmm' sound and 
          pursed her lips around the tip, to prolong the moment. <p>
          She lay back in his arms and settled her cheek against his shoulder 
          as he straightened up. Eyes still closed, her face a smile of contentment, 
          she had a shiver of pure joyful delight. She looked positively angelic.<p>
          'Wow.' he thought to himself in amazement, 'I'm really going to do this. 
          I can't believe this beautiful girl would just walk in here and ask 
          me to take her virginity. Ask me, hell, she begged me!'<p>
          He carried her over to the big comfy armchair and sat down in it. He 
          settled her in his lap and was content for the moment to just look at 
          her, so pretty, so trusting, snuggled into his lap like it belonged 
          to her. She murmured something into his chest, so softly he could barely 
          hear she had spoken.<p>
          &quot;What? &quot; he whispered.<p>
          &quot;I said I can't believe I'm in the arms of Corey Michaels.&quot; 
          She lifted her head and gazed into his eyes. &quot;That I'm here with 
          you. That we're going to... become mated. I've dreamed of this a thousand 
          times, but you're so much better than a dream.&quot;<p>
          &quot;C'mon,&quot; he said, &quot;Don't go giving me a swelled head.&quot; 
          he changed the subject; &quot;Where did you learn to kiss like that?&quot;<p>
          She blushed a little. &quot;I've never done that with anyone else, but 
          it was in my fantasies of you. Like the way I walked across the room 
          taking my jacket off. Like... like sucking your nipple.&quot; She seemed 
          to get a bit of a naughty thrill from saying the words, and she leaned 
          down a bit to take his nipple between her lips and give it a little 
          lick before she continued speaking. &quot;I pictured you picking me 
          up like you did, but I didn't think you'd carry me to an armchair and 
          hold me on your lap. I thought you'd carry me to the bed. And of course 
          I didn't think you'd be naked already.&quot; she giggled.<p>
          &quot;I just met you.&quot; he said. &quot;I feel like I should get 
          to know you at least a little before I just up an' have sex with you.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Just up an' have sex with me?&quot; she giggled.<p>
          &quot;What, you think my terminology is funny?&quot; he asked with a 
          smile. &quot;And you with `We're going to become mated'?&quot;<p>
          They shared a laugh.<p>
          &quot;I guess that does sound a little silly.&quot; she said bashfully. 
          &quot;As for getting to know me, I'm just a silly little college girl 
          who lives here in Spokane, who dreams of making love with you every 
          night.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Are you serious?&quot; he asked, &quot;I mean really? Every night?&quot;<p>
          She sat up, and knelt between his legs on the seat of the chair. She 
          held his face in her hands and looked him in the eyes. She spoke the 
          words one at a time.<p>
          &quot;Every. Single. Night.&quot;<p>
          She kissed him hard, thrusting her little tongue into his mouth, only 
          to withdraw it and nibble his lower lip, suddenly biting it just hard 
          enough to hurt and just as quickly releasing it. She kissed and licked 
          a line from his chin to his ear, then softly whispered, her breath tickling 
          his ear;<p>
          &quot;And when I'm dreaming of you, and I show you my naked body, I 
          do it like this.&quot; <p>
          She pushed herself back and stood on the floor in front of him, facing 
          him with her feet together. Watching his face the whole time, she slowly 
          reached between her legs with her thumb and forefinger and released 
          the little snap. Her bodysuit had been stretched to cover her, and he 
          heard the string in the back snap free from between her buns. She very 
          slowly gathered the front in both hands and raised it to just below 
          her breasts. She crossed her hands, and grasping the bottom edge again, 
          she pulled it just over her head and shook her hair free of the neck-hole. 
          She paused there, her hands behind her head, the bodysuit still around 
          her arms, and the rest of her body at attention; feet together, buns 
          tight, breasts held proudly high.<p>
          Her nudity hit him harder than he'd thought it would, considering that 
          the bodysuit basically didn't cover anything. Partially because the 
          pose she had paused in looked more than a little submissive; it almost 
          looked like her arms were tied behind her head, and partially because 
          her little pussy was completely bare. He'd known from the view through 
          the sheer nylon that she couldn't have had much pubic hair, but somehow 
          he hadn't expected her to have none. He reached out and gently brushed 
          his fingertips over her naked mound. It was completely smooth, and looked 
          like the pussy of a little girl. He frowned, and she saw the look cross 
          his face.<p>
          &quot;Does it bother you that I have no pubic hair?&quot; she asked.<p>
          &quot;It bothers me that you have no stubble.&quot; he replied. &quot;Are 
          you sure you're eighteen?&quot;<p>
          &quot;Is that all?&quot; she laughed, relieved. &quot;Yes, I'm very 
          sure I'm eighteen. I don't like my pubic hair, and stubble is itchy 
          after about ten hours, so I pluck it.&quot;<p>
          &quot;You pluck it? Doesn't it hurt?&quot;<p>
          &quot;Sure, but not as much as a bikini wax.&quot; she said with a smile.<p>
          &quot;Oh.&quot; He had no other reply to that, and continued to caress 
          her mound with his fingertips, fascinated in spite of himself. After 
          a minute she slowly drew her hands over her head in front of her and 
          let the bodysuit fall down her arms to her wrists. She twisted one hand 
          around so that it was tight around her wrists, bowed her head, relaxed 
          her arms and bent her knees a little. Suddenly she looked very submissive, 
          and her hands definitely looked tied in front of her. It was a look 
          that hit him so hard he could barely breathe. Then she said The Sentence. 
          She said it just loud enough for him to hear:<p>
          &quot;Hurt me, Master.&quot;<p>
          It seemed to take a moment for him to comprehend what she had said, 
          a moment for The Sentence to percolate down into the center of his brain, 
          and when it did, it exploded into anger.<p>
          In one motion he burst out of the chair, ripped the body stocking from 
          her wrists, and gathered her tightly into his arms, holding her with 
          her feet dangling far off the floor. He stood there, shaking with rage 
          and trembling with passion, and growled through clenched teeth into 
          her ear:<p>
          &quot;Don't DO that! Don't SAY that! Don't even THINK like that! DON'T 
          YOU REALIZE THAT I COULD REALLY HURT YOU?!!&quot;<p>
          He'd never felt anything like this. He was shocked, afraid, and confused 
          by the strength of his reaction. She began to whisper soothingly in 
          his ear.<p>
          &quot;It's okay. It's all right. I'm sorry. I won't say it again. Relax. 
          It's gonna be all right.&quot;<p>
          It didn't help. He had to fight off another wave of the overpowering 
          urge to throw her on the bed and fuck his cock into her tender little 
          pussy with all his force. When that passed, he almost gave in to another 
          powerful urge to squeeze the life out of her, and actually squeezed 
          her hard for a second, before he controlled himself. So there he stood, 
          every muscle flexed and jumping with unspent energy. She braced her 
          forearms against his chest, wrapped her legs around his waist, and whispered;<p>
          &quot;You can squeeze me. I'm in good shape, I won't break.&quot;<p>
          Desperate for an outlet, he hesitated, then laid his forearms along 
          each side of her back, his palms flat on her shoulder blades, and squeezed 
          her naked body to his with all his strength. Her breasts were crushed 
          against him, her hard nipples digging into his chest, and he growled 
          deep in his throat. She needed all the strength of her arms pushing 
          back against his chest to be able to breathe, but his force was distributed 
          over her whole back. He had no leverage, and as he hoped, he couldn't 
          hurt her with his arms in that position.<p>
          Soon his anger, and his arm strength, began to drain. As his grip relaxed 
          she began to kiss his face and run her hands through his hair, soothing 
          him with her voice.<p>
          &quot;I'm so sorry. I didn't know I would upset you like that. It's 
          all right. I won't do that again.&quot; <p>
          After a while he regained calmness, and was slowly rubbing his hands 
          against her back.<p>
          &quot;You're so strong.&quot; she whispered. &quot;To really feel your 
          strength like that, when you squeezed me, it really makes me turned 
          on.&quot; She rubbed her pussy against his belly a bit, and he could 
          feel the spot of moisture there.<p>
          &quot;I don't know what came over me.&quot; he said. &quot;I was so 
          angry. I was afraid I was going to hurt you real bad.&quot; Then a thought 
          struck him.<p>
          &quot;But you weren't.&quot; he said in amazement. &quot;You weren't 
          afraid for a second. How could you be so sure I wasn't going to really 
          hurt you?&quot;<p>
          She looked into his eyes. &quot;I knew.&quot; she said with absolute 
          seriousness. &quot;I trust you completely. More than you trust yourself. 
          I know you'd never do anything to harm me. Let me show you. Hold out 
          your hand with the palm up.&quot;<p>
          He transferred her weight to his right arm and held his left out as 
          she requested. She leaned over and lay back with his hand in the middle 
          of her back, eyes closed. He released her with his right, and she relaxed 
          completely, letting herself arch backward over his hand. Her arms and 
          legs hung out and down, head back, her hair brushing the floor. It was 
          easy for him to hold her weight in one hand. Then she struck a pose 
          like an upside-down swan dive, with feet together, fingers and toes 
          pointed, before settling back to relaxed, a position like a gymnast 
          doing a high back arch off the floor. She looked so beautiful, so vulnerable.<p>
          &quot;Where did you learn that, Amanda?&quot; he asked softly. She smiled 
          from where she hung with her head upside-down with her eyes closed, 
          and shook her head a little, sending waves rippling down her hair.<p>
          &quot;Figure skating. It's a sport where a girl has to learn to trust 
          a man with her life, 'cuz he's always lifting her over his head, throwing 
          her up, and catching her.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Hmm.&quot; He turned her a little so he could better see her naked 
          little pussy, so exposed in this position. She had a barely visible 
          bead of moisture along the verge of her slit, and the hood of her tiny 
          clitoris was just peeking through. He reached between her legs with 
          his free hand, touched his index fingertip to the base of her spine, 
          and slowly drew it up over her tailbone. When it slid between her buns 
          she shivered, but held still, while he traced the depths of the crack 
          of her ass until his fingertip was pressed against the bud of her anus, 
          then paused. He withdrew his finger till the tip was just touching her 
          crack, then slowly and deliberately wiped his fingertip along the surface 
          of her slit. When his fingertip brushed the tip of her clitoris she 
          let out a little yelp and shivered, harder this time, but she kept her 
          balance.<p>
          He was left with a round droplet of her moisture on his fingertip, clear 
          and a third of an inch wide. It looked like it should run down his finger, 
          but it didn't, it just clung there, so he knew it must be thicker than 
          most girls' lubrication. He licked it off his finger and swirled it 
          on his palette like fine wine, and discovered that it was thick, much 
          more a gel than a liquid, and that it had the same delicious taste as 
          her mouth, only more concentrated.<p>
          He slowly carried her over to the bed, and she remained draped backwards 
          over his hand, a little smile on her face, eyes closed, motionless except 
          for a slight sway of limbs and hair as he walked.<p>
          &quot;I'm going to set you on the bed.&quot;<p>
          When she heard that she smoothly contracted into a little ball, knees 
          clasped to chest, still balanced on her back in his hand. He cradled 
          her again in both arms, placed one knee on the edge of the king size 
          bed, reached out and set her in it's center. She stretched luxuriously 
          and relaxed with both arms over her head, as he lay beside her on his 
          left side, head in that hand. He gently cupped her left breast, squeezed 
          it a little, did the same with her right one, wiggled it a little, leaned 
          close and looked carefully for little lines.<p>
          &quot;Amazing.&quot; he breathed.<p>
          &quot;Do you like them?&quot; she asked.<p>
          &quot;They're the most perfect pair I've ever seen.&quot; he said. &quot;And 
          I know they're natural. Your body is incredible. You're so beautiful. 
          Being close to you is like being in a magic sexuality field that has 
          control of my mind.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Oooh, thank you.&quot; she preened. If a girl could glow with 
          pride she'd have lit up the room. She gave him a big smile and shook 
          her titties a little, from side to side.<p>
          He leaned over and opened his mouth wide like he was going to try to 
          take her whole tit in his mouth, but stopped just short of touching 
          her and slowly exhaled his warm breath over her nipple and areola. Just 
          as she was marveling at how hot his breath felt he pursed his lips and 
          blew a fast cooling stream over her nipple like he was blowing out birthday 
          candles. The sudden coolness gave her a shiver, and then he did lower 
          his mouth to her breast, and his wet touch seemed hot enough to burn 
          her, and just as she was getting used to that he blew another fast stream 
          on her nipple. It seemed to cool her skin three times as much as before 
          because her nipple and areola were wet now, an icy stream that made 
          her nipple try to reach a new level of stiffness. Then he fastened his 
          burning mouth around it again.<p>
          &quot;Oooh! That's good!&quot; she moaned. &quot;My nipples are so hard 
          they hurt.&quot; <p>
          He licked, nibbled and sucked first one, then the other succulent globe, 
          while his hand slowly slid down her belly to cup her pussy mound, his 
          middle fingertip again coming to rest against her bum hole. He kissed 
          his way over to her armpit and buried his face in it. Eyes closed, he 
          licked her armpit all over, reveling in the slight tastes of salt, fresh 
          sweat, and perfume, as well as the feel of her soft skin against his 
          face. At the same time he began to apply and release a firm pressure 
          against her smooth little twat, press, release, press, release. He kissed 
          his way up to her neck, nuzzled and kissed her there and in the hollow 
          of her shoulder, kissed his way up to her ear, and lightly nibbled it, 
          alternating with quick licks with the tip of his tongue.<p>
          He pressed his hand against her pussy and began to rub up and down with 
          short strokes. Her body opened beneath his hand, her pussy lips parting 
          as they released their moist cling to each other. His middle finger 
          was suddenly almost surrounded by her labia, her clitoris firm against 
          the inside of his first knuckle and the ball of his fingertip in her 
          opening. Curious, he pushed it a little farther and touched her maidenhead, 
          closer to the entrance to her vagina than he had suspected.<p>
          &quot;Wow.&quot; he breathed in wonderment. &quot;You really are a virgin!&quot;<p>
          &quot;Yes,&quot; she smiled and answered dreamily; &quot;I really, really, 
          am a virgin.&quot; and thought to herself: `But not for long!'<p>
          He flattened his fingers and continued his prior motion. Two more short 
          strokes and his hand was soaked in her juices.<p>
          She spread her legs, bent her knees, and placed the soles of her feet 
          flat on the bed. She grabbed a double handful of bedspread in her fists 
          and buried her face in the hollow of his shoulder. She began making 
          little grunts in time to his firm strokes on her loins: `Huh, huh, huh, 
          huh...'<p>
          &quot;Lift your knees and lay back.&quot; he told her. She lay her head 
          back on the bed and lifted her knees as high as she could towards her 
          shoulders, her heels against the back of her thighs with her toes pointed.<p>
          &quot;A little wider.&quot; he asked, and she opened her legs as wide 
          as she could while keeping her knees as high as she could.<p>
          &quot;All right, but keep your tailbone against the bed.&quot; She had 
          to lower her knees just a bit to do that, but found it much more comfortable 
          because she could relax her stomach muscles. All the private areas of 
          her body were now completely open to whatever he might do. He began 
          rubbing his hand in slow, growing circles until her whole ass, pussy, 
          belly, and the insides of her thighs were all shining and slippery with 
          her fluids. He marveled at the novelty of her smoothness, where his 
          hand expected to feel a springy muff of hair. He started alternating 
          between a circle centered on her clit, always just rubbing it with the 
          outside of his hand, and a long, straight rub from her belly button 
          over her pussy, over her ass to the small of her back, then back up 
          to her belly button. She hummed every time his hand rubbed her swollen 
          little clitoris; two short hums on the straight rubs and a long growing 
          one on the circle;<p>
          &quot;Mmm, mmm. HmmmMMMH! Mmm, mmm. HmmmMMMH! Mmm, mmm...&quot; <p>
          He knew that at this point she had no attention span left over to notice 
          him kissing her neck, so he leaned back to enjoy her facial expressions 
          as he continued the calculated friction on her pleasure zones. Her eyes 
          were completely wide open and her face almost looked a little frightened 
          as she began to lose control of her body. She noticed his head pull 
          back and watched him watching her, but she couldn't do anything about 
          her expressions or anything else, and soon forgot he was there as her 
          attention was captured by what her loins were feeling. After only six 
          or seven cycles of this treatment she could no longer contain herself. 
          She wrapped herself around his arm with her arms and legs as her orgasm 
          began, holding his bicep tight between her breasts, her ankles pushing 
          his hand against her clitoris, which she humped against his palm with 
          short strokes. Wails of pleasure and amazement were torn from her throat;<p>
          &quot;MmmaaaaaaaAAAAAAHHHHHH!&quot; He let her hump his hand for all 
          she was worth, sweat pouring off her body, her voice rising and falling 
          with each breath. It seemed to her that the orgasm spread from her clitoris 
          through her whole body before exploding in her mind, and went on and 
          on and on.<p>
          He could only stare in amazement as her body spasmed and her pussy contracted 
          against his hand.<p>
          &quot;I wonder,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;If she realizes how 
          hyper-sensitive she's going to be after this.&quot; Her climax finally 
          began to wind down, and he let her get down to aftershocks and final 
          twitches before he gave it to her again. She even began to speak.<p>
          &quot;My god, Corey, that was uunnggaaaaAAAAA!!&quot; He began rubbing 
          her super-sensitive little pleasure bud unmercifully. She locked back 
          onto his arm with everything she had, only this time she was trying 
          to stop him from rubbing her clit. He kept it up until she could stand 
          it with no more than mild squirming, almost three full minutes. He held 
          still for a minute while she got her breath back.<p>
          &quot;It's okay. You can let go now.&quot; he whispered to her. She 
          let go of his arm and relaxed with a groan, flopping back into an exhausted 
          looking spread-eagle.<p>
          &quot;Oh man, Corey.&quot; she murmured, staring blankly at the ceiling 
          as she re-lived what she had just experienced. &quot;Oh man.&quot; She 
          could think of nothing else to say.<p>
          He leaned over her face, kissed her slowly and gently, and lay there 
          a moment just smiling and looking down at her face. He began caressing 
          her delightful tits as he spoke;<p>
          &quot;I've never met a woman as responsive as you, Amanda. And I've 
          never had as much fun giving a woman an orgasm. Or been as exited by 
          it. Look at me.&quot; and he rolled onto his side so she could see his 
          manhood. To her it looked the same as it had since she'd first seen 
          it; totally hard, pointing at (and almost reaching) his belly button, 
          throbbing gently with his heartbeat.<p>
          She smiled. &quot;I'm only this responsive because I'm with you.&quot; 
          she told him shyly. &quot;I've cum before, when I was, you know, by 
          myself, mostly while thinking of you, but they were all real small compared 
          to that. And what you did after, I don't know if it made me come again...&quot;<p>
          &quot;It didn't,&quot; he interrupted, &quot;It was an amplified aftershock.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Well,&quot; she continued, &quot;Now I know there really is such 
          thing as: `more pleasure than you can stand'. It almost made me pee 
          on your hand. I don't know if I liked it.&quot; She paused, then hurriedly 
          added; &quot;But if you wanted to do it to me again, you could.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Amanda,&quot; he laughed, &quot;You are a classic.&quot;<p>
          She decided she'd take that as a compliment, and smiled for another 
          of his slow gentle kisses. As they broke the kiss she quietly asked;<p>
          &quot;In a way it felt better than anything except coming, but in a 
          way it was pure torture. Why did you do that to me, Corey?&quot;<p>
          He thought for a moment before answering.<p>
          &quot;I guess I wanted to blow your mind a little. I felt like you've 
          been pushing my buttons since you got here, and I wanted to regain control 
          of the situation.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Oh Corey, you can control me any time. I don't want to push your 
          buttons, I just wanted to bring you pleasure.&quot; She glanced down 
          at his hand where it was stroking her globes, lightly scratching her 
          areolas, and gently pinching her nipples. &quot;Like you're bringing 
          me pleasure right now. I can't believe that's making me this horny again 
          already.&quot; <p>
          &quot;You'd better be,&quot; He chuckled, &quot;That was barely an appetizer. 
          Do you need to use the girls room?&quot;<p>
          &quot;No, that's okay. It was just a momentary feeling.&quot;<p>
          &quot;Okay.&quot; he said. &quot;Don't move. I'll be right with you.&quot;<p>
          She watched his ass as he walked to the bathroom.<p>
          &quot;I can't believe it.&quot; she thought joyously to herself. &quot;I'm 
          actually lying naked on Corey Michaels' bed. He actually held me in 
          his arms, kissed me, touched me. Everywhere. He made me cum. I can't 
          believe I actually, really came on Corey Michaels' hand!&quot; She got 
          a chuckle from the mental picture of her college girlfriends seeing 
          her as she came, wrapped around Corey Michaels arm. Even if she could 
          tell them, they'd never believe it!<p>
          &quot;And in a few minutes, he's going to make love to me. I know he 
          is. He's going to put his big thing inside me. His big cock.&quot; She 
          got an embarrassed thrill from even thinking with words like that. She 
          made herself quietly say them out loud. &quot;He's going to fuck me 
          with his big, hard, cock.&quot; She shivered, and smiled.<p>
          Just then he came out of the bathroom carrying a tray with a few items 
          on it. He carried it behind the bar, and she watched his cock bob when 
          he walked. He was completely un-self-conscious about his nudity. She 
          couldn't see exactly what he was doing, but she could tell he was adding 
          items to the tray from the fridge and the cupboards behind the bar. 
          He dimmed the lights, carried the tray to the nightstand and took a 
          drink of the screwdriver on it. <p>
          &quot;Okay, sit up. Drink this.&quot; He handed her a tall glass, full 
          of an amber liquid. She began drinking without a moments' hesitation 
          or word of question. It was cold apple juice, and very refreshing. &quot;Now 
          drink this.&quot; It was a smaller glass of clear liquid that turned 
          out to be water. &quot;Now lay back like you were.&quot;<p>
          He took a large cloth from a bowl of warm water and wrung the excess 
          from it. He turned to where she lay, relaxed and spread-eagled in the 
          center of the bed, and gently washed her face, then her neck and shoulders. 
          Working his way down, and occasionally rinsing the cloth in the bowl, 
          He lifted her arms and washed all the way around them, then her breasts, 
          (kissing them while he washed them), her ribcage, and stomach. She held 
          perfectly still and luxuriated in the attention, afraid to break the 
          spell. He slowly washed every fold of her pussy and clit, and she had 
          a mild little orgasm, like she had at home. He wouldn't even have noticed 
          if it weren't for her sharp little intake of breath, but he did. He 
          just smiled and moved on to her legs, picking them up one at a time 
          to wash all the way around them, and then her feet. He had her roll 
          over then and bunch her hair on one side so he could get to the back 
          of her neck and her back, then he had her spread her legs a little and 
          gave special attention to her tiny bum. <p>
          When he was done he kissed her right cheek, then her left. He closed 
          his eyes and rubbed his face against them, all over, then pushed his 
          mouth right between them, wiggling it from side to side till he could 
          kiss her bum hole without puckering. Quickly, he pushed his tongue all 
          the way in her bum, having to push hard to spear it into her tight little 
          ring, and wiggled it wildly all around. This made her wiggle wildly, 
          and gasp, and when he pulled it out just as quickly she was left with 
          a strange, momentary empty feeling. He squeezed her buns together, pushed 
          the tip of his tongue into her vagina, and licked all the way up the 
          crack of her ass, reaching all the way into it and squeezing her cheeks 
          around his tongue. He did it again, down and up, and again. He released 
          her buns and pushed his face back into her now slick ass crack and rubbed 
          his whole face in it, side to side and up and down, from forehead to 
          chin and ear to ear.<p>
          He couldn't believe how great her ass felt against his face, so soft 
          and warm and smooth. He realized his clean-shaven facial skin was much 
          more sensitive to touch than his hands, and he got a sudden urge to 
          experience her whole body that way. He pushed her legs together and 
          rubbed his face down the cleft between them, dried himself on the backs 
          of her thighs, then worked his way back up for another round of rubbing 
          his face in her wet ass crack. He dried his face again on the outside 
          of her cheeks by her hips, and worked his way up her back till he was 
          nuzzling her neck and the hollow of her shoulder.<p>
          He grabbed two handfuls of her soft, curly hair and rubbed it on either 
          side of his face as he nuzzled her neck. Releasing her hair, he slowly 
          turned her over with a hand on her shoulder as he nuzzled around to 
          the hollow of her throat.<p>
          &quot;God, Corey, you're making me so hot, so hot...&quot; Her right 
          hand strayed to her pussy, and she began delicately rubbing her clitoris 
          with the tip of her index finger.<p>
          Eyes still closed, he rubbed his face down to the valley between her 
          breasts. He squeezed them around his face, they were so soft and plump 
          and round, then lifted his head, pressed them together, and rubbed his 
          face all over them. He rubbed his face down to her belly button, then 
          moved beside her and put one hand under her ass and one under her shoulder, 
          and made a little lifting motion. She got the hint, and tried to curl 
          herself completely around his head. In this position, simply by turning 
          his head he could rub his face over her breasts, across her chest and 
          belly, the front of her pubic mound and the front of her thighs, and 
          back again. After a few of those he just reveled for a moment in the 
          feel of her wrapped around his head. He relaxed his hands against her, 
          signaling her to lie back once more, legs together with one knee slightly 
          bent, her hands playing in his hair.<p>
          He moved back between her legs and looked her in the eye, smiled, licked 
          his lips and looked at her crotch. Her heart jumped as she realized 
          what he was going to do.<p>
          Expectation and excited apprehension were plain on her face, in every 
          line of her beautiful little body. She began to open her legs.<p>
          &quot;No.&quot; he said, pushing her knees together with his hands, 
          &quot;Not yet.&quot; He placed a hand on either side of her hips, settled 
          to his elbows, and gently kissed her mound. Holding the kiss, he settled 
          atop her tight together little legs, holding most of his weight on his 
          elbows and knees. He kissed all over her smooth little mound, looking 
          so much like that of a little girl, only fuller, rounder, swollen and 
          blushing with desire. Her hands returned to playing with his hair and 
          caressing his head as she watched him. He placed the tip of his tongue 
          against the top of her slit, pushed it down over her clitoris, and by 
          forcing his chin between her thighs, pushed his tongue right into her 
          vagina.<p>
          He loved the fact that she had the same great taste all over; her saliva, 
          her anus, her pussy juice, even her sweat was the same taste with salt. 
          She shuddered violently, and pushed his head against herself a little 
          harder. He licked back up to her clit, pushed his lips against her slit 
          and sucked her clitoris out of it. Holding it between his pursed lips 
          he lashed it quickly with the tip of his tongue 'till she squirmed and 
          whined, then released it and licked down and up her pussy again. He 
          did a push-up and said;<p>
          &quot;Lift your knees, but keep them together.&quot; Placing her palms 
          flat on the bed she lifted her knees till they touched her breasts, 
          her toes together pointed at the ceiling. Dropping back to his elbows 
          he licked her from tailbone to clitoris, and then again, and again. 
          She began making little whimpers whenever he touched her clit. <p>
          &quot;Relax.&quot; he said, and she slowly let her legs settle open, 
          placing the soles of her feet on his shoulder blades.<p>
          &quot;I've wanted your mouth on me for so long, I was really hoping...&quot; 
          she whispered, then forgot what else she was going to say as he opened 
          wide and covered her whole pussy with his mouth. He pushed his tongue 
          into her till he reached her hymen with it's tip, then made his tongue 
          short and fat and tried to push it all into the space outside her obstruction. 
          She gasped, and he licked down over the small area separating her pussy 
          from her asshole. As fast as he could, he speared his tongue into her 
          bum again, and twisted it from side to side like a reversing drill.<p>
          &quot;Oooooh!!&quot; she cooed, and convulsed a little. Wrapping his 
          large hands around her slim upper thighs, he lifted her ass off the 
          bed and held her legs wide open, settling on his elbows. He spread his 
          tongue wide and flat, and began licking her entire nether region with 
          long strokes, pressing his tongue against her almost as hard as he could. 
          After a few strokes he'd close his mouth and eyes, and rub his face 
          all over her mound, her pussy, the little hollows by the inside of her 
          thighs, her ass, her open pussy again, then return to the long, hard 
          licks. He realized that he really did prefer to do this without having 
          hair in his mouth, just soft, smooth, warm skin against his lips and 
          tongue and face. They continued like this for long minutes, until he 
          sensed that he could no longer prolong her build-up stage, and that 
          her orgasm was upon her.<p>
          He lowered her ass back to the bed and slid his hands down her thighs 
          to her hips, grasped them firmly and held her pressed down to the bed. 
          He sealed his mouth against her, centered on her clit, pressed his tongue 
          against it and began to lick up and down with light, short strokes. 
          As she came, she thought she was more ready for it this time, but was 
          still caught by surprise by the suddenness and intensity of it. She 
          tried unsuccessfully to hold back the cries that forced themselves from 
          her throat;<p>
          &quot;Mmmmnnngguuuuhhhh!! uuuhhh! uuuuhhh! uuuuhhh!&quot;<p>
          She pressed the inside of her thighs to his ears, her hands pushing 
          hard on the back of his head. She tried to hump against his face, but 
          he held her lower body tight to the bed, and concentrated on giving 
          her only enough stimulation to keep her orgasm going. She tried desperately 
          to rub herself against him harder, to make her orgasm peak, but he held 
          her on the plateau for minutes. When he judged that it was time, he 
          started licking her clitoris a little harder and as fast as he could, 
          to take her over the top.<p>
          She completely lost control of her body and dissolved into spasmodic 
          shakes and shudders. Her voice fell into tiny whines as she panted. 
          Deep, fast, wracking breaths, one after another, she fought for oxygen, 
          her eyes staring off into nothingness. The pleasure waves took over 
          her entire mind.<p>
          As her passion ebbed, he slowed his licking to keep pace with her, until 
          his tongue was almost still, only making a tiny little motion about 
          every five seconds to give her another delightful little aftershock.<p>
          Finally he crawled up beside her and held her gently as her breathing 
          normalized and she came back to the world.</p>
