              <p>The only times you saw people from Buggery having sex with each 
                other were in the live acts at the Night Club and in the hotel 
                bar. And there were literally no holes barred. The sex seemed 
                to go on and on, occasionally interspersed by splendid, even artistic, 
                flourishes of spurting semen. And then with little pause and remarkably 
                prompt recovery, the participants were back at it again. Arses, 
                mouths, vaginas penetrated vigorously and expertly. Positions 
                taken which exceeded either girls' imagination and requiring rather 
                more physical flexibility than either were capable of. A more 
                impossibly energetic or athletic lot you could barely imagine! 
                <p>
                <p>
                To be able to afford their holiday in Buggery, both Sharon and 
                Tracey had told several white lies about their financial wealth: 
                lies that they hoped wouldn't catch up with them while they were 
                on holiday. Perhaps the lies weren't that small, but the girls 
                were somewhat na&iuml;ve as to what they were likely to get away 
                with. At first these lies didn't worry them while they were enjoying 
                so much themselves in Throb.<p>
                Throb was an aptly named resort they found, as this was exactly 
                what their cunts did all the time after each day. They soon got 
                used to days of sex on the beach, in the night clubs, in the hotel 
                and in the bar. They soon stopped wearing any clothes at all: 
                carrying all they needed in shoulder bags. There was no theft 
                in Throb, which was good as they often had to drop their bags 
                wherever they happened to be. Total nudity began to seem a little 
                too innocent for two such worldly girls, and so it wasn't long 
                that like many other tourists and many of the residents of Throb 
                they got their nipples pierced and rings put through them. It 
                didn't stop there. They also had their vulvas pierced in several 
                places. Soon little rings dangled from between their legs to go 
                with the rings through their nipples, the bangles on their arms 
                and the earrings. A pleasing jangle accompanied every step as 
                they walked around. When they raised their arms, a cascade of 
                bangles followed in chorus.<p>
                Every morning, they'd wake up with at least one man sharing their 
                beds, ready for a quick fuck before breakfast. Then after that, 
                some more sex as the day progressed, wherever and whenever it 
                took their fancy. Their vaginas were constantly bruised, they 
                always felt like they were exhausted, but the sex was so very 
                good, they just couldn't turn down any chance for more.<p>
                One evening, they had two young boys in their bed who'd they'd 
                picked up on the beach. &quot;This is fucking paradise!&quot; 
                mused Sharon as a penis thrust in and out of both her arse and 
                her cunt, while Tracey greedily gobbled on the two adjacent set 
                of balls. &quot;This can't be real! Sex wasn't supposed to be 
                as good as this!&quot; In fact, it never had been before. This 
                was real fucking: intense, continuous, not a limp dick in sight. 
                The men back home just had nothing to offer in comparison. They'd 
                never be satisfied like this again.<p>
                The two boys were expert in sharing the attention of the two voracious 
                friends. While one thumped away mercilessly at Sharon's arse, 
                the other was simultaneously fucking Tracey's cunt. And then while 
                the girls were in ecstasy, they'd somehow alter positions: the 
                first boy taking Tracey's arse while the other transferred his 
                attention to Sharon's cunt. And then as Tracey gulped in paroxysms 
                of delight, the one took his prick out of Sharon and pushed it 
                into Sharon's arse, giving her again that full feeling she so 
                craved where inside her she could feel one prick sliding against 
                the other: giving her dual stimulation on the skin dividing one 
                orifice to another. She'd thought that now, after the fucking 
                she'd got at least once every few hours, that by now the pleasure 
                would be diminished. That in some way, she'd lose interest from 
                familiarity. But, no, it was like a drug to her. The more she 
                was fucked, the more she craved it. The soreness of her arse was 
                lessened by the usage, but the desire for it certainly did not. 
                Nor did it for Tracey, who took the opportunity to crawl over 
                the mattress and apply her tongue to the two sets of rock-hard 
                testicles bumping against each other as they pushed and pushed 
                into Sharon. Before long, it was too much for her, as she greedily 
                pulled one boy off her friend, and motioned his erect prick into 
                her cunt. And somehow, like so many times and so many lovers before, 
                the boys knew when they had exhausted the girls and released streams 
                of semen which spurted onto the girls' breasts and flowed onto 
                their bellies.<p>
                &quot;I hope we can do this forever!&quot; remarked Tracey as 
                they wandered down to the foyer, licking traces of semen from 
                their lips. There they saw Lil dressed for the first time since 
                they'd first met her. At first they didn't recognise her in her 
                tight-fitting skirt and top, as up to then, they'd only seen her 
                nude. She wasn't a nudist, as she'd told them many times, and 
                they were keen to reassure her that they weren't either. It was 
                just that clothes were such an unnecessary encumbrance in Throb.<p>
                Lil seemed quite upset. She was standing by herself holding an 
                invoice in her hand. &quot;Look at what the bastards have charged 
                me!&quot; she shrieked when the girls greeted her. &quot;Every 
                fucking drink, every fucking night club and every fucking fuck. 
                All on the bill. Nothing's escaped them at all! How'd they know 
                all this?&quot;<p>
                She showed an itemised bill, which went on for several pages. 
                It listed every drink she'd had, every night club she'd entered 
                and every meal she'd eaten. In addition, it included an itemised 
                account of every sexual encounter she'd had. So much for oral 
                sex, so much for vaginal sex, a bit more for anal sex and a lot 
                more for having someone to spend the night with her. Group sex 
                and lesbian sex were charged at a further premium. Tracey gasped 
                with shock as she glanced at the total and made a rough estimate 
                at what it meant converted back to their home currency. Not only 
                was it a large sum, far more than she'd ever expected, a little 
                extra arithmetic (not something for which she had a native skill), 
                told her that Sharon and she had actually been rather more active 
                and indulgent than Lil (despite her boasts) and that their bill 
                was likely to be several times larger.<p>
                &quot;And it's not just what I've been doing, we'll get charged 
                for. My hubby's been enjoying himself. I don't know the details 
                but from what he's told me we're gonna have the world's most fucking 
                horrendous headache paying for all this. We might be well-off, 
                but haulage don't make millions. I don't think we'll be able to 
                afford another holiday here for a lo-ong while.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Are you leaving now then?&quot; asked Sharon.<p>
                &quot;Yeah! We are. Another day here and we'd have to re-mortgage 
                the house. I can't believe the bastards. Every fucking cock and 
                every fucking cunt!. I'm surprised they didn't charge us by the 
                weight of sperm. And there weren't no hint of this till we settled 
                up. The fucking smile on that bastard girl's face.&quot; She nodded 
                towards the demure but naked receptionist, who with a broad imperturbable 
                smile was serving a bill to another white-faced couple. &quot;I 
                bet she enjoys stinging the fucking tourists! That's how this 
                country makes it money, I reckon. They get us in with a promise 
                of dawn-to-dusk sex (and then a bit more!) and nothing passes 
                them by. Not a single fucking tiny insignificant orgasm. What 
                fucking cheek!&quot;<p>
                &quot;What are you gonna do about it?&quot; wondered Tracey with 
                genuine interest.<p>
                &quot;There's fuckall we can do. We'll just have to pay by credit 
                card and hope the limit's big enough. Hey, here comes hubby!&quot;<p>
                Her husband, a large man in a suit and tee-shirt wandered towards 
                them carrying a small case and holding his bill in his hand. His 
                stubbled face did not look well pleased. &quot;Fucking cunt bastards!&quot; 
                he exclaimed, mirroring his wife's comments. &quot;That orgy on 
                Friday cost us nearly a month's income!&quot;<p>
                Tracey and Sharon retreated to the beach, the only place they 
                knew where they wouldn't be charged for going, and spread themselves 
                out, naked as always except for the jewellery that adorned them 
                . They stared towards the sea where the waves crashed onto the 
                shore and where several other tourists were fucking and being 
                fucked on the fine-grained sand.<p>
                &quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; asked Sharon, knowing 
                full well why Tracey was so untypically quiet.<p>
                &quot;I don't think we can afford the bill.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yeah, but we got plastic. That'll cover it, won't it! What 
                the fuck's plastic for, anyway?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yeah, we got plastic. But we also got, - whatchayoucallit? 
                - credit card limits. That's the most you can put on plastic. 
                The absolute tops.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yeah, well?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yeah, well. It's not gonna be enough. Not nearly fucking 
                enough! Those cunts have got us. You saw what Lil's paying. And 
                you saw what she's paying for. Not even half a dozen fucks a day.&quot;<p>
                &quot;She always said she'd done more than that.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well. She's old, ain't she. She can't do it as much as we 
                can. And anyway, she ain't had our practice. I always thought 
                she were a bit light-weight. We've done two, three, four, I dunno, 
                much more fucking than her.&quot;<p>
                &quot;She can't take it, can she?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yeah, but least she can pay for it. We can't! We're fucking 
                screwed! I don't know what the fuck we're gonna do!&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yeah, so what! It's on plastic, ain't it?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Course it is. But when we come to pay, our plastic's gonna 
                bounce. It's gonna bounce worse than a fucking beach ball. It's 
                gonna bounce. And we're gonna be well and truly fucked.&quot;<p>
                Sharon frowned. She stroked the rings in her labia, the cost of 
                which she was now bitterly regretting. &quot;So, what they gonna 
                do to us?&quot;<p>
                &quot;They're gonna lock us up and throw away the fucking key. 
                We're gonna spend the rest of our lives in some fucking jail. 
                And the fucking ambassador's not gonna bail us out. Not a couple 
                of tarts like us.&quot;<p>
                Sharon's face visibly paled in the sun. She chewed on a fingernail. 
                &quot;I'm scared, Tray. You think that's what they're gonna do?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well! What do you fucking think? This ain't home, is it? 
                They can do what they fucking like here. I don't fancy our chances 
                at all.&quot;<p>
                After further discussion, they decided that the only option open 
                to them was to try and make a quick get-away from Throb to avoid 
                paying the bill. It wasn't a thought uppermost in their minds 
                the last week or so, but now it seemed like the only sensible 
                option. It wouldn't be the first time they'd absconded without 
                paying, but this looked like being the most risky. However, before 
                planning an escape, they first had to survey the lie of the land. 
                One thought they had was that if they left from a different border 
                from the one they arrived they might get away without the Royal 
                Government of Buggery demanding the money that would soon be owing. 
                How to get to this border was the big question. <p>
                Throb was not that large a resort. It was perhaps ten miles along 
                the coast and went two miles inland. Inside the town's perimeters, 
                all was sex and sun. Hotels, night clubs, bars and beach. However, 
                the two friends found that if you walked far in any direction 
                you came across a wire fence guarded by fierce looking men or 
                women with curious rubber truncheons and snarling dogs. Even the 
                furthest reach of the sandy beach was lined with a row of sharp 
                spikes and barbed wire to keep tourists in. And possibly, also 
                to keep other people out. Beyond, this was a kind of wilderness 
                with battered shacks and the odd grazing goat. Although this containment 
                seemed strange to the girls, it essentially meant that it was 
                nowhere as easy to leave Throb as it might at first have seemed.<p>
                &quot;So, do you know of a way out?&quot; Sharon asked Pru in 
                the bar that evening, after having explained their dilemma. She 
                seemed extremely uncomfortable with her knowledge of the girls' 
                circumstances, if not even rather embarrassed/<p>
                &quot;Well, in any normal place, I'd suggest you just come clean,&quot; 
                she answered, &quot;but, here, and don't ever tell anyone I suggested 
                this to you, have you ever thought of going on a day trip? At 
                least you can get out of Throb and maybe you can find your way 
                to another border from there.&quot;<p>
                It had never crossed the two girls' minds to leave the holiday 
                resort. After all, everything they wanted was close at hand. Why 
                go anywhere else? Sharon and Tracey couldn't care less about ruins 
                or museums or anything cultural. They couldn't think of anything 
                more piss-poor boring. But reluctantly, and with a little help 
                from Pru, they had a look at what day trips were available. These 
                were all displayed in a quaint looking Tourist Information Centre 
                near the beach.<p>
                Almost all the day trips were to parts of the country where the 
                main raison d'&ecirc;tre was the sex that was on offer when you 
                got there. One which seemed suitably remote and seemed comfortably 
                close to Sodom, with which Buggery was not at war, was a small 
                place called Pederasty. Besides the promise of &quot;immature 
                love&quot;, there was a medi&aelig;val castle and a particularly 
                large monument to King Peter the Fourteenth, the current ruler 
                of Buggery.<p>
                The two girls left almost all they had at the hotel, except money, 
                jewellery, passports and bikinis for the airport which they tucked 
                into their bags. They didn't want to arouse suspicion by taking 
                things out of their room like toothbrushes or clothes. They got 
                on to a bus full of other tourists heading to Pederasty, which 
                mostly consisted of middle-aged or older men. Many of them were 
                still clothed, but one or two had got into the spirit of life 
                in Buggery and wore nothing but hats to keep the sun off their 
                eyes. These were the men with the most leathery skin and the most 
                lined faces.<p>
                There were only two other women besides themselves. One was a 
                tourist, in her late thirties wearing only glasses and red skin 
                peeling painfully from exposure to the sun. She told Sharon and 
                Tracey that she was keen in getting a boy one-third her age inside 
                her cunt, as it was a life-time ambition of hers. &quot;I've got 
                a son that age, and I often wonder what it's like. What about 
                you?&quot; <p>
                Sharon lied that she also thought that little boys' pricks were 
                the best. &quot;Oooh! I just can't get enough of them!&quot; She 
                exclaimed unconvincingly, although she'd always preferred her 
                pricks as thick and long as possible.<p>
                The other woman was a travel courier and barely a woman at all. 
                She was perhaps thirteen and her breasts were mere bumps with 
                puffy nipples. She wore nothing but a little flower in her cunt 
                which she encouraged the other tourists to tweak. She waggled 
                her bum as she passed by and giggled appreciatively if anyone 
                pinched it. After sucking off a man just opposite them on the 
                bus, Tracey ventured to ask &quot;If we really like it in Pederasty, 
                can we stay the night?&quot; The girl, who called herself Little 
                Pussy, wiped the semen from her mouth and looked a little alarmed.<p>
                &quot;Are you likely to do that?&quot;<p>
                &quot;It sounds like a paradise on earth to us, this Pederasty 
                place, dearie. We'd just love to stay all night.&quot;<p>
                Little Pussy, who had been hard selling the underage delights 
                of Pederasty was put in a difficult position. &quot;Well, it sure 
                is a wonderful place, but are you sure you won't want to go back 
                to Throb?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Can't we just book into a hotel and come back on a bus later, 
                dearie?&quot; suggested Sharon.<p>
                &quot;I'll check with Big Hunk&quot;, Little Pussy said referring 
                to the driver.<p>
                This came back with a reserved affirmative, but both Little Pussy 
                and Big Hunk seemed very uncomfortable with the two girls from 
                then on. Little Pussy was very insistent on having sex with the 
                two girls in the apparent hope of changing their minds, but although 
                Sharon let her, and had to admit she was very good at it, that 
                couldn't have been sufficient. In any case, although she liked 
                the attention of Little Pussy's fingers and tongue on her vagina, 
                not to mention her nipples and mouth, it was men she preferred. 
                Both she and Tracey had always preferred a good cock: though given 
                the choice between the pleasant firm body of the little girl and 
                the flabby, unpleasant looking bodies of the male tourists they 
                were with, she couldn't be sure that her interests were really 
                so gynaecological rather than aesthetic. She took pleasure, as 
                she lay back on her seat next to Tracey, with the small girl between 
                them, fingers and tongues sharing their sunburnt bodies equally, 
                at the stares she was receiving from the other tourists. Fuck 
                you! She thought with pleasure as she saw one overweight man uncomfortably 
                stroking his tiny penis, trying to get more life into what little 
                of it there was.<p>
                Certainly, the girls became aware that although in terms of sexual 
                activity they had a freedom impossible at home, their freedom 
                was circumscribed in other ways. As they passed through the town 
                limits of Throb, the guards were very insistent in looking at 
                passports and at the things the girls were carrying. &quot;Why 
                the bikini?&quot; asked one border guard, a very muscular woman 
                wearing leather boots and shoulder pads but nothing else but well-built 
                muscles. <p>
                &quot;Too much sun&quot;, suggested Tracey. The guard sniffed. 
                It was the couriers, not the tourists, who got most attention 
                from the guards and none of it very friendly. Little Pussy had 
                her legs prised open while one guard shoved his fingers inside 
                her cunt as if he were looking for something. She smiled weakly 
                at the rest of the bus during this obvious humiliation, while 
                the guard licked the come off the fingers of one hand, but continued 
                probing with his other hand. <p>
                It was a relief for the girls, but even more so for Little Pussy, 
                when the bus finally drove out of Throb and travelled through 
                the countryside of Buggery. This was the first time the girls 
                had seen so much of Buggery outside of Throb, and it was not especially 
                beautiful. The countryside consisted mostly of parched farmland 
                with pot-holed roads, lined at intervals of every hundred meters 
                by large posters of King Peter XIV. In fact, there were rather 
                more reminders of his rule outside Throb than they'd ever seen 
                inside. Every small village had a statue of him and of previous 
                monarchs. Every lamp post and every telegraph pole had a portrait 
                of him attached to it. The impression given from the pictures 
                and statues was that he was a genial and dignified person. His 
                favourite pose was to stare into the half-distance, with a grim 
                smile, surrounded at his knees by a coterie of seated attractive 
                naked women whilst brutal looking men stood just beside him looking 
                towards him with proud admiring gazes. <p>
                In the fields were peasants in various degrees and types of undress. 
                They stopped briefly at one village, which appeared to operate 
                entirely for the benefit of tourists, where they were allowed 
                to stretch their legs and buy drinks and snacks from some makeshift 
                stalls. This had an ambience very similar to the small markets 
                of Throb, but didn't offer nearly enough other distraction to 
                encourage anyone to stay.<p>
                IV
              <p>It was after several hours of bumpy roads and undistinguished 
                fields that the bus eventually arrived at Pederasty. This was 
                no more prepossessing than anything else they'd seen, being a 
                small walled town surrounded by dirt and rubble, beyond which 
                stretched interminable miles of country lanes and fields of naked 
                labouring peasants. Little Pussy stood up and opened the bus door. 
                &quot;Welcome to Pederasty. The little joys and desires you've 
                always wanted to sample are here for you. The rules which usually 
                bound behaviour in Buggery are totally removed here: so it doesn't 
                matter how young he is, just go ahead!&quot;<p>
                The passengers filed out into a town full of little boys. At first 
                it looked like there were little girls there as well, and that 
                the boys were just the naked ones who were sitting indolently 
                around. But some of the apparent girls in their pretty plaits, 
                ribbons and little dresses pulled up their dresses to show that 
                not only were there no knickers there but that they were in fact 
                also boys as well. The passengers were soon surrounded by willing 
                crowds of boys who dragged them willingly away to whatever it 
                is they wanted to do. The middle-aged woman was one of those who 
                opted for the attention of one of the boys dressed as a little 
                girl. She stood by the road side and enjoyed him stroking her 
                well-worn cunt.<p>
                &quot;I'll escort you to the hotel,&quot; announced Little Pussy 
                to Sharon and Tracey before they disembarked. &quot;And can you 
                sign this document to say that you're not coming back today otherwise 
                the police will be very unhappy to see that the numbers leaving 
                Throb aren't the same as those returning.&quot;<p>
                They signed the document and then walked with Little Pussy towards 
                the hotel. This was just outside the walls of the town and had 
                the appearance of a converted monastery. &quot;Aren't there any 
                little girls here?&quot; asked Sharon.<p>
                &quot;Goodness no!&quot; said Little Pussy a little aghast. They 
                passed by one of the tourists who was buggering a boy and in turn 
                being buggered from behind by another boy. &quot;If you wanted 
                little girls, you should have gone to Tight Rim. There's lots 
                of little girls there - most of them younger than me! They'd give 
                you the treat of your life and they don't care what you do! If 
                that's what you want I can arrange it for you. Or if you don't 
                want to leave Throb, we can arrange for a little girl to come 
                to your room at the time of your choosing!&quot;<p>
                Sharon declined the offer. She wasn't too sure she even really 
                wanted sex with a little boy. She was beginning to think there 
                was something slightly distasteful about all these boys running 
                around shoving their fingers up their bums and wiggling their 
                little willies.<p>
                Little Pussy left them at the reception desk of the hotel. &quot;I'd 
                love to stay longer, but I've got to look after the welfare of 
                the others. It always gets difficult rounding them up at 6 o'clock, 
                so don't be too surprised if you find that some others decide 
                to stay here.&quot; She didn't really sound like she believed 
                that, but it was clear that the Petit Gar&ccedil;on Hotel had 
                its fair share of guests. They were mostly elderly men, but there 
                were a few younger couples sitting in the hotel bar. The staff 
                were all young boys, and a fair proportion were dressed like chambermaids 
                and waitresses. In fact a chambermaid could be seen with his prick 
                firmly up the anus of a waitress who was lying on his back with 
                his legs hooked by his arms. This seemed to be for the entertainment 
                of the people drinking in the bar. <p>
                The receptionist was another boy dressed to look like a girl with 
                very thick lipstick and pendulous earrings. He looked at the girls' 
                passports and copied the details into his book. &quot;How long 
                are you staying?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Tomorrow?&quot; suggested Tracey. <p>
                The receptionist nodded and wrote this down. &quot;A boy each, 
                is it?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Sorry, love?&quot;<p>
                &quot;You can have a boy for each of you or one between two. A 
                boy each?&quot;<p>
                &quot;One between two,&quot; said Sharon, who wasn't too keen. 
                &quot;And make him, erm, sixteen.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I'm afraid fourteen's the oldest we've got. I'm fourteen. 
                Fancy me? Or do you want to see the selection?&quot; He presented 
                the girls with brochure in which there were photographs of many 
                naked, or near-naked, boys with details as to their sexual preferences. 
                &quot;We've got a boy for every taste. But if you don't see exactly 
                what you want, I'm sure whoever you choose can be precisely as 
                accommodating as you wish.<p>
                Sharon and Tracey absent-mindedly pointed at the glossy photographs 
                of one little boy from the selection, and as they'd seen about 
                as much as they really wanted to see of Pederasty, they went straight 
                to their bedroom.<p>
                &quot;We'll leave tomorrow with our passports!&quot; announced 
                Sharon, as soon as they got there. &quot;That little boy's hardly 
                got a prick at all! What do we expect him to do? Stick it in our 
                ears?&quot;<p>
                In fact, Bum Fluff, as he was called, was quite ingenious with 
                what he could do. He looked younger than his years, though, partly 
                because the hair on his groin had been plucked out and partly 
                because he was rather short. His prick was quite a respectable 
                size after all, but after the double, and sometimes triple, entries 
                the girls had got used to in Throb it was only by keeping the 
                jewellery in place in their vaginas that they managed to gain 
                anything like the sensation they'd got accustomed to. He seemed 
                quite relieved when the girls didn't use the sex tools that were 
                provided by the hotel to bugger him from behind. It was a bit 
                of a shock to Sharon, but when he rolled onto his stomach after 
                squirting his sperm into Tracey's cunt, she could see a little 
                bit of dried blood congealed at the bottom of his anus just by 
                his little testicles.<p>
                &quot;Did you hurt yourself love?&quot; wondered Sharon stroking 
                his buttocks.<p>
                &quot;Occupational hazard,&quot; smiled Bum Fluff.<p>
                &quot;There're some rough sorts here, aren't there love?&quot; 
                confided Tracey, who was thinking more of the lads back home.<p>
                Bum Fluff didn't compromise himself further by commenting, so 
                the girls didn't pursue the subject. The girls kissed him gently 
                on the cheek, and let him lie on the bed beside them. Sharon turned 
                on the television. There was good old Buggery Broadcasting Corporation 
                which was showing a program on the correct way to shave around 
                the penis. &quot;Remember, use tweezers - never a razor-blade,&quot; 
                came the advice from a very sweet young lady who was tugging out 
                hairs from a very tumescent penis.<p>
                The other two channels were showing videos: both featuring under-age 
                sex. &quot;One side's boys and the other's girls,&quot; explained 
                Bum Fluff.<p>
                &quot;You mean boys dressed up as girls.&quot;<p>
                &quot;No, the real thing! It's the only place we ever see little 
                girls. I'd like to fuck one.&quot; He turned the television channel 
                from the one showing a boy being fucked by a boy from behind in 
                turn being fucked from one behind him, to a program showing a 
                girl of ten who was sitting on an older man's lap with a prick 
                right up her vagina.<p>
                Bum Fluff, Sharon and Tracey watched this film which was the story 
                of little girls between eight and twelve who made love with each 
                other, were buggered by older men or had objects pushed up their 
                orifices. &quot;Sometimes you see them with dogs and donkeys,&quot; 
                explained Bum Fluff a little too excitedly. &quot;I often wish 
                I was one of those donkeys!&quot;<p>
                After the film had finished and Bum Fluff had excused himself, 
                the girls didn't stay much longer to savour more of the delights 
                of Pederasty. In fact, when Bum Fluff left the room, Sharon felt 
                somewhat disgusted with herself. She wasn't used to feelings of 
                moral guilt or regret, but somehow this was different. The children 
                here were not as good at appearing to enjoy themselves as the 
                residents of Throb, and, in any case, child sex had never been 
                one of Sharon's fantasies. Nothing was better than a good long 
                stiff prick and a real man's body. The other tourists rather disgusted 
                her. Indeed, they'd probably have disgusted her anyway. Older 
                men and fat men and patently unprepossessing men had never attracted 
                her. She felt genuinely sorry for the boys who had to endure their 
                predatory attentions.<p>
                &quot;I dunno,&quot; said Tracey, when Sharon confessed her feelings. 
                &quot;It's us we gotta look out for. These kids'll get fucked 
                whether we're here or not, but it's our own fucking skin we gotta 
                worry about most.&quot;<p>
                Before the afternoon shadows shortened , Sharon and Tracey sneaked 
                out with their passports (which they'd pretended they'd left at 
                Throb to avoid leaving them at reception) and carried their meagre 
                possessions in their beach bags and uncharacteristically avoided 
                the sexual advances of the staff. <p>
                &quot;I know exactly what you can do tonight,&quot; suggested 
                the receptionist as they strolled past him. &quot;Ever tried four 
                at once! Each! It can be done you know!&quot;<p>
                &quot;We'll be alright dearie,&quot; assured Tracey. &quot;We'll 
                find plenty to get on with.&quot;<p>
                It wasn't that easy getting out of Pederasty, although there weren't 
                guards surrounding it as there were in Throb. The entrance to 
                the hotel was surrounded by idling boys who were advertising what 
                they had to offer. &quot;Up my bum!&quot; called out one languorously. 
                &quot;Me and my mates!&quot; called another, turning his backside 
                to the girls and pushing his middle finger right up his arse. 
                <p>
                &quot;Bit shagged out love,&quot; explained Sharon unconvincingly.<p>
                One of the sights available to the more discerning tourist was 
                a small dilapidated castle, known by its original name of Mons 
                Regis. This was just outside the town's castellated walls. As 
                they had no better idea, Sharon and Tracey decided to walk in 
                that direction in the hope of finding a bus-stop and catching 
                a bus that might be headed towards the Sodom border. They felt 
                sure they had enough money on them to be able to afford the bus 
                fare and even a cheap flight home from the Sodom airport (perhaps 
                on stand-by). This was because whilst at Pederasty, they'd hardly 
                touched the cash they'd changed at the airport and had been mostly 
                relying on plastic to settle their accounts.<p>
                The walled perimeter of the town of Pederasty and the towers of 
                the hotel receded behind them as they walked along in their beach 
                sandals along the parched and uneven dusty road. They wore nothing 
                else, not even the bikinis they'd packed, as they felt that wearing 
                clothes somehow attracted attention to them. As everyone else 
                was naked, how could they dress any different. Even so, their 
                beach bags bulged with even the few possessions they had: a decidedly 
                miscellaneous collection of cosmetics and knickknacks. <p>
                As they walked, the castle got steadily bigger and the town steadily 
                smaller until all that could be seen of Pederasty was some old 
                ruins in a field that had once been a thriving township laid waste 
                in an earlier war with Sodom. A goat was tethered by a tree and 
                there was a small monument scattered with flowers and ribbons.<p>
                &quot;There must be a fucking bus-stop somewhere!&quot; exclaimed 
                Sharon. &quot;People here can't walk everywhere.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well, they don't seem to use cars or anything. We ain't 
                seen nothing since we left the hotel. Any my feet are already 
                fucking killing me!&quot;<p>
                They came to a cross-roads. One way pointed towards the capital 
                city of Buggery, Petersville, named after the King. The other 
                pointed towards the castle and somewhere called innocently Newtown. 
                The girls decided to take the third option, away from the city 
                of Petersville on the basis that that was probably the direction 
                to Sodom.<p>
                &quot;If anyone stops us we can say we got lost,&quot; Tracey 
                said: not sure why anyone should stop them. Or judging from the 
                mostly empty landscape, if there was anyone who could. <p>
                The girls seemed to have been walking for hours. The sun was still 
                high and the girls' feet were getting increasingly sore. &quot;I've 
                got fucking blisters on my fucking blisters!&quot; complained 
                Tracey. Not only their feet were suffering, but the weight of 
                the jangling jewelry from their cunts chafed against their thighs 
                and they were getting increasingly annoyed at the clanking sound 
                that followed them around. In Throb, they enjoyed their presence, 
                as it said to the world that they didn't fucking care about a 
                fucking thing. And fuck you! There was no way that this was how 
                they felt now as it became more and more clear that each bed in 
                the road was only followed by another bend. That the only features 
                in the terrain were the gently sloping hills which obscured where 
                they were going. That the only landmarks were either parched trees 
                or piles of rocks, sometimes stacked on each other and painted 
                crudely in a fading peeling white.<p>
                And still, they saw no bus-stops. Not even that: there were no 
                caf&eacute;s, no villages and no shops. Where could they get food 
                from? They knew there must be some food, because they could see 
                the odd peasant working in the fields and on one occasion a donkey-drawn 
                cart passed them by. The donkey was a wretched specimen. Flies 
                hovered around and inside its drooping ears and nasty scabs scarred 
                its back. The woman on the beaten-up wagon dressed much the same 
                way as the peasants in the field, which was slightly more modest 
                than Sharon and Tracey were used to. No ribbons on penises, or 
                flowers in vaginas or the healthy demeanours of the residents 
                of Throb. She wore a very short slip or jacket which came to less 
                than half-way down her chest and then nothing till you reached 
                the knees where she wore battered plastic sandals. Like the other 
                peasants, her hair was rather short, but she sensibly wore a straw 
                hat to keep the sun off her eyes. Like the peasants, she seemed 
                intent on ignoring the girls, pretending they weren't there and 
                then deliberately forced her donkey to trot by faster so she couldn't 
                be hailed.<p>
                It was nearly evening before anyone spoke to the girls. With sweat 
                pouring down their still pale skin, and dirt and dust on their 
                knees, they had as good as abandoned hope of ever finding a bus-stop, 
                They weren't used to walking back home, and normally when they 
                did it was along better road surfaces and not in such intense 
                heat. Their feet was sore, and their were scratches and bruises 
                on their legs and knees where they had stumbled onto the dusty 
                rocky road, exhausted by the heat and the unfamiliar exertion 
                of so much walking.<p>
                They noticed a large tree by the road-side which would give them 
                some shelter from the early evening sun. This was a rare sight 
                in itself in the barren rocky landscape, so it took no persuading 
                for them to take advantage of its shade. In fact, for they didn't 
                know how many miles, this had been the destination of their plodding, 
                stumbling, aching tread. The only pleasure they got and the only 
                distraction from their pains was to see the tree grow steadily 
                larger as they proceeded. Tracey occasionally licked her sore 
                tongue over her cracked dry lips. This was the worst! She moaned 
                to herself, barely able to strain her voice into articulation. 
                This was the fucking worst! She'd never known that walking could 
                be so fucking tiring. And the country was so fucking horrible. 
                No wonder she'd never gone for walks in the country back home. 
                What she wouldn't have given to be back in her bed at the hotel 
                just lying on the bed. She'd just lie there, soaking up her exhaustion.<p>
                The shade of the tree offered none of the luxury they'd got so 
                used to recently. The bare earth offered none of the bouncy softness 
                of their mattresses, and there was nothing remotely like the soft 
                cooling breeze of the air conditioner to blow off the sweat which 
                plastered every inch of their skin. They sat on the crackling 
                dry grass, pushed aside some of the sharp rocks, and lay down 
                on their backs. As soon as they did, their legs, arms and feet 
                throbbed with release after their unaccustomed exercise, and their 
                skin burnt from the sun from which their factor 8 sun-screen had 
                offered such poor protection. <p>
                &quot;What the fuck do we do now!&quot; gasped Tracey.<p>
                Sharon didn't really have the energy to reply. &quot;I dunno,&quot; 
                she murmured, as much to herself as Sharon. &quot;I dunno. I don't 
                fucking know!&quot;<p>
                What little energy they had wasn't sufficient to stir them, despite 
                the discomfort of the ground and the constant attention of the 
                little midges and flies which congregated around them. Insects 
                crawled into the girls' hair, into the corners of their eyes, 
                skimmed over their sweat-drenched skin and crept past the girls' 
                vaginal jewellery onto the lips of their cunts. The girls lay 
                flat out, staring at the sky through the leafless branches of 
                the tree. <p>
                &quot;I'm not so sure it was such a great idea doing this,&quot; 
                moaned Sharon repeatedly. <p>
                &quot;Just give me food and water,&quot; echoed Tracey. &quot;I 
                don't fucking care what the bastards do to us! I just want something 
                to eat!&quot;<p>
                &quot;Are you tourists?&quot; suddenly came a voice. The girls 
                opened their cracked eyelids to see that they were being looked 
                down on by three girls with neat shoulder-length hair, wearing 
                white blouses to just below their breasts and a naked body down 
                to the knees where they wore little black shoes and knee-high 
                socks.<p>
                &quot;Of course they are!&quot; another insisted. &quot;Only tourists 
                look like that: look at all the jewelry. And why don't they cut 
                their hair?&quot;<p>
                The girls can't have been much more than fourteen years old, but 
                their vaginas were cut to a half inch stubble in different shapes. 
                One was in the shape of a royal crest, another a star and the 
                third a little diamond. The jewellery they wore consisted of a 
                single small ring pierced over the entrance to the vagina from 
                which dangled a little chain.<p>
                &quot;What do you think of Buggery?&quot; one girl asked them. 
                &quot;Is it like this where you come from?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Come on girls, what's going on?&quot; came a sudden school-teacherly 
                voice. A woman in her late twenties loomed into view. Like the 
                girls she wore nothing from below her breasts to her knees, but 
                what she did wear were smart leather boots and a very neat jacket 
                with a silk scarf. Her long hair was tied back in a long plait 
                to her waist. &quot;Oh I see,&quot; she remarked seeing Sharon 
                and Tracey.<p>
                &quot;Please miss, we've found some tourists. Shall we report 
                them to the police?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Don't worry about that. I can look after them now. I'll 
                get the police if need be. Now you run along.&quot; She produced 
                a cane which she half-heartedly beat against the buttocks of one 
                of the girls. <p>
                &quot;Yes, miss. We will, miss&quot; they said as they ran off 
                giggling.<p>
                &quot;Well,&quot; said the teacher looking at Sharon and Tracey. 
                &quot;You are in a pickle. Well, don't worry, security's relatively 
                lax round here and no one really reports things to the police: 
                people don't appreciate being raped or humiliated for the pain 
                of being a good citizen. However,&quot; she smiled grimly, &quot;I'd 
                better take you along with me if you don't want to die of exposure 
                or dehydration.&quot;<p>
                Sharon and Tracey didn't realise how weak they were until they 
                stood up and then they almost immediately fell down. &quot;Come 
                along girls,&quot; the teacher said cheerfully. &quot;I'll take 
                you to the cottage I live in. I share it with two other women: 
                both teachers like me. One teaches in a Royal College and the 
                other teaches in a Police School. Me,&quot; she sighed, &quot;I 
                teach in a normal secondary school.&quot;<p>
                The teacher escorted the girls for another mile along some paths 
                through fields and over some stiles until they got to her cottage. 
                Sharon and Tracey supported each other and grew more and more 
                annoyed by the chafing of jewellery on their thighs. Each step 
                was an increasing agony of bursting blisters, and more cuts on 
                their ankles and knees when they stumbled and fell onto the unforgiving 
                harsh dry ground. <p>
                After what seemed the longest mile of their lives so far, they 
                came to a tumble-down cottage outside of which rested an old bicycle 
                and the scattered remains of a disused plough. A well stood underneath 
                the shade of a dead tree, and chickens ran around in the yard. 
                A few small trees were gathered into an excuse of a copse where 
                a donkey was desultorily chewing on a carrot.<p>
                The teacher took the girls inside, laid them down on a very hard 
                straw-filled bed, and with no ceremony removed the girls' shoes 
                and unthreaded the jewellery from between their legs. <p>
                &quot;You just lie here and relax,&quot; she advised, as if they 
                were likely to do anything else. &quot;I've got afternoon classes 
                to attend to. If the other teachers are back here before me, my 
                name is Primrose.&quot;<p>
                &quot;That's a nice name,&quot; commented Sharon weakly with what 
                remained of her battered senses.<p>
                &quot;We're all named after flowers round here,&quot; smiled Primrose 
                as she was about to leave. &quot;It's the law.&quot; <p>
              </p>
