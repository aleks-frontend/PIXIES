              <p>M/F, F/F &amp; just about everything else
              <p><p>
                After I got over the initial shock of Pamela leaving me - with 
                a tremendous amount of help and support from Lindsay - I finally 
                decided to address that tiny voice of guilt within my mind. It 
                always seemed to be there when I watched the girls in their private 
                moments from the comfort of my voyeur room. I knew it was wrong 
                to eavesdrop on them, but at the same time, could not help myself. 
                I was a bona-fide voyeur.<p>
                &quot;If any of you want to go home, considering what I just told 
                you, I will stay pay you the $3 million I promised for spending 
                the entire winter here,&quot; I said to the entire group of ladies, 
                with all of us gathered in the meeting room. I had finally confessed 
                my sin - so to speak - and came clean about the voyeur room. I 
                also went into great detail about how voyeurism was really a sickness 
                of mine, and stressed the fact that my tapes would NEVER fall 
                into the wrong hands.<p>
                Lindsay and Amy, of course, already knew all about the voyeur 
                room. Torrie, Devon, and Stephanie were not aware of it, however. 
                At least, I thought they weren't.<p>
                I was totally caught off-guard when Amy informed me that those 
                three ladies had known about the voyeur room for the past several 
                weeks. Amy said she had told them of my secret when she found 
                out about it herself. After first telling them, Amy went onto 
                explain to Torrie, Devon and Stephanie many of the same things 
                I had spoken to her about that very evening. Amy said that all 
                of the footage was only being used for my personal amusement - 
                and nothing else. It may have been creepy, she said, but I was 
                not a bad person.<p>
                &quot;It's good to see that you finally confessed about it yourself, 
                Jeremy,&quot; Devon said to me, nodding her head. &quot;We've 
                been waiting for this day to come for some time.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You're not mad? None of you?&quot; I asked, surprised. I 
                surely thought one of the ladies would want to be on the next 
                flight out of Peru.<p>
                &quot;We're not mad, no,&quot; Torrie replied.<p>
                &quot;We're all a bunch of exhibitionists anyway,&quot; Stephanie<p>
                chimed in. &quot;It's kind of hot knowing someone is watching.<p>
                It makes me... want to be nastier.&quot;<p>
                The reason I told the girls - and I explained this to them in 
                detail - about the voyeur room was because I figured we had been 
                through enough pain and heartache already. With Pamela and Trish 
                suddenly leaving the island, I just thought that no one else deserved 
                to get hurt any further.<p>
                That is why I came clean about the voyeur room - which was really 
                the only secret about myself I still had kept from them. If anyone 
                got angry enough to go home, I offered the full $3 million for 
                their time and services - even though there were still seven weeks 
                remaining in their contracts. I simply figured it was the right 
                thing to do. Fortunately, no one took me up on that offer.<p>
                &quot;We rather stay here for now,&quot; Stephanie told me.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>Ours was a complicated situation because while I was trying to 
                pick up the pieces of my life - thanks to Pamela and what she 
                had done to me - I also had to be a source of strength for Lindsay. 
                She had not only lost Pamela, but Trish as well. What made things 
                even more complicated was that at the same time, Lindsay had to 
                provide a lot of love and guidance for me, too. Lindsay and I 
                had to help each other get through this difficult time as best 
                we could.<p>
                Another person who helped us out a lot - and this may come as 
                a surprise to some (but not me) - was Amy. Though quite aggressive 
                in nature, I always knew that Amy could be sweet and caring when 
                the situation called for it. Proof of that was one evening, Amy 
                held and comforted Lindsay in her arms until the 19-year-old cried 
                herself to sleep. It was a very touching, heartwarming moment 
                for me to witness.<p>
                The pornstar had also touched my heart one evening, when presenting 
                me with a family heirloom. It was a ring with a tiny crown on 
                top, a heart in the center and two hands at the bottom. &quot;I 
                want you have this, Jeremy,&quot; she said to me. &quot;The crown 
                represents loyalty, meaning I will always be loyal to you. The 
                hands are a show of friendship. And the heart... well, you know 
                what that means.&quot;<p>
                She slipped the ring onto my finger and added, &quot;I was supposed 
                to save this for my husband - whoever that may turn out to be 
                - but it is yours, Jeremy. Whenever you feel sad, look at this 
                and maybe it will make you feel better.&quot;<p>
                Of course, I was blown away by the simple fact that Amy was offering 
                me a (treasured) family heirloom. I declined to accept it at first 
                because of that, but Amy insisted and finally broke my resolve. 
                I told her I would wear the ring from now on - and it would always 
                remind me of her.<p>
                Although that was her sweet and caring side on display, the nymphomaniac 
                in Amy was still visibly present. All one had to do to find it 
                was look at Stephanie, who was becoming more of a submissive to 
                Amy with every passing day.<p>
                The sultry brunette usually had her &quot;collar&quot; on - which 
                signified her submission to Amy. A leather choker with the term 
                &quot;SLUT&quot; engraved in its front, Stephanie wore it proudly. 
                Usually, she could be found in mini-dresses and skirts. Amy seemed 
                to enjoy her &quot;property&quot; dressed in this manner...<p>
                Having not been here that long, Stephanie was out of the loop 
                - so to speak - in regards to what Pamela and Trish had done to 
                Lindsay and myself. Stephanie felt sorry for us, but not quite 
                to the extent that Amy or Torrie did. Both of them, of course, 
                had been here during the summer and had a deeper, more rooted 
                connection to everything.<p>
                Stephanie was so very focused upon Amy, however, so her thoughts 
                were perfectly understandable. She felt sorry for what happened 
                - as I said - but not to a great extent. Amy was the thing that 
                mattered to her the most.<p>
                Devon had been here just as long as had Stephanie, but her feelings 
                for Lindsay and myself were far more developed. Devon had all 
                but openly professed her love for me, and she had grown quite 
                close to Lindsay over the past few weeks. She was devastated by 
                the tragic events, and spent a lot of time crying out her feelings.<p>
                Torrie was doing her best to, inparticular, help Lindsay through 
                the pain of losing both Pamela and Trish. Torrie WAS in love with 
                Lindsay, and I could tell that it really hurt her to see the 19-year-old 
                in any sort of anguish.<p>
                It was a bad time.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>After the new year, I received a rather nice pick-me-up courtesy 
                of an old friend - Christina. The one person who had helped me 
                so much in the past, Christina called me on the telephone one 
                evening and expressed deepest sympathies for my failed marriage. 
                She told me that Amy had sent her an e-mail, explaining the whole 
                situation in detail.<p>
                Christina went onto say that she and Lisa - another island alum 
                from the summer - were still living together and attending college 
                in Illinois. It warmed my heart so much to hear Christina say 
                that without me, she and Lisa would have never met - and thus, 
                never fallen in love.<p>
                I then spoke with Lisa, and she made me promise to travel to Illinois 
                sometime later this year so I can visit her and Christina. Amy, 
                Lindsay and Torrie also took turns talking with Christina and 
                Lisa, respectively. The call lasted so long that it basically 
                consumed that entire evening.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>I tried to make sense of why Pamela had left me, but it was really 
                no use. I loved that woman with every ounce of my being, but it 
                wasn't good enough for her. Pamela had always been a reclusive 
                sort who had kept many things to herself. Still, I could kick 
                myself for not seeing even a hint of this earlier.<p>
                As I write these words about Pamela, I can only ask myself one 
                question. Why? Why am I doing this? I could go on forever and 
                try to theorize why Pamela (as well as Trish) had done this to 
                us. It was just no use. I guess we will never know their true 
                feelings, or what made them do what they did. It was unfortunate, 
                but true.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>Time certainly heals all wounds, but I was learning that for 
                me, it was a very slow and gradual process. Two weeks after my 
                wife had left me, I decided that it would be best if all of the 
                ladies - excluding Lindsay and Devon - simply left the island. 
                I needed more time - as did Lindsay - to sort through our damaged 
                emotions and feelings.<p>
                So, instead of $3 million, I offered the other ladies $5 million 
                apiece to go home. Amy, Stephanie and Torrie protested, naturally, 
                but I told them that it wasn't fair to them that they spend the 
                remainder of the winter with all these negative emotions swirling 
                around. Plus, neither Lindsay or myself were enjoying the added 
                company all that much. We were too miserable... and needed more 
                time.<p>
                Torrie was a bit curious as to why Devon could stay on the island 
                - but she couldn't. Devon had strong feelings for me, and Torrie's 
                love for Lindsay was well chronicled.<p>
                I told her that the reason we did that was because Devon was real 
                unhappy at home with her family - and really had no home to return 
                to. Torrie did not like that reason, though, saying it was unfair. 
                She left the island - mad at me.<p>
                There were two more reasons why Devon was staying, although I 
                kept them a secret from Torrie. First off, even in my weakened 
                state, I found that I could not go on without the gorgeous, stunning 
                Devon in my life. She was just too beautiful - and seeing her 
                on a daily basis would surely aid me in my therapy and recovery. 
                Plus, I knew her feelings for me were not only pure and genuine, 
                but also steadfast.<p>
                Secondly - and this was the main reason why Torrie could not stay 
                - Lindsay still did not love her enough. Lindsay thought Torrie 
                was a very nice and caring person... a sweet woman, but she did 
                not TRULY love her. There was no sense in her staying because 
                of that, especially with Amy and Stephanie leaving. That would 
                not be fair to do to them.<p>
                I told Amy and Stephanie, as well as Torrie, that all of them 
                were more than welcome to return to the island once Lindsay and 
                I were in a better state of mind. Amy and Stephanie seemed to 
                be absolute locks to return whenever that day may be - but Torrie 
                was a different matter. She was too mad at me to give me a definite 
                answer.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>I was unsure what Torrie planned on doing with her life, but 
                Amy and Stephanie went to California with the idea of making more 
                X-rated movies together. I missed all three, but knew Lindsay 
                and I would need this time away from them to iron out our feelings 
                and emotions.<p>
                Devon would be here to support us.</p>
              <p>&lt;&lt;&lt;- The End -&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
              <p><p>
                AUTHOR'S NOTE: It was quite a sudden end to the story, but understandable 
                with the recent turn of events.<p>
                What will happen to Lindsay and Jeremy? How will Devon factor 
                into all of this? Is anyone curious how things will turn out when 
                Jeremy invites the others back to the island? Amy and Stephanie 
                will come. How about Torrie? Will there be any new ladies added 
                to the mix?<p>
                In other words... who wants a third sequel? If you do - or even 
                if you don't - please drop me an e-mail saying so at HighlanderJM@hotmail.com. 
                Your words will play an important role as to whether or not I 
                resume the series.<p>
                Thank you for reading my story, and have a wonderful day. :)</p>
