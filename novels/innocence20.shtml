                In Which Innocence is lost in Congress; and Twelve introduces 
                Innocence to the literary merits of Honore.
              <p>Twelve had no intention of returning to the flat to rejoin Chastity. 
                She'd had just about enough of her and how she'd persuade her 
                to do things with her young lovers that made her feel guilty and 
                soiled. She carried her rucksack of possessions over her shoulder 
                through the streets of Labia, relishing the attention her appearance 
                aroused, and made her way to the railway station. She wasn't that 
                surprised to find Innocence sitting on a bench in the station 
                with her own untidy bags at her feet and her face buried in her 
                hands. As she approached she could see that the bags were hurriedly 
                packed and that several articles of clothing protruded through 
                the openings of the bags. She placed a comforting hand on Innocence's 
                shoulder.<p>
                &quot;Are you alright, Innocence darling?&quot;<p>
                The unhappy girl raised her face to show the tears welling from 
                her eyes and their liquid trails reflected on her cheeks. &quot;Leave 
                me alone! Don't touch me!&quot;<p>
                Twelve removed her hand tactfully. &quot;Where are you going, 
                Innocence sweetest?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Somewhere. Nowhere. Anywhere! I don't know!&quot;<p>
                &quot;I'll put you up in my bedsit for a day or so, if you like. 
                It's a bit cramped, but it's the least I can do after the hospitality 
                you've shown me.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I don't want to! I don't want anything to do with my sister. 
                Or any of her lovers!&quot;<p>
                &quot;Don't be silly, Innocence. You've got to stay somewhere. 
                You can't just sleep here. And you've never been to the capital 
                before, have you? City life may well agree with you. Come on! 
                I insist! I can't permit myself to leave you in this state!&quot;<p>
                It took a fair more effort on Twelve's part, but eventually she 
                persuaded Innocence to pick up her bags and join her on one of 
                the many trains heading to the capital city of Congress. She sat 
                next to Innocence with her arms around the girl's shoulders, squeezing 
                her close to her breast, wiping away her tears and listening without 
                comment to Innocence's long litany of complaints about Chastity. 
                Her sister was blamed for almost every misfortune that had ever 
                occurred in her life - a little unfairly Twelve thought, but she 
                had long believed that it was merely a matter of time until the 
                two separated.<p>
                Twelve's bedsit on the twelfth floor of a tall apartment block 
                was undeniably small. It consisted mostly of a single bed that 
                filled out the space not occupied by a small shower, a single 
                oven ring and a small cupboard that held all her worldly possessions. 
                There was no space for any more furniture, and it was necessary 
                for all her guests to join her on her bed. A small television 
                set sat on top of the audio equipment piled high on the cupboard. 
                Every available inch of wall was covered with postcards and posters 
                that reflected her present obsessions and quite a few that she'd 
                had and had not yet wholly abandoned. As always, it was with some 
                difficulty that she pushed open her door as it caught on the cigarette 
                stained carpet which covered the floor, and ignored the stares 
                of her nosy neighbour - a girl who Twelve disdainfully noticed 
                was unfashionably dressed in a twelve-inch dildo strapped to her 
                waist with two long plaits at the back of her otherwise shaved 
                head.<p>
                Twelve comforted Innocence as best she could, and with the skill 
                that had come from considerable practice she divested the girl 
                of all her clothes and persuaded her penis into erection and then 
                into her welcoming vagina. She knew that Innocence was making 
                love more out of a need for distraction than any degree of passion 
                or affection, but she accepted that. It in no way lessened the 
                pleasure she received as Innocence thrust deeply in and out of 
                her. She buried her tongue deep into Innocence's mouth, gliding 
                it over her teeth and in and out of the crevices of her molars, 
                more to prevent her returning to her litany of woes than in any 
                particular desire for dental knowledge.<p>
                &quot;Hi there, Twelve!&quot; she heard while Innocence was plugging 
                into her anus, now sufficiently lubricated with passion to take 
                any punishment. &quot;Got yet another new boyfriend.&quot;<p>
                Innocence looked up from where she'd buried her face in Twelve's 
                smooth face, and with her penis still hidden inside, to examine 
                Twelve's visitor. It was Twenty - one of Twelve's closer girlfriends 
                - dressed exactly like Twelve with black lipstick and eye shadow 
                and substantially fatter. Her stomach rolled over the leather 
                straps confining her vagina and her large nipples stuck out in 
                a kaleidoscope of lipsticked colours. Her shaved head was hidden 
                by a beret and she held a lit cigarette in her left hand.<p>
                &quot;Or girlfriend, I should say,&quot; corrected Twenty. &quot;Or 
                is it both. Are you into transsexuals, now, sweetest? And what 
                is she? Girl gone boy? Or boy gone girl? The operations must have 
                been fucking expensive!&quot;<p>
                Twelve twisted her body around and restrained Innocence while 
                ensuring her still erect penis was embedded deep inside her cunt. 
                She didn't feel like sharing Innocence with anyone! Innocence 
                probably wouldn't want to anyway. And she knew that given even 
                the slightest provocation, Twenty would get her fat surgery enhanced 
                lips right over Innocence's prick and suck out the last drop of 
                semen from it.<p>
                &quot;What the fuck do you want, Twenty darling?&quot; Twelve 
                asked friendlily. &quot;Whatever it is you're not fucking getting 
                it from Innocence here.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Innocence, is it? What a fucking wonderful name! You don't 
                get many with names like that in Congress. Is it a girl's name 
                or a boy's name?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Innocence is a girl. And always has been! She's never had 
                surgery or anything. She's always been like that!&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well, fuck me!&quot; exclaimed Twenty.<p>
                &quot;No she won't!&quot; retorted Twelve quickly. Then more diplomatically: 
                &quot;Unless you want to, Innocence love?&quot;<p>
                Innocence shook her head. It hadn't been that easy persuading 
                her to indulge with Twelve who'd been regularly making love to 
                Chastity recently, and Twelve knew that she wasn't one who readily 
                swapped partners. Also she flattered herself with some justification, 
                Twelve wasn't that bad looking even if the slightest bit of sun 
                got her peeling like a thin-skinned orange, whereas Twenty was 
                really not that attractive however much she'd managed to keep 
                abreast of the fashions.<p>
                &quot;So, what the fuck do you want, Twenty?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I just wanted to know if you wanted to come out. Nowhere 
                special mind. But somewhere.&quot;<p>
                Twelve quickly assented, knowing that this would provide Innocence 
                with the perfect excuse to stay and rest. She knew all that Innocence 
                really wanted was time to reflect and retire. As she predicted, 
                her friend showed no inclination at all in joining Twenty and 
                her in going to the night-clubs or wine bars of Congress. She 
                was quite happy curling herself into a naked ball under the ragged 
                blankets of Twelve's slim bed, while her hostess slipped on her 
                leather thongs and joined Twenty.<p>
                &quot;That's a fucking neat beret you've got,&quot; Twelve commented.<p>
                &quot;Yeah. Fucking great!&quot; sniffed Twenty nonchalantly. 
                &quot;They're all wearing them these days! You're not still wearing 
                a cunt stud, are you? Fuck me, girl! You'd better take it out 
                before we go anywhere. You don't want people to think you're some 
                kind of dildo dyke, do you?&quot;<p>
                Twelve had been away from the city too long, she could see. She 
                carefully removed the stud and left it on the cupboard, while 
                resolving to get a beret or similar as soon as possible. She felt 
                a little anxiety that her reputation might be irreparably damaged 
                if she were seen bare-headed. On the other hand, she felt sure 
                that the hats she had stuffed in her drawers from previous vacillations 
                of fashion wouldn't quite fit the bill satisfactorily. She blew 
                a kiss to Innocence's distraught and sad little face as she departed 
                with her arm around Twenty's waist, and the two departed jerking 
                their behinds - one taut and slim, and the other sagging uncomfortably 
                over bulky thighs.<p>
                Twelve felt pretty sure that Innocence wouldn't be happy for long 
                staying with her in her tiny bedsit and she was also fairly sure 
                that her own lifestyle would soon conflict very untidily with 
                what she knew of Innocence's while she had lived in Labia. She 
                racked her brains as to what she could do with her, and was convinced 
                she'd found a solution when she saw an advertisement in the local 
                newspaper announcing that her friend Honore L'Oeuf was visiting 
                the city. She felt sure that Innocence would get on well with 
                her authoress friend with the massive 80 inch bust. <p>
                So when Twelve had at last returned mid-afternoon from a long 
                night out in the night-clubs with Twenty and several other friends, 
                her eyes bleary, her crotch dripping with semen and lubricating 
                jelly and her thighs aching from dancing and fucking, she was 
                pleased to see Innocence quite enthusiastic at meeting such a 
                famous author. She hadn't actually read any of Honore L'Oeuf's 
                erotic children's stories, but she was familiar with the name. 
                Twelve had herself met Honore when she was still a child herself 
                - just on the edge of her teens and hungry for sex. Honore was 
                attracted to her young child's body with its smooth crotch and 
                the fashion in those days for children's clothes made her look 
                even younger than she was with her long hair in plaits and a flared 
                dress which revealed her lack of knickers underneath. It had been 
                the first time that Twelve had made love with an older woman, 
                and of course Honore couldn't have been much more than twenty 
                years old herself at the time. She still remembered with fondness 
                the passion of their lovemaking and the accuracy with which Honore 
                had identified the parts of her body which most enjoyed stimulation.<p>
                Twelve took Innocence to a Literary Festival that was being held 
                in the Congress City Hall where Honore L'Oeuf was addressing a 
                sold-out audience on the subject of sexuality, sexual abuse and 
                children where she was no doubt rehearsing her familiar argument 
                about the need for child erotica and how it did not imply at all 
                any encouragement for the sexual abuse of children by adults. 
                The hypocrite! commented Twelve to herself. Innocence and she 
                hadn't been able to buy any tickets so they waited until Honore 
                had finished her lecture before entering the lecture hall. <p>
                Honore's visit also coincided with the publication of a new book 
                that was on display in the foyer, and Twelve guessed that part 
                of her purpose in visiting the city was to publicise it. It was 
                called James and the Giant Penis, and featured the hero of the 
                hugely successful Willy Wanker and the Semen Factory in another 
                story of child related penis adventures. Twelve idly skimmed through 
                the pages of a copy that was underneath a display of the main 
                character struggling with an enormous penis almost as tall as 
                the boy himself and impossible to contain in any pair of trousers. 
                The pictures inside showed lucidly the problems that poor James 
                had with a penis that kept hitting people as it spurted into full 
                erection, the mess it made on carpets and the difficulty it had 
                in penetrating any orifice that wanted its attention. It did however 
                make James very popular with other girls and boys who took great 
                delight in playing with the penis and causing it to become embarrassingly 
                erect and took showers in the gobbets of semen it inevitably released.<p>
                The author herself was dressed in an enormous blouse which was 
                pulled in at her relatively slim waist, but didn't in any way 
                disguise the enormous swelling of her breasts against its fabric. 
                The buttons held onto each other with a desperation that looked 
                likely to fail every time her breast heaved with an exhalation 
                of breath. She wore a very plain navy blue skirt and stockings 
                and shoes. How drab! thought Twelve who had only that morning 
                bought herself a green beret that she proudly wore on her shaven 
                head. <p>
                When Twelve introduced Honore to Innocence she wasn't at all surprised 
                to see the way her eyes kept wandering back to the restrained 
                breasts. Honore was renting an apartment in the city for the weeks 
                that she was staying until returning to Brook. &quot;I feel so 
                much more at ease there!&quot; she said smiling, holding the massive 
                weight of her breasts in the palms of her hands. &quot;I don't 
                have to squeeze these things into totally inappropriate clothes. 
                But Twelve, you'd just feel so odd there. No fashions to follow. 
                And you look so divine at the moment. What a cute beret!&quot;<p>
                Innocence was dressed in just shorts and a tee-shirt. Twelve had 
                had no success at all in persuading her to shave off any more 
                hair than that which she was already taking off her legs and her 
                armpits. She also had no success in persuading her to wear one 
                of her older thongs or even to show her breasts. Innocence was 
                (let's face it!) rather dull really. However, it was clear to 
                her that Honore was attracted by Innocence's quite reserved character 
                and her physical beauty. &quot;Such a little beauty! The both 
                of you must come back to my apartment.&quot;<p>
                &quot;And there are hidden secrets in Innocence's knickers as 
                well!&quot; hinted Twelve as the three of them got into a taxi 
                with a young girl whom Honore had persuaded to come back with 
                her despite her mother's reservations. <p>
                &quot;What might those be?&quot; wondered Honore playfully, with 
                an arm around the small girl's shoulders and a hand burrowed inside 
                her blouse. <p>
                &quot;Wait and see!&quot;<p>
                Honore wasn't disappointed when they got back to her luxury apartment 
                and had insisted that everyone take their clothes off. &quot;It's 
                so uncomfortable otherwise!&quot; It had certainly been so for 
                Honore who divested her clothes with great relish, tearing off 
                several buttons from her capacious blouse. Twelve was pleased 
                to see that the massive breasts were showing no evidence of sagging 
                with age, and her enormous nipples were still as large as her 
                thumbs when erect which they soon were. The young girl was much 
                more embarrassed about taking off her clothes, revealing her total 
                lack of breasts or indeed of any adult features, but it was Innocence 
                who was the most embarrassed. Particularly, Twelve assumed, because 
                her wonderful penis was already throbbing with desire and would 
                take very little effort to become fully erect.<p>
                &quot;What a darling surprise!&quot; Honore gasped. &quot;Is it 
                real?&quot;<p>
                &quot;It's as real as your massive mammaries!&quot; Twelve remarked. 
                &quot;And produces much more milk!&quot;<p>
                Honore leaned a hand out and stroked the penis. As Twelve suspected 
                it immediately jumped to attention. &quot;Look at this, Six!&quot; 
                she said to the girl who was with them. &quot;Have you ever seen 
                anything like this before?&quot;<p>
                The girl shook her head shyly. &quot;Only on TV. And not so big 
                and stiff!&quot;<p>
                &quot;And talking of big and stiff...&quot; laughed Twelve holding 
                one of Honore's nipples. She bent her mouth over and applied it 
                to the mass of it. &quot;Come on, Six (is it?) Taste this!&quot;<p>
                Both Six and Innocence were soon persuaded to take turns on Honore's 
                prominent assets the nipples of which soon found themselves inside 
                Six's vagina and Innocence's anus. Then with the application of 
                some champagne that Honore had delivered by a very nervous maid 
                (who resolutely declined to accompany them in their lovemaking), 
                the four of them were soon indulging in some very frantic activity. 
                Twelve loved nibbling at Honore's breasts while Innocence hammered 
                frantically into her anus. She persuaded Honore, who only rarely 
                indulged in sex with penises, to accept Innocence's member first 
                into her vagina and then when her passion was greater into her 
                arse. She even managed to persuade little Six (with a little kind 
                assistance from Honore) to accept Innocence's penis, despite her 
                initial protests.<p>
                &quot;I can't do this! It's not right!&quot; <p>
                &quot;It is, if it's right for her!&quot; insisted Honore, as 
                Innocence's penis thrust deeper and deeper into the child's vagina 
                which betrayed its virginity with a release of blood and a few 
                cries of pain. &quot;Six won't be the first little girl whose 
                loss of virginity I've supervised.&quot; She looked at Innocence's 
                penis as it released semen over the child's smooth skin. &quot;Now 
                back inside me!&quot; she ordered, taking the penis before it 
                was finished and with an agility even Twelve would have thought 
                impossible for one with such large encumbrances swivelled her 
                body round to impale herself again on the length of it, her enormous 
                breasts hanging to either side of her relatively flat stomach.<p>
