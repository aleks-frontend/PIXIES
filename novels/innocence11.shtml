                In Which Mouse appreciates Innocence and her thespian ambitions 
                in equal measure; her performances help Kedi otherwise wedded 
                to Chastity; but she affirms greater affection for the virtues 
                of Innocence than those of Chastity. 
              <p>Mouse was passionately in love with Innocence, with a passion 
                that burst through her tee-shirt and swelled her breasts. She 
                could hardly bear to be parted a moment from her side. She loved 
                putting Innocence's gorgeous penis deep inside her mouth and allowing 
                it to brush against her tonsils. She loved holding it in her hand 
                and feeling it gradually grow from a tiny little acorn to a giant 
                oak in less than a minute. She loved having it deep inside her 
                cunt, while holding tightly onto the frame of the bed, and pushing 
                as hard as she could against it to force it to go as far inside 
                as it possibly could. <p>
                She missed the departure of Zipper with Chastity. She'd always 
                enjoyed sex with children. There was something about the slenderness 
                of their hips, the delicacy of their limbs, the androgynous flatness 
                of the chests and the hairlessness of their crotches that made 
                her feel very hot. She just wanted to engulf her face in their 
                crotches. But making love with Innocence was a full-time occupation. 
                How could someone with such a perfect female body have such a 
                perfect penis and at the same time be such a passionate lover? 
                It really exhausted her! <p>
                She hoped it didn't affect her work as an actress. In rehearsals, 
                she'd have to make love two or three times an hour and sometimes 
                in extremely awkward positions. It was quite irritating sometimes 
                that she'd have to accept frequent coitus interruptus as the director 
                would demand that she and whoever she was with (and there were 
                often more than one) should repeat a particular routine in a different 
                way. &quot;I don't think it's totally appropriate for you to bugger 
                Mouse in the first act. It may be appropriate in the last scene, 
                but I think no anal yet.&quot; Or he might say: &quot;A little 
                less crotch and more oral, Mouse, lovie!&quot; Or &quot;There's 
                something wrong with this scene. Perhaps if you did it doggy style. 
                And you'd better keep that scarf out of the way. Fling it off 
                if you must!&quot; <p>
                After all the rehearsals and when the play was on stage though, 
                Mouse didn't seem to notice the strain of frequent sex at all. 
                She might already be pretty exhausted from an hour or two of sex 
                with Innocence when she arrived at the theatre. She may still 
                have trickles of semen down her legs coming out of her vagina 
                at irregular intervals. But once she was in her role, she was 
                totally lost in her character. All she thought about was fitting 
                her sexual behaviour to her part and her lines. <p>
                Recently Mouse had mostly been working on sex farces, which involved 
                rather more sexual partners than in most plays compensated by 
                rather shorter sessions. Most sex farces like Keep Your Trousers 
                Up, Wave Your Willy, More Sex Please and Oh Bangkok! started with 
                a sex scene, followed by an embarrassment where partners revealed 
                their sexual jealousy, then a sequence of partner-swapping scenes 
                and then usually concluding with an orgy involving all the cast. 
                Mouse had built up a good reputation, and often took the lead 
                female role, - or one of the several lead roles. Sometimes the 
                role demanded lesbianism and it was soon recognised that Mouse 
                had a particular appetite and aptitude for these scenes. This 
                only increased her bankable value on most productions. <p>
                Early in her career, however, her penchant for children had almost 
                terminated it. It was one thing to masturbate children on stage 
                - this was recognised as being quite healthy and educational for 
                children. It was another thing to take up a relationship with 
                the leading child star especially if it was the director's child. 
                However Mouse's career was saved by her volunteering to share 
                the child with the director and by accepting a rather unpopular 
                role in a production of Titus Andronicus which required that she 
                get beaten quite brutally on stage every night. The bruises on 
                her face and the whip-lashes and blood on her back were, however, 
                she thought, an acceptable penalty to pay for continuing her thespian 
                ambitions. <p>
                When Mouse was on stage she would sometimes look out at the audience 
                at the men and women who were transfixed by her love- making. 
                She enjoyed the sounds of the audiences gasps as she put an actor's 
                erect penis all the way down her throat. She loved pulling out 
                things like letters, documents or weapons from inside her vagina 
                when the role demanded it and watching the audience's eyes widen 
                as it emerged. &quot;Here are the documents which the king demanded!&quot; 
                she would announce when the plastic bag containing them was only 
                halfway out. <p>
                Not all the parts gave her much pleasure though. A production 
                of The Toilet Lovers, a farce about people with excretion fixations 
                involved her peeing and shitting on stage and then pretending 
                to eat the turds of a fellow actor as he also shat on stage. Much 
                of this was actually faked, as neither she nor anyone else had 
                the required bowel control (nor the stomach for the smell and 
                taste of it), but she was so thoroughly into the role that she 
                could almost imagine the disgustingness of it. <p>
                She was currently appearing in a production of Henry IV, where 
                she played a whore of hitherto unsuspected significance in the 
                lives of not only the future Henry V but of Falstaff. Mouse loved 
                wearing the costume of this whore, which was apparently quite 
                authentic fourteenth century, being nothing at all except a cloak 
                to cover her in the streets. The costume designer had apparently 
                done a lot of research into the subject and had come to the conclusion 
                that fourteenth century whores lived in a world which so totally 
                accepted nudity that whores had no choice but to remain naked 
                all the time to attract any custom. However she had to wear very 
                thick make-up to make her face totally white and her eyebrows 
                were shaved off which gave her a quite startled aspect. <p>
                This looked especially strange when she was not at work. The fashion 
                now had moved to quite long dresses with a slit right up from 
                the ankle to the elastic waist which was hoisted just below the 
                breasts which were meant to be as full and voluptuous and unrestricted 
                as possible. The only jewellery she wore was an ethnic bracelet, 
                and she wore platform shoes that made her seem much taller than 
                she was. She was proud of her long hair, despite the pain it sometimes 
                caused her when she accidentally sat on it. This contrasted quite 
                dramatically with Innocence's hair which was now straight and 
                reached just over her collar. But then after being bald, Innocence 
                had a long way to go until her hair was as long as it had been 
                when Mouse first met her. <p>
                Innocence had become quite a frequent theatre-goer, - principally 
                of course just to see Mouse. As Mouse's recognised girlfriend, 
                she didn't have to pay the entrance fee and, simply sat in whichever 
                seats were still unsold or, if they were all sold, she'd sit in 
                the aisle in her long dress and her own beautiful breasts on display. 
                Mouse loved catching a glimpse of Innocence in the audience and 
                loved to acknowledge her encouraging smiles or her occasional 
                waves. <p>
                The most demanding aspect of her performance in Henry IV was having 
                to make love not once but three times to Falstaff. Mouse didn't 
                mind so much making love to Prince Hal. The actor playing him 
                was quite good and considerate at sex. He knew how sore a girl's 
                cunt could get and was able to make allowances for it. He also 
                appreciated how difficult it could sometimes be to utter your 
                lines while you were taking deep intakes of breath in your love-making. 
                The actor playing Falstaff wasn't so considerate, even in the 
                scene where Prince Hal and Falstaff joined together in an orgy 
                with all the other Cheapside characters. It was probably inevitable 
                that an actor chosen to play a fat, slovenly, boastful and cowardly 
                character such as Falstaff should have some of the characteristics 
                himself. Mouse didn't appreciate having a mouthful of his bad 
                breath, gin-smell and cigar-smoke as Falstaff's tongue went deep 
                inside her mouth. She didn't like the smell of his farts which 
                always erupted just before he was about to ejaculate. And she 
                especially didn't like trying to gasp out her lines while his 
                bulk collapsed on her substantially smaller body. <p>
                Innocence was aware of all this, and showered Mouse with kisses 
                after the performance after she'd taken her make-up off and wiped 
                off the semen from her crotch and mouth with a handkerchief. After 
                the performance, the two would often rush off to a night-club 
                not so much for the dancing and drugs, but more as a way for Mouse 
                to work off her discomfort. She was definitely looking forward 
                to the end of the run for Henry IV. The next play to be performed, 
                however, was very likely going to be The Tempest. She hoped that 
                the role of Caliban wouldn't be played by the same character as 
                was playing Falstaff. Even if he was though, the sex scene with 
                Caliban came very early in the play and was thankfully rather 
                brief. Most of the time, the naked Miranda made love with only 
                a Ferdinand shipwrecked naked on the island, although the naked 
                Ariel indulged in a bit of oral sex with her. The Tempest was 
                famous as a play of almost total nudity, where only Prospero seemed 
                capable of retaining more than the most tenuous grip on clothing. 
                <p>
                Mouse was quite pleased with her body, and had no reservations 
                about displaying it on stage. However, her full breasts which 
                were sometimes an asset, - especially for the viewing advantage 
                of people in the rear seats - did mean that certain roles that 
                demanded actresses of fairly flat breasts were forever denied 
                her, such as Peter Pan, Prince Charming and Joan of Arc. <p>
                Mouse wasn't the only performer sharing the flat with Innocence 
                and her sister. Kedi also made a living on stage, but in a very 
                different capacity to Mouse. Her performances were, in any case, 
                on a regular work routine according to a peculiar shift rota with 
                some opportunity for overtime. She was working at a sex show where 
                for half an hour every two hours or so she would take the stage 
                to perform her act which was of her own design and varied only 
                according to the time of day or the day of the week. She no longer 
                needed to make a living by masturbating in the street - and indeed 
                more liberal employment laws regarding ethnic employment now meant 
                that she could actually earn more through regular employment than 
                she'd used to earn from a day on the street. <p>
                Mouse and Innocence often went out with Chastity to see Kedi's 
                act at the Teddy Bear, - partly to keep Chastity company but partly 
                because as friends of one of the star turns the girls usually 
                got all their drinks free. The atmosphere of the Teddy Bear was 
                totally different from the Queen Elizabeth Theatre. For a start, 
                most people were only partly engaged in the performance. Many 
                would continue their conversations irrespective of what was happening 
                on stage - a rudeness that Mouse could never have borne herself. 
                There you are, baring your soul and usually a great deal more, 
                and being treated like wallpaper! The other main difference is 
                that instead of being lined up in rows with all eyes directed 
                towards the stage, the seating here was around tables where the 
                clients would be drinking wine or beer and sometimes eating, and 
                the music continued almost constantly. Only occasionally did an 
                act require very much in the way of dialogue or monologue, and 
                generally the music was only broken by the compere - one of a 
                series of fat men with very loud suits and greasy long hair - 
                to announce the next act. <p>
                &quot;From the darkest Jungles! From the lands of Cannibals, Tigers 
                and Giraffes! Away from the Steaming Cauldrons and the Teeming 
                Starvation Camps! We have our very own Jungle Bunny! Our own Royal 
                Coon! Princess Pussy!&quot; <p>
                Kedi's stage title was indeed Princess Pussy, and she was in the 
                very privileged position of being the only black artiste in a 
                club where the others were either white or oriental. Generally, 
                black sex performers had to work at the seedier clubs like the 
                Black Cock or the Red Windmill or the Deep Throat Kitten. In those 
                places, as Mouse had found out, all the acts were black (although 
                not many of the audience were) and the acts often included potential 
                or pretend self-mutilation. The girls and the men in those establishments 
                were required to perform to a high degree of sexual humiliation, 
                and men in the audience were often invited to come on stage to 
                fuck the performers or even to piss on them. Princess Pussy's 
                act however was nothing as coarse as that. <p>
                As an actress, Mouse had a great deal of respect for Kedi's act. 
                She knew how difficult it was to put so many such large things 
                inside her cunt and to produce them with the correct theatrical 
                relish. She also appreciated the problems of keeping some of them 
                in there after her Chocolate Sandwich routine, which meant being 
                fucked by two white men at once, and still have them ready to 
                pull out afterwards. Half an hour is a long time to continue a 
                sex act, and to provide sufficient variety to keep the act going. 
                And also providing enough interest after the other acts which 
                had already sated most of the audience's appetite for watching 
                fucking, masturbating, buggery, oral sex or audience participation. 
                Kedi didn't even, as some turns did, enliven her act with a monologue 
                to focus interest more fully. <p>
                The art of Kedi's act, Mouse was sure, was to broadcast her broad 
                grin at all stages which somehow made it all seem much more enjoyable 
                than it might have been. She kept her grin going even after inserting 
                her finger all the way up her anus, withdrawing it and licking 
                it. Mouse knew from experience that this often didn't taste at 
                all nice however good your personal hygiene, and to do that so 
                often required a stomach that Mouse wasn't sure she had. <p>
                When Henry IV finished, the Queen Elizabeth Theatre was closed 
                by the Local Council for a couple of weeks for redecoration, and 
                in that time Mouse had an enforced unpaid holiday in which neither 
                she nor anyone else could even begin rehearsals for the next production 
                - which indeed was going to be The Tempest, and in which Mouse 
                was definitely taking the role of Miranda. As expected the actor 
                who played Falstaff was going to play Caliban in this production, 
                but she was pleased to find that the one who'd played Prince Hal 
                was going to take on the role of Ferdinand. But in the meantime, 
                Mouse found herself in a kind of acting hiatus. <p>
                &quot;I feel so empty when I'm not performing!&quot; she complained 
                while sitting in the living room with Kedi and Innocence. <p>
                &quot;If you are liking I'll bring you into my act at the Teddy 
                Bear,&quot; suggested Kedi. &quot;Are you wanting that?&quot; 
                <p>
                Mouse wasn't sure. Sex shows weren't theatre, however much skill 
                they involved. &quot;Do you think I'd be any good at it.&quot; 
                <p>
                &quot;I have saw you many times at the theatre,&quot; Kedi remarked. 
                &quot;I am certain that you will be perfect.&quot; <p>
                Mouse was still unconvinced, but she sat with Kedi and discussed 
                what sort of things she could do that would be suitable for an 
                act with Princess Pussy. They determined that they would have 
                a double lesbian act, and would replace the Chocolate Sandwich 
                routine with Mouse and Kedi using a double-ended dildo in each 
                other's cunt simultaneously. It would also rest Kedi's anus which 
                had got a bit painful after being penetrated at least four times 
                every day. Mouse wasn't too sure that she fancied having things 
                pulled out of her cunt of quite the dimensions that Kedi did, 
                but she was shown the techniques that were used to make it more 
                comfortable. For instance, the yards of coloured ribbon that she 
                pulled out early in her act was in fact stored in a matchbox, 
                which she would surreptitiously replace with others during the 
                act when the lights dimmed. <p>
                The two discussed the Saturday night Princess Pussy act which 
                was an hour long and involved audience participation. Kedi demonstrated 
                that the art was to stretch out the oral section with the members 
                of the audience and then get them to come as quickly as possible 
                inside them. With the two of them, it would be possible to restrict 
                the numbers of guest participants to less than five in the half 
                hour allocated. <p>
                Mouse was more nervous than she'd ever been on stage before when 
                she appeared with Kedi as Princess Pussy and the Clitoris Cat. 
                Her role involved her contrasting Kedi's total nudity by dressing 
                in a theatrical cat-mask with whiskers (also very much in contrast 
                to her name) and putting a long furry tail deep inside her anus. 
                Otherwise she wore nothing except a collar round her neck which 
                Kedi attached to a chain. <p>
                Their act extended on Kedi's own with a little twist relying on 
                preserving the fantasy of Mouse being a cat. Part of this involved 
                Kedi pulling at the tail that Mouse had rolled up in her arse 
                which served to not only show that it was in her anus but illustrated 
                it being of a rather improbable length. Mouse found herself genuinely 
                enjoying the sex with Kedi. It was not often that stage sex gave 
                her genuine pleasure, but Kedi was a friend and an occasional 
                lover and this meant that she showed a tenderness that most of 
                her co-stars were not really capable of. As the two of them leaned 
                back on their shoulders with the double-ended dildo (all twenty-four 
                inches of it!) deep inside the two of them, Mouse couldn't help 
                but look out at the table where Innocence and Chastity were sitting. 
                <p>
                There they were, holding hands together and wishing the best for 
                their respective lovers. Mouse smiled to herself, and then in 
                a sudden spasm of real passion she arched herself onto Kedi, causing 
                the dildo to pop out suddenly in the abrupt motion and showered 
                Kedi with kisses. Kedi started and flashed an expression of real 
                annoyance. Mouse smiled apologetically. She then returned to her 
                previous position, forcing the dildo up her much moistened cunt 
                and returned to her exertions with renewed vigour as if the unscripted 
                action hadn't happened at all. It didn't do to be making love 
                for yourself. As a professional, you had to think of the pleasure 
                of the audience. Not your own pleasure. Even if the two did sometimes 
                coexist.<p>
                Mouse wasn't sure what her real feelings were towards Chastity, 
                although she'd often made love with her, along with everyone else. 
                She was a much more demanding lover than the other two girls - 
                certainly more so than Innocence - and not nearly as tender towards 
                her. However, when Chastity mentioned an opportunity to make love 
                with a child, Mouse's interest perked up quite considerably. As 
                a result of her experience with Zipper and his friends, Chastity 
                had developed quite a passion for children - but opportunities 
                didn't really happen that often. However, at the moment she was 
                working at a shop in a stately home and had struck up a friendship 
                with one of the black cleaning-women - all the menial jobs were 
                done by black women - who had a young eleven year old daughter. 
                Chastity had been working on this woman, Fare, for long time and 
                at long last she'd arranged to have an evening at her place with 
                her daughter, Ayi. <p>
                Mouse was immediately suspicious. &quot;How do you know there'll 
                be any sex?&quot; <p>
                &quot;My relationship with Fare hasn't been totally innocent.&quot; 
                <p>
                &quot;I mean with Ayi ...&quot; <p>
                &quot;Fare knows what to expect.&quot; <p>
                &quot;But does Ayi?&quot; wondered Mouse, but Chastity wasn't 
                going to elaborate. She wasn't a girl not to share her pleasures 
                with her friends though, which was why she'd mentioned it to Mouse. 
                Innocence apparently wasn't too keen on the idea. &quot;She's 
                a bit of a prude, really!&quot; Chastity commented. &quot;I blame 
                it on that bloody convent.&quot; Kedi had also declined, and gave 
                no reason, but Mouse got the feeling that she somehow disapproved 
                of Chastity's scheming with her work-mates. Perhaps she felt, 
                as Mouse did but didn't really care, that in some way Fare and 
                Ayi were being manipulated by Chastity. <p>
                Certainly, Chastity insisted that the two girls dress somewhat 
                more conservatively than they would normally do. Rather more like 
                she would dress at the Stately Home - covering both her crotch 
                and breasts with a simple smock-like dress and wearing tidy little 
                sandals. Fare's home was in a poor quarter of the town, which 
                was badly lit by street-lamps and with streets prominently littered 
                with ancient and broken-down cars. Her own home was a flat in 
                a quite narrow terrace, with a front door patched up by cardboard 
                and no evidence of having been painted for a very long time. There 
                was no response to the door-bell, and Mouse was feeling quite 
                nervous as she stood on this strange door-step watching shadowy 
                black figures go by. Despite her love and affection for Kedi, 
                she still had a kind of prejudice for black people which was quite 
                common throughout Wonderground, despite all the recent reforms. 
                She still feared these foreboding black figures. <p>
                &quot;I reckon the door-bell's out of order!&quot; commented Chastity 
                who started banging the letter-box. This seemed to work far better, 
                and soon there was a hurrying sound as a light came on in the 
                hall-way and a dark shadow started fumbling with a complex of 
                locks and keys. Then the door opened and a small black woman - 
                shorter even than Mouse - in her late thirties wearing an apron 
                and a quite smart but rather faded dress stood in front of them. 
                She grinned in a way that was reminiscent of Kedi, but otherwise 
                had a somewhat less prepossessing or dominant appearance. In comparison 
                to Fare, it was obvious why Kedi was such an exceptional and attractive 
                woman. <p>
                She was very friendly however, and giggled in a quite girlish 
                way after Chastity greeted her with a very deep kiss that plunged 
                straight down her throat and clearly took her by surprise. She 
                blushed in a way that was still visible through her very dark 
                skin, and fussed rather unnecessarily with her apron. &quot;You 
                must being Mouse,&quot; she said looking at her. Mouse nodded 
                feeling very embarrassed, but appreciated nonetheless the way 
                in which Fare had obviously worked to make her poky little flat 
                look as attractive as possible. There were many cheap posters 
                on the slightly faded and stained wallpaper, probably to cover 
                the worst stains. The furniture was sparse and battered, and the 
                floor was covered by a montage of carpets and rugs. In the corner 
                of the room however, and sitting very quietly and looking very 
                apprehensive, was a little girl in a very innocent school-girl 
                outfit. Mouse looked towards her and smiled welcomingly. Very 
                shyly and quite briefly, the girl responded in kind. <p>
                &quot;This is my daughter, Ayi,&quot; Fare said very proudly. 
                &quot;I hope you will being kind to her. She have never been touched 
                before.&quot; <p>
                &quot;Don't you worry, Fare,&quot; said Chastity, kissing her 
                full on the mouth. &quot;Mouse is an expert at this sort of thing. 
                Aren't you?&quot; <p>
                Mouse frowned apprehensively at this statement. What was Chastity 
                up to? <p>
                &quot;Now, take your clothes off, Fare,&quot; advised Chastity, 
                &quot;and be patient while Mouse initiates your daughter.&quot; 
                Mouse raised an eyebrow quizzically. &quot;Go on, Mouse, show 
                how the young are initiated in our culture. Show Fare how natural 
                it is.&quot; Fare smiled sadly at Mouse, while she took her clothes 
                off totally and stood naked in front of Chastity who remained 
                clothed. Mouse was still unsure what was meant of her. There was 
                clearly some deception going on, using Fare's ignorance of local 
                custom, but Mouse didn't know what was required of her. Indeed, 
                she was feeling extremely sorry for Fare and her little daughter, 
                being victims of such blatant manipulation. <p>
                She walked over to Ayi, who, probably from prompting from her 
                mother behind Mouse, stood up from the chair where she'd been 
                sitting and looked up pensively at Mouse. The next thing to do, 
                felt Mouse, was to get to a less threatening position, so she 
                knelt down in front of Ayi, so that the little girl was taller 
                than her. &quot;Where shall I begin?&quot; she asked herself. 
                She turned her head round to look at Chastity for guidance, and 
                felt almost shocked to see her already running her tongue over 
                Fare's naked black body and forcing her fingers up her vagina. 
                Ayi was looking as apprehensively at her mother and her lover 
                as she was at Mouse. <p>
                &quot;It's alright, Ayi dear,&quot; said Mouse in the practised 
                voice of one who'd seduced younger girls before - although not 
                in such settings before. She put her fingers to the top button 
                of Ayi's blouse and felt a spasm of fear run through her small 
                body. Mouse leant forward and gave Ayi a tender kiss on the lips, 
                and then proceeded to undo more buttons. Slowly, and with frequent 
                tender caresses and kisses, Mouse undid all Ayi's clothes, revealing 
                the young painfully slender and smooth black body beneath. Eventually 
                she had all Ayi's clothes off, and the girl was standing naked 
                in front of her still looking very nervous. <p>
                Stage two, thought Mouse, in her experienced way, as she relished 
                the beauty of the child's body. She then concentrated her tongue 
                around the top of the thighs and her flat stomach, gradually working 
                towards the girl's crotch. She then gradually guided the naked 
                child back onto a sofa so that she could be in a more comfortable 
                position. Gradually, and with coaxing, the girl became more relaxed 
                and even seemed to begin enjoying herself. Stage three came next, 
                Mouse said to herself, as the caressing and kissing became more 
                physical and active. Ayi started gasping with a new-found set 
                of physical feelings she'd never had before. <p>
                What Mouse hadn't suspected was that there'd be a further stage 
                after bringing herself to orgasm - which rather frightened the 
                girl who was not used to the full-throated cries of an aroused 
                woman nor of the peculiar thrusting body movements and spasms 
                - and bringing Ayi as close to arousal as it was possible for 
                a girl of that age to come. This further stage was when she found 
                herself joined in the love-making by Chastity. She flashed an 
                inquisitive and slightly angry glance at Chastity. &quot;Is this 
                really right?&quot; she whispered, as Ayi trembled under the new 
                unaccustomed intensity of sexual arousal. <p>
                Chastity smiled at Mouse in a way that seemed both smug and dispassionate. 
                &quot;I don't think Fare would complain, do you?&quot; Mouse turned 
                her head round to see why this might be so, and saw that Chastity 
                had somehow tied Ayi's mother up with ropes to a chair, with her 
                hands tied behind it, her legs to the chair-legs, a handkerchief 
                tied around her mouth and head, and her crotch wide open with 
                what looked like a carrot protuding out of her vagina. Mouse didn't 
                want to alarm Ayi, but she felt very unsure of herself. Still 
                keeping her hands stroking Ayi's tender little bottom, Mouse put 
                her mouth to Chastity's ear. &quot;Did she consent?&quot; <p>
                Mouse suddenly felt one of Chastity's fingers enter her own vagina. 
                &quot;Shh! Lover. Don't worry about her. She's enjoying every 
                minute of it!&quot; Chastity's reassurance put Mouse in an uneasy 
                and, she felt, self-deceiving state of acceptance, which allowed 
                her to go along with Chastity's games. These involved pursuing 
                rather more vigorous sex with Ayi than she might otherwise have 
                considered. She was quite aware that the girl would feel a lot 
                of discomfort and possibly pain around her crotch and anus, and 
                even the mouth which Chastity kissed rather vigorously. Although 
                the child had got rather intoxicated on their love-making she'd 
                soon see things a little differently later. <p>
                The games the girls played with Fare must have required a lot 
                of consent on her behalf, Mouse felt, but she pretended to herself 
                that Chastity had arranged this before, but significantly she 
                didn't feel inclined to take the handkerchief out of Fare's mouth. 
                Fare was entered and entertained in many devious ways, until Chastity 
                felt she was sufficiently exhausted and freed her from her ropes. 
                Although, Fare seemed uncomplaining afterwards, there was a somewhat 
                troubled expression on her face, and not a little haste as she 
                guided the two girls out of the front door. <p>
                &quot;Do you think she'll invite us back?&quot; laughed an indefatigable 
                Chastity as they left. Mouse didn't say anything, and wasn't sure 
                at this stage if she even liked Chastity at all. However, she 
                was Innocence's sister. <p>
