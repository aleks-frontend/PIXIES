              <p>During the first couple of days on the island, there was absolutely no doubt 
                in my mind that Pamela was the one woman I had been searching 
                for my entire life. She had the whole package - beauty and brains, 
                a friendly demeanor, and total kindness and consideration for 
                others.<p>
                I fully believed that my ultimate fantasy woman had stepped into 
                reality - right before my very eyes.<p>
                However, those thoughts quickly changed once I became more involved 
                with Amy, who replaced Pamela as my ultimate fantasy. Amy was 
                a different type of fantasy, though. As the only true and bona-fide 
                slut on the island, Amy invoked the idea of an insatiable porn 
                star stepping into my life.<p>
                Not only could the 27-year-old NOT be slowed down when it came 
                to sex, but it was virtually impossible to give Amy any type of 
                erotic gratification or fulfillment, either. Her slopey-eyed, 
                been-there-done-that look suggested that no matter what you tried 
                with her, Amy had not only done it before, but she could easily 
                handle it as well.<p>
                Her go-for-it attitude and zest for sexual play really appealed 
                to me. Amy's recent history in Ohio, where she lived - with gang-bangs, 
                orgies and strangers all mixed together, was ample proof of her 
                limitless boundaries.<p>
                The red-head was the type of woman who, if married to me, would 
                be far from a faithful wife. A &quot;night out with the girls&quot; 
                would surely involve the use of dildos. Amy would have affairs 
                with other men and co-workers alike. As her husband, I would have 
                to accept that - and deal with it.<p>
                Perhaps it was the voyeur in me, but I found the thought of having 
                such an insatiable slut as my wife suited me well. Until I really 
                started to think about it, that is...<p>
                It wasn't too long after my initial fascination with Amy that 
                my attention had diverted itself toward sweet, little Lindsay. 
                The 18-year-old was everything which most older men can only lust 
                and dream about. With a tight body and a tender, wholesome face, 
                Lindsay appeared more like she was 15 or 16, instead of her actual 
                age. She was the neighbor's flirtatious daughter come to life...<p>
                Better described as a cheerleader sweetheart, Lindsay exuded innocence 
                and everything which was right about young women her age. She 
                was caring and considerate, sweet and kind... friendly and very 
                respectful.<p>
                Best of all, however, was that Lindsay had a sexual desire within 
                her that could one day even exceed Amy's. It had been awakened 
                and brought to the forefront during our first three weeks here 
                on the island.<p>
                Of course, my attention did not stay solely focused upon Lindsay 
                for too long. Soon, both her and Amy were foremost in my dreams. 
                Which one did I want more? The veteran slut, or the possible slut-in-waiting? 
                The edgy, experienced look of Amy... or the tender innocence of 
                Lindsay?<p>
                Perhaps one reason why I flip-flopped between Amy and Lindsay 
                so easily was because they were what could best be classified 
                as &quot;extreme fantasies&quot; for me. They were real, yes. 
                But were they what I really wanted in life?<p>
                Did I want to have a woman (Amy) who looked like she had just 
                stepped off of a porn-movie set? Did I want my wife or girlfriend 
                to be out until the wee hours of the morning, seducing strangers? 
                Did I want someone who could not be controlled or harnessed? It 
                was a nice fantasy, indeed... but perhaps best left as a fantasy.<p>
                On the other hand... did I want a &quot;tight little teen&quot; 
                in my life? Did I want someone so light-headed and immature that 
                until reaching the island, Lindsay knew next to nothing about 
                pleasures of the flesh? She would learn, of course... but did 
                I want to go along for the ride with her?<p>
                Much like having a woman who resembled a porn star coming into 
                my life, the idea of corrupting an innocent teen-ager was very 
                appealing. But it too, was best left as a fantasy.<p>
                Only adding to the fantasy appeal was that one day, as I said, 
                Lindsay may even exceed Amy on the slut scale. Then, she could 
                not be controlled or harnessed either.<p>
                So what exactly DID I want? My initial hope for the island this 
                summer was to find a woman so enticing and tempting that I could 
                entertain thoughts of marrying her.<p>
                Being a rich man such as myself has its drawbacks. I find it extremely 
                hard to first find, and then maintain a relationship with a woman. 
                If they are not just after me for my money, it seems, I at least 
                have the suspicion that they are. It makes things incredibly difficult. 
                Plus, I have never been a very trusting person to begin with.<p>
                But with the island, I at least had the chance to bring a group 
                of beautiful women together who appealed to me, albeit in various 
                ways. With my voyeur room, I could watch them in their private 
                moments and eavesdrop on their conversations about not only me, 
                but each other, and general life as well.<p>
                Maybe, just maybe... I could finally find the woman who would 
                turn out to be the soul-mate I have long yearned for. I had a 
                total of ten weeks to evaluate all of the women and determine 
                which one was right for me... if any of them were.<p>
                Although the girls knew I had money, they were not after me for 
                it. Sure... they were overly curious about the big $500,000 payout 
                at the end of the summer. That was human nature on their part.<p>
                But the girls weren't after me for my money. Right now... they 
                wanted literally nothing but sex from me.<p>
                During the summer, I had the sincere hope that I would completely 
                fall for one of these ladies - and vice versa. That was the whole 
                idea of the island in the first place. Maybe I could find that 
                one special lady, go past the sexual play with her... and then 
                the two of us find love together.<p>
                But who did I want? The realization hit me all of a sudden that 
                Amy and Lindsay were not the ones for me. I thought of both of 
                them more like play-things instead of actual people... and that 
                was not a good thing when trying to start a life-long relationship.<p>
                I needed a woman who would not only stimulate my body, but my 
                mind as well.<p>
                I found that woman upon opening my eyes in the morning.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>Pamela looked very divine and peaceful as she lay next to me 
                in bed, her eyes closed as she lounged quietly in the land of 
                dreams. Her face appeared so content and beautiful;<p>
                I could not help but to reach out and graze it with my hand. She 
                roused for a moment at the touch, but continued sleeping even 
                as I then pecked her lips with a whispery kiss.<p>
                I knew it before, got sidetracked for awhile... but now was on 
                the right path once again. Pamela was who I wanted!<p>
                Pamela was a goddess who could light up the darkest room with 
                her mere presence alone. She was young, blonde, extremely shapely 
                and wondrously beautiful. As I gazed at her angelic face while 
                she slept away, I knew the woman I had long since dreamed about 
                was right there in front of me.<p>
                But it wasn't all about the way Pamela looked. She was such a 
                warm and friendly person. It was obvious to me that Pamela enjoyed 
                the company of everyone who was around her. She didn't come across 
                as being conceited at all - much unlike the great majority of 
                gorgeous women her age. She was very kind and considerate person 
                who cared for others.<p>
                Pamela was also a very intelligent and sharp-witted woman as well. 
                That was obvious from her own suspicions about me, which she discussed 
                last night before we had sex with each other. I liked that quality 
                a lot.<p>
                A couple of years ago, I would have instantly thought that any 
                woman who was employed as an exotic dancer was an automatic slut. 
                I wouldn't even need to think a second thought about it. But Pamela... 
                she wasn't a slut.<p>
                Despite her dancing career - which she was only involved in to 
                have enough money to get through college - Pamela was far from 
                a slut. She wasn't an angel either, mind you.<p>
                Pamela was somewhere in the happy medium between angel and slut 
                that I found appealed to me very, very much. She was very adventurous 
                and willing to try new things... but would always be smart about 
                it. Pamela, in fact, was smart about everything in life. She had 
                it ALL together.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>I could not help myself as even while Pamela continued sleeping, 
                I began to splay gentle kisses and licks all over the 25-year-old's 
                lovely face. This roused her awake, but it did not matter. I continued 
                kissing her.<p>
                &quot;Wh-What are you doing?&quot; came her sleepy, morning voice.<p>
                &quot;Cherishing you,&quot; I sighed as my mouth covered all areas<p>
                of her face - at random.<p>
                Pamela moaned and shifted around on the bed. She let out a soft 
                giggle and placed both hands upon my head, cradling it while offering 
                my shoulder a gentle kiss in return. &quot;You must be in a romantic 
                mood this morning, huh?&quot; Having just come out of a long sleep, 
                her words were still garbled.<p>
                &quot;I love you Pamela,&quot; was my heartfelt statement as I 
                continued peppering her face with kiss after whispery kiss.<p>
                &quot;I thought you loved Amy and Lindsay,&quot; she countered, 
                still holding my head with both hands.<p>
                &quot;No...&quot; I said, switching to her neck. &quot;I love 
                you. I realized that between last night and this morning.&quot; 
                I pulled back for a moment and gazed into her eyes, before planting 
                a kiss upon her lips. &quot;I want us to be together.&quot;<p>
                Pamela looked at me with an insightful expression upon her lovely 
                face for quite some time. However, it eventually loosened up, 
                and then she offered me a charming smile.<p>
                &quot;I love you too, Jeremy.&quot;<p>
                The bombshell blonde placed both of her arms around my neck and 
                shoulders, then pulled my mouth down to hers for a blissful kiss. 
                We traded our tongues over an open-mouthed exchange, each swiping 
                the others' mouth with great feeling and intensity. This was where 
                I wanted to be...<p>
                &quot;Will you do me a favor, Pamela?&quot;<p>
                &quot;What?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Dance for me,&quot; I replied, almost begging her. This, 
                of<p>
                course, was something that I had wanted from Pamela since I spied 
                on her giving Amy a lap dance three weeks ago.<p>
                &quot;Now?&quot; she countered, surprised. &quot;I'm in no shape 
                to dance. I just woke up... my hair is all messed up, I'm not 
                dressed for it, my make-up is...&quot;<p>
                &quot;I don't care,&quot; I said, interrupting her. &quot;You 
                look perfectly fine the way you are. I don't need an image or 
                a Barbie doll to dance for me, Pamela. The way you look now is 
                perfectly fine.&quot; I paused and added, &quot;Please?&quot;<p>
                Pamela offered me yet another insightful expression before nodding 
                her head and slowly getting out of the bed. Her long-flowing blonde 
                hair and facial mascara in complete ruins due to not only the 
                night of sleep, but our torrid round of sex beforehand, Pamela 
                still looked stunning to me.<p>
                After all... she was completely, and gloriously nude.<p>
                When I sat up on the edge of the bed, Pamela started to dance 
                for me. Swaying her hips and tilting her head to all sides, she 
                ran both hands up and down her full breasts while offering me 
                a luscious smile. I returned it with one of my own as our eyes 
                spoke silent words of devotion to each other.<p>
                The blonde goddess closed the distance between us and began to 
                undulate her magnificent body against mine. Still in a constant 
                rocking and swaying motion, Pamela nodded her head as I reached 
                out and grazed her hip and thigh.<p>
                I growled with desire as Pamela encircled my neck with both arms, 
                only to then grind her breasts upon my face. As her body continued 
                to churn and undulate to a silent rhythm, mine began to move in 
                response to her. At the same time, my cock first began to twitch 
                - and then grow rapidly.<p>
                Using her hands, Pamela moved my head away from her breasts - 
                downward, toward her midriff. Indulging myself in the wondrous 
                scent and immaculate beauty of her body, my imagination began 
                to run wild. The image of Pamela in a wedding dress, walking down 
                the aisle, made me smile...<p>
                The professional stripper brought my face back to her breasts, 
                squishing it there. I moaned in response, then heard Pamela giggle 
                as she straddled my lap and took a seat. Her hands grazed my bare 
                chest and stomach before she used one to gently tease my pulsating 
                erection.<p>
                Shifting positions once again, Pamela stood up and moved a thigh 
                between my legs and rubbed it hard upon my shaft. My breathing 
                was becoming a bit labored and intense as the excitement level 
                within me was increasing rapidly. All the while, Pamela's voluptuous 
                body continued to buck and churn against mine in a sensual, erotic 
                dancing motion.<p>
                Unable to take anymore of this sweet torture, I grabbed Pamela 
                by the shoulders and threw her down upon the bed beneath me. She 
                giggled in response as I first pinned her wrists to the mattress, 
                before smashing my mouth upon hers for a very heated and passionate 
                kiss.<p>
                Our tongues went wild upon one another as Pamela brought both 
                arms around my shoulders and embraced me hard. We rolled over 
                on the bed, with her now on top of me. Then, we rolled back to 
                the original position. I held Pamela's shoulders down and kissed 
                her with all the fervor I could.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>Suddenly, I got a rush of risky courage in my mind. At this point 
                in time, it seemed as though I could do no wrong when Pamela was 
                involved. If she was indeed going to be my soul-mate in life, 
                Pamela needed to know everything about me.<p>
                &quot;Can you keep a secret?&quot; I asked in a breathless tone, 
                after breaking the kiss.<p>
                &quot;Of course I can,&quot; was her reply. &quot;I love secrets!&quot;<p>
                &quot;I really mean it,&quot; I told her. &quot;It's a big secret. 
                You<p>
                can't tell any of the other girls about this.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I promise!&quot; she countered with a grin. &quot;I won't 
                tell anyone.&quot; Her eyes flashed as she reiterated, &quot;I 
                PROMISE!&quot;<p>
                I have no idea where this source of energy was coming from. Nevertheless, 
                I found myself getting out of the bed and extending my hand toward 
                Pamela. She took it, then I pulled her off of the bed and into 
                a standing position.<p>
                &quot;A big secret...&quot; I said while escorting her over to 
                the far wall, her hand entwined lovingly with mine.<p>
                Pamela looked confused as I turned the wood-carved tiki decoration 
                which was part of the wall. It caused a noise - something within 
                the wall, Pamela must have thought to herself. Now, she was even 
                more confused.<p>
                Still holding her hand, I then took a few steps to the left and 
                punched in a set of numbers upon the small security keypad there. 
                Pamela's beautiful eyes grew big as the wall in front of her suddenly 
                opened up.<p>
                &quot;Welcome to my secret,&quot; I said, extending my other hand 
                and motioning for her to step into the voyeur room.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>Inside the voyeur room, of course, was a spread of large television 
                screens, each of them focusing upon a different room in the mansion 
                - or place on the island.<p>
                Since they were all hooked up to motion detectors, only a couple 
                of monitors were displaying activity. I smiled at the sight as 
                in room two, Lisa and Torrie were locked in a tender embrace as 
                they kissed each other. Room three showed Lindsay and Trish, as 
                they lounged together, engaged deep in conversation. Meanwhile 
                in the kitchen, Amy was talking to Christina about something.<p>
                &quot;Last night you were intent on finding out my so-called secret,&quot; 
                I said to Pamela, as she looked at the monitors in shocked silence. 
                &quot;What exactly is it that I do all day long while you and 
                the other girls are out having fun... correct?&quot;<p>
                I waited for a response, but did not get one. Pamela just continued 
                staring at the monitors in silence. Thus, I decided to step forward 
                and flip the audio switch for room two. Sounds of gentle passion 
                could be heard as Lisa and Torrie continued forth with their mutual 
                embrace and kiss.<p>
                &quot;Welcome to my voyeur room,&quot; I said to Pamela, still 
                waiting for a response but not getting one. &quot;I've always 
                been one who enjoys to watch...&quot;<p>
                Several seconds later, Pamela was still silent. However, once 
                there was an &quot;Oh God...&quot; from Lisa as Torrie retrieved 
                one of her massive strap-on dildos, Pamela suddenly turned her 
                face toward mine and looked at me.<p>
                I offered her a smile, still waiting for a reaction. I finally 
                got one... but not exactly the type I wanted.<p>
                The blank expression upon Pamela's face tightened as she extended 
                her right arm, her hand open. She let out a grunt and before I 
                knew what happened next, Pamela had slapped me across the face 
                - as hard as she possibly could.<p>
                &quot;HOW DARE YOU SPY ON US!&quot; she exploded, her eyes flashing 
                with absolute anger.<p>
                Both stunned and hurt, I tilted my head to the side while holding 
                my burning face. Perhaps I should have kept the voyeur room a 
                secret from her, huh? ...</p>
