                &quot;Do you remember a few days ago - my first day back on the 
                island since the summer - when you and I had sex together?&quot; 
                Torrie asked Lindsay, as the duo lounged together upon the spacious 
                bed in the room they shared. Of course, I was spying on their 
                every word with the help of my voyeur room.<p>
                &quot;Are you crazy, Torrie?&quot; Lindsay countered. &quot;How 
                could I forget that?&quot; The 19-year-old seductress paused for 
                a quick moment, then shivered in remembrance. &quot;You about 
                ripped my pussy apart with that big, nasty strap-on you used.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I guess that was a stupid question,&quot; Torrie remarked. 
                &quot;But what I was getting to was what I had said to you just 
                before we got all hot and heavy with each other that day. Do you 
                remember what it was that I said?&quot;<p>
                Lindsay puckered her lips together and shook her head in response. 
                &quot;No, I don't. Can you refresh my memory?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I said the biggest reason why I came back to the island 
                was so I could be with you,&quot; Torrie told her younger lover. 
                &quot;Jeremy and Pamela are great, and I love them. But you, Lindsay. 
                YOU are the main reason why I came back to the island in the first 
                place. I love being with you.&quot;<p>
                The little blonde offered one of her patented, sweet smiles before 
                embracing Torrie with both arms for several seconds. &quot;Thank 
                you, honey,&quot; she said after the hug ended, still smiling. 
                &quot;And yes, now I remember you saying that. It is a very kind 
                thing to say, too.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Kind, and meant in every way,&quot; Torrie said. &quot;Lindsay, 
                I've lusted after you from the very moment all of us came here 
                for the first time, at the beginning of the summer. But you were 
                always more involved with Trish. I respected that, and knew that 
                you and her loved each other very much.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yeah!&quot; Lindsay returned, another smile upon her face. 
                &quot;I can't wait until Trish comes back to the island. Jeremy 
                said she will be here sometime tomorrow evening.&quot;<p>
                Torrie frowned at those words before saying, &quot;Can I tell 
                you something, dear? I don't think you'll like it, though.&quot;<p>
                Lindsay's expression tightened as she nodded her head.<p>
                &quot;Sure. You can tell me anything. What is it, Torrie?&quot;<p>
                The 26-year-old hesitated before answering, &quot;When Jeremy 
                called last month and asked if I wanted to come back to the island 
                for another ten weeks, the first thing I said to him concerned 
                you and Trish. Would Trish be coming back, too?&quot; Torrie paused 
                before continuing, &quot;Of course, Jeremy said no. So I said 
                yes - I would love to come back.&quot; She took a deep breath 
                and concluded, &quot;But if he said yes - Trish was going to be 
                here too... I would have turned the offer down.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Why?&quot; Lindsay asked, a confused look upon her face. 
                &quot;I thought you liked Trish. You and her always got along 
                real good together during the summer. I don't understand...&quot;<p>
                &quot;I do like Trish,&quot; Torrie said. &quot;I don't have a 
                problem with her. But this all goes back to you, Lindsay. I knew 
                without Trish here, I would have a chance to develop a real relationship 
                with you.&quot; The stacked blonde paused and then added, &quot;But 
                now, with Trish coming back... all chances of you and I being 
                together are suddenly gone. Trish is going to be wrapped around 
                you like a wet blanket, and vice versa.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You and I will still have our time together,&quot; Lindsay 
                promised, extending her hand and placing it upon Torrie's shoulder. 
                &quot;I won't be with Trish during every single minute of every 
                single day, you know. You and I... we had plenty of time alone 
                together during the summer. Right?&quot;<p>
                &quot;You don't understand, sweetheart,&quot; Torrie said to her. 
                &quot;It's not just about sex.&quot; She hesitated before adding, 
                &quot;I love you, Lindsay. I always have. And I'm not saying that 
                in a general sense, either. I REALLY do love you.&quot; Torrie 
                tapped her chest and concluded, &quot;With all of my heart.&quot;<p>
                The 19-year-old's eyes were wide as she took those words in. A 
                second or two later, she was able to respond, &quot;Thank you, 
                Torrie. I... I don't really know what to say. I love you too, 
                but maybe not in the same way you love me.&quot;<p>
                Torrie feigned a smile before saying, &quot;Those feelings are 
                reserved for Trish, right?&quot;<p>
                &quot;What are you saying?&quot; the little blonde asked.<p>
                &quot;Put two and two together, 'Lin,&quot; Torrie told her. &quot;The<p>
                past several days, since I came back to the island, you and I 
                have been room-mates. We've been getting along great and as far 
                as I thought, we were starting to develop a bona-fide relationship. 
                I was hoping that by the end of the winter, you would feel the 
                same way about me... as I do about you.&quot;<p>
                Torrie fought back a hurtful moan (but failed) and added, &quot;Now, 
                there is no chance of that. Trish is coming back to the island. 
                You and her are going to be together again. And I'm going to be 
                left out in the cold.&quot; She paused and concluded, &quot;Now, 
                my reason for coming back to the island is gone. I should have 
                just stayed in California.&quot;<p>
                Lindsay, perhaps feeling concerned for her room-mate, looked at 
                Torrie with a distraught expression before giving her a warm embrace. 
                &quot;I don't want you to feel that way,&quot; the teen said. 
                &quot;You coming back to the island was a great thing. I'm so 
                happy that you came back.&quot;<p>
                Torrie sighed and remarked, &quot;What does it matter, though? 
                The main reason - really the only reason - why I came back, was 
                so you and I could be together. I was always jealous of Trish 
                during the summer, though I never let anyone know that. I wanted 
                you to love me the same way you loved her.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I... I don't know what to say, Torrie,&quot; Lindsay returned 
                as their long embrace ended. &quot;Trish and I, we became really 
                close during the summer. We were the best of friends. We shared 
                so many things. She... she took my virginity. She helped me have 
                confidence in myself.&quot; Lindsay paused and said, &quot;You're 
                not thinking of going home... are you?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I don't know,&quot; Torrie responded, her tone of voice 
                revealing that she was becoming quite upset. &quot;It's just not 
                fair! Here you and I were - starting to develop something really 
                nice. But it all gets destroyed, because Trish is making her triumphant 
                return to the island.&quot;<p>
                Torrie's eyes began to stream with tears as she angrily professed, 
                &quot;My God, Lindsay! If you loved me the way you loved Trish, 
                I would have NEVER left the island like she did! I'd give up everything 
                in my life, just for you!&quot;<p>
                With those words, Lindsay simply stared at Torrie with a stunned 
                expression upon her face. Torrie was revealing an emotional side 
                of herself which none of us had ever seen before. She was really 
                upset that Trish was coming back.<p>
                &quot;I... I need some time to think,&quot; the 26-year-old said, 
                before getting up from the bed and storming out of the room.<p>
                &quot;Torrie!&quot; Lindsay exclaimed, initially making a motion 
                to follow her girlfriend, but then freezing momentarily. Next, 
                the little blonde settled back on the bed and first sighed, then 
                frowned in a very negative way. &quot;Torrie...&quot; she cried.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>Seated in the voyeur room, I was absolutely stunned at the conversation 
                which had just taken place. I knew that Torrie had a soft spot 
                for Lindsay, but had no idea her feelings were quite that emotional, 
                and so deep-rooted.<p>
                I could certainly understand Torrie's feelings, however. She wanted 
                an opportunity to win Lindsay's heart, but now felt as though 
                any chance of that was dead - and buried. Lindsay and Trish never 
                stopped loving each other, despite the several thousands of miles 
                which had been between them these past few months.<p>
                All of the attention Lindsay had been giving to Torrie, the pornstar 
                probably thought to herself, would surely be directed toward Trish 
                now. Torrie would not even have a slim chance to get Lindsay to 
                notice her in a loving way. That was likely her thought process...</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>As Lindsay hung her head low while sitting on the bed, apparently 
                lost in thought, I followed Torrie's movements through the mansion 
                with my surveillance cameras.<p>
                Still visibly upset and distraught, the 26-year-old headed for 
                the kitchen. She stopped short, however, upon finding Pamela and 
                Stephanie engaged in a jovial discussion in the room directly 
                before the kitchen. Evidently, Torrie was in no mood for any sort 
                of human contact right now.<p>
                Thus, she went outside and made her way over to the east side 
                of the mansion. I felt sorry for Torrie - I could see the tears 
                in her eyes as she woefully trudged along.<p>
                Finding a spot in the shade, Torrie crouched herself down into 
                a seated position against the cobblestone wall. She bunched her 
                knees close to her chest and wrapped her arms around them, and 
                really started to cry out in frustration. I had definitely never 
                seen this side of her before.<p>
                Now I felt extremely concerned myself for Torrie.<p>
                Acting on impulse, I immediately got up from the chair and headed 
                out of the voyeur room. I sealed its entrance and then left my 
                personal suite, and went directly to the area outside where Torrie 
                was absolutely crying her heart out. I was not about to let one 
                of my ladies - my personal goddesses - feel so upset and heartbroken.<p>
                Remembering how she had ducked away from both Pamela and Stephanie 
                moments earlier, I approached Torrie with patience and caution. 
                She probably did not feel like talking right now, but I couldn't 
                stand to see one of my ladies like this. She was still balling 
                her eyes out...<p>
                &quot;Hi there,&quot; I said in a quiet tone, holding my hand 
                in front of me and waving it back-and-forth. Through her tears, 
                Torrie looked up at me and sniffed her nose, but didn't say anything. 
                &quot;Mind if I sit down here?&quot; were my next words, pointing 
                to a spot on the ground next to her.<p>
                Wiping away her tears, Torrie shrugged her shoulders in response. 
                I wasn't sure if that was a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, 
                but I took the initiative anyway and sat down next to her.<p>
                &quot;What are you crying about?&quot; I asked, grabbing ahold 
                of Torrie's hand and squeezing it gently. I already knew the answer, 
                of course. But since I had spied on Torrie's prior conversation 
                with Lindsay, with the help of my voyeur room, she did not know 
                that. Nor did I want her to know, either.<p>
                &quot;I... it's... you wouldn't understand, Jeremy,&quot; Torrie 
                replied after several seconds, sniffing her nose once more while 
                trying to regain her composure. Perhaps changing her mind, Torrie 
                then said, &quot;It's... it's about Lindsay.&quot;<p>
                &quot;What about Lindsay?&quot; I queried, feigning ignorance.<p>
                &quot;Lindsay is okay, isn't she? She didn't hurt herself?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Oh no, nothing like that,&quot; Torrie returned, to which 
                I offered an exaggerated sigh of relief. &quot;It's just... I 
                love Lindsay, Jeremy. I really do. I... I was hoping that her 
                and I could develop something special over the next several weeks. 
                It... it was really the only reason why I decided to come back 
                to the island in the first place.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You and Lindsay have been together the past couple of days, 
                since you returned,&quot; I told her. &quot;You've been sharing 
                the same room. I don't understand... why are you upset? You and 
                her have been together a lot recently.&quot;<p>
                Torrie threw her hands up and shook her head in obvious frustration. 
                &quot;What am I upset about? TRISH! That's what I'm upset about!&quot; 
                Torrie, usually calm and friendly, began to show some anger in 
                her voice. &quot;Trish almost destroyed Lindsay when she left 
                her in the summer-time. Now, months later, Trish just decides 
                out of the blue that she wants to ride back into Lindsay's life. 
                For what? So she can stay here for awhile, then rip Lindsay's 
                heart out AGAIN?&quot;<p>
                My eyes were wide and bulging in response to the venom which Torrie 
                was spewing. I didn't even know that she was capable of such an 
                outburst. It was stunning to me.<p>
                &quot;I don't think Trish is going to leave Lindsay again,&quot; 
                I said to Torrie, though I'm certain she did not want to hear 
                that. &quot;I talked to Trish this morning on the telephone. She 
                said she made a mistake in leaving the first time. And Trish promised 
                that it will never happen again.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Just like all those other broken promises Trish made?&quot; 
                Torrie shot back, still very upset. &quot;Oh, she was going to 
                spend the rest of her life with Lindsay. She was going to DEVOTE 
                her life to Lindsay, and NOTHING would ever split them apart. 
                It was nothing but a LOAD OF GARBAGE!&quot;<p>
                I was too shocked to even respond.<p>
                &quot;Trish absolutely stuck a dagger in Lindsay's heart by<p>
                leaving her,&quot; Torrie continued, her vocal outburst nearing 
                its apex. &quot;But since Lindsay is so nice and sweet, and so 
                forgiving... she is willing to take Trish back. I love Lindsay, 
                Jeremy, and I would NEVER do a THING to hurt her!&quot; My senses 
                nearly exploded as she added, &quot;I just think Trish is nothing 
                more than an inconsiderate BITCH!&quot;<p>
                Perhaps I was not the only one shocked by Torrie's words. The 
                exotic blonde sat there silently for several seconds, looking 
                at me with a blank expression. All of a sudden, she began crying 
                again, then got up and ran off in a rage.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>A moment later, I went searching for Torrie, but could not find 
                her. I was worried about her - to say the least. Thus, the only 
                place I could turn was the voyeur room. I needed to know not only 
                of Torrie's whereabouts, but also that she was safe... and stable.<p>
                As I made my way back to my personal suite, I had too many emotions 
                and thoughts in my head to make sense of what had turned out to 
                be a major, big-time mess. I would have to sort through everything 
                within my mind before I could even begin to assess this situation.<p>
                There was one thing I knew for sure, however...<p>
                Trish was NOT a bitch.<p>
                Trish was one of the nicest, most caring people I had ever met 
                in my life. She had a heart of pure gold, and there wasn't a mean 
                bone in her entire body.<p>
                Torrie's words were obviously out of anger, and while she may 
                have truly believed some of those things she said about Trish, 
                I'm fairly certain that she did not think of her as a bitch. Trish 
                was the furthest thing from being a bitch. She was a complete 
                and total sweetheart.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>When I returned to the voyeur room, I found Lindsay seated at 
                the control panel. The 19-year-old had her face in her hands as 
                she too, was in the process of crying. I took a quick peek at 
                the spread of television monitors on the big wall, and found that 
                Torrie was hiding out near the tennis court. She looked more distraught 
                than angry now...<p>
                &quot;I heard it all,&quot; Lindsay said, looking up at me with 
                her eyes full of tears. &quot;I wanted to see where Torrie ran 
                off to after she left me, so I came here, to the voyeur room. 
                Just as I walked in, you sat down next to Torrie. I heard all 
                those nasty things she said about Trish.&quot;<p>
                &quot;And I spied on your entire conversation with her, before 
                that,&quot; was my confession.<p>
                &quot;I thought you did,&quot; Lindsay said, forcing a smile. 
                &quot;It was too much of a coincidence for you to just run into 
                her outside, on that side of the mansion.&quot; Lindsay paused 
                and continued, &quot;Torrie said she loves me, and wants to be 
                with me. But Jeremy... I love Trish. Torrie is really sweet and 
                all, but my feelings for Trish are so much stronger.&quot; Her 
                upper lip quivered as she concluded, &quot;Torrie had NO RIGHT 
                to say those things about Trish.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I know she didn't, sweetheart,&quot; I agreed, stealing 
                a glimpse of Torrie on the wall monitor before turning my attention 
                back to Lindsay. &quot;But she said those things, and I think 
                she meant most of it. Especially the part about Trish ripping 
                your heart out, and possibly doing it again.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You don't believe that... do you, Jeremy?&quot; Lindsay 
                asked in a total whine.<p>
                &quot;Of course not, honey,&quot; I told her. &quot;Trish thinks 
                the absolute world of you. She always has, and always will.&quot;<p>
                Lindsay's eyes narrowed as she began to cry harder. &quot;The 
                po-popular opinion around here is th-that Trish left me-me,&quot; 
                the blonde choked, barely able to get her words out. &quot;But 
                the truth is, and always has been... I left Trish.&quot;<p>
                &quot;What makes you say that?&quot; I asked, stepping forward 
                and bringing Lindsay into my arms. She returned my embrace, and 
                took a seat in my lap as I settled down onto an adjacent chair. 
                I held her close while keeping an eye on Torrie, who was now shaking 
                her head while trying to hold back her very own set of tears.<p>
                &quot;Trish and I were supposed to go and live in Canada,&quot; 
                Lindsay replied after several seconds of silence. &quot;That... 
                it was the plan, all along. I devoted myself to her. I promised 
                her I would go and live in Canada with her.&quot;<p>
                &quot;But all of a sudden,&quot; Lindsay continued, &quot;I went 
                back on my promise... my vow, to her. I wanted to stay with you 
                and Pamela here, on the island. I didn't want to leave this place. 
                I didn't want to leave you, Jeremy.&quot;<p>
                The little blonde coughed and went on, &quot;I... it's just... 
                Trish's family is very important to her. She always talked about 
                how much she loved them, and missed them. I heard it from her 
                all summer long. I... I never blamed her for going back to Canada, 
                leaving me. Her family was too important to give up. She couldn't 
                spend the rest of her life on this island with you, me and Pamela. 
                She needed her family.&quot;<p>
                Lindsay paused before adding, &quot;The reason her and I split 
                up is because of ME. If I kept my promise to her, we would be 
                living in Canada right now. I...&quot; Lindsay started to cry 
                again as she concluded, &quot;I'm the one who... ripped her heart 
                o-out. I did it. It was all... my-my f-fault.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You can't think that way, sweetheart,&quot; I said, securing 
                her even more with a tighter embrace. &quot;With you and Trish, 
                there was no right person, or wrong person. It wasn't your fault. 
                It was just a relationship which couldn't work at the time, strictly 
                because of geographical reasons. Trish wanted to live in Canada 
                while you preferred this island.&quot; I paused before adding, 
                &quot;But now... Trish is coming back.<p>
                You should be happy for that, sweetheart.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I am happy!&quot; Lindsay shot back, shoving herself out 
                of my embrace. &quot;But what to do about Torrie? She hates Trish 
                now, but Trish did nothing wrong. It's all my fault. I care about 
                Torrie a lot. But I don't love her the way she wants me to love 
                her.&quot;<p>
                I rubbed my eyes with the thumb and forefinger from my right hand 
                before glancing back up at the voyeur screen. Torrie was seated 
                against the net of the tennis court, her knees up and arms curled 
                around them. And she was crying.<p>
                &quot;You'll just have to tell Torrie what you said to me,&quot; 
                was my response for Lindsay's prior question. &quot;You'll have 
                to tell her that Trish did nothing wrong, and the reason you and 
                her split up was all your fault. I don't believe that myself, 
                sweetheart, but it may be the best thing to say to Torrie right 
                now... especially since you believe it.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Can you talk to her for me, Jeremy?&quot; Lindsay begged, 
                almost whining. &quot;I'd be no good at that. I'd... I'd just 
                break down and start crying. Besides Pamela, Torrie is my second 
                favorite girl - next to Trish. I want them to get along, and be 
                happy.&quot;<p>
                &quot;It's amazing,&quot; Lindsay soon added. &quot;Trish and 
                Amy wound up hating each other because of me. Now, Trish and Torrie 
                may end up the same. Who's next? Trish and Pamela?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Don't talk like that!&quot; I shot back at her in an emphatic 
                tone. &quot;Trish and Torrie are not going to hate each other. 
                And from my conversation this morning with Trish, she said she 
                has every intention to make amends with Amy.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Really?&quot; Lindsay cried, her eyes gleaming with hope.<p>
                &quot;Really,&quot; I confirmed.<p>
                &quot;Will you talk to Torrie for me?&quot; Lindsay asked again.<p>
                &quot;Please, Jeremy? PLEASE?&quot;<p>
                I really did not want to dive head-first into the middle of what 
                was going to (but hopefully won't) turn out to be a nasty love 
                triangle. But at the same time, I could not resist Lindsay, or 
                turn her down.<p>
                Especially when she cried like this.<p>
                I took a deep breath and replied, &quot;Yes, I'll talk to her, 
                and see what I can do.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Thank you, Jeremy!&quot; Lindsay exclaimed, throwing her 
                arms around my shoulders and hugging me tightly.<p>
                &quot;You're welcome, sweetheart,&quot; I said, watching Torrie 
                on the monitor as she continued to cry out her anguish.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>I was in an unenviable position. Indeed, I was going to plunge 
                myself right into the middle of this love triangle. I really didn't 
                want to talk to Torrie about this, but felt as though I had to. 
                Lindsay was too docile to do it herself.<p>
                I always tried to look at things in a positive manner, and hoped 
                that would be the end result of this. The best case scenario would 
                be Torrie taking back the nasty things she said about Trish (especially 
                the &quot;bitch&quot; reference). Trish and Lindsay would be together 
                again, without any problems or resistance from Torrie, and everyone 
                would be happy. That was what I was hoping for.<p>
                The worst case scenario? Don't even ask me about that.<p>
                I didn't even want to THINK about it...</p>
