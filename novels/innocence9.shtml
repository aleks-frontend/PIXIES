                In Which Innocence is restored to Purity; the beauty of Innocence 
                is immortalised on film and Purity and Innocence are exposed to 
                the virtues of great wealth and proportion.
              <p>Dodie and Innocence were staying at different resorts on opposite 
                sides of the mountain where they met, so despite Dodie's entreaties 
                that they stay together and further what she said was potentially 
                a beautiful relationship, Innocence returned to her hotel room 
                to spend a few more uneventful days in the shadows of Les Petits 
                Grands. She soon felt the need to return to the vegan commune 
                in the hope that Purity would have returned. The thought of being 
                with Purity once more filled Innocence with a warmth of expectation 
                and desire.<p>
                When she returned, she carefully removed her clothes before coming 
                within sight of the commune as she didn't wish to attract the 
                approbation of the more fundamentalist commune members, although 
                she was aware that the stares she got were no less pronounced 
                than before. She felt nervous as she walked towards the main farmhouse, 
                her penis shrivelled from anxiety and aware that although her 
                hair had grown to nearly a centimetre in length it was still very 
                short in the eyes of her company. She was delighted though when 
                Purity hurried up towards her smiling with her arms outstretched. 
                In less than no time Purity's arms were around Innocence's naked 
                body and they were kissing each other full and long. <p>
                &quot;I'm so pleased you came here!&quot; Purity exclaimed. She 
                ran a hand down Innocence's stomach from the hollowed recess of 
                her navel, over the flatness of her stomach and to her penis. 
                &quot;And you can see that you have nothing to fear of being naked 
                here! Isn't it so much nicer?&quot;<p>
                Innocence let her eyes drop down to her waist where the whiteness 
                of her skin around the groin clashed determinedly against the 
                opaqueness of Purity's skin. She was very conscious of the lack 
                of sun she'd allowed against her lower body and how untanned she 
                seemed in contrast to the others.<p>
                Innocence enjoyed her stay at the commune much more now that Purity 
                was there to share it with her. She and Purity slept in the same 
                room and the same bed in the commune. At first she was alarmed 
                that she would have to share the bed with two others: a fat woman 
                with an unfortunate propensity to fart and belch for which she 
                never apologised nor gave any warning, and a very skinny man with 
                a very thin penis and a wispy apology for a beard. <p>
                Innocence soon found out more about the sexual ethics of the commune 
                which she found she was expected to participate in. This was principally 
                that one would never have exclusive partners - this was considered 
                a great vice leading to jealousy and selfishness. And also one 
                had to be very open about one's sexual behaviour and pay no attention 
                to anyone else's presence when making love. This meant that at 
                any moment and at any time Innocence would stumble across two 
                or more people making love with each other making no allowance 
                for the nuisance the flailing of their limbs or their ecstatic 
                gasps would make. Another feature of the sexual ethics was that 
                there was apparently no concept of aesthetic choice in whom one 
                made love to - and most certainly gender, race and age were not 
                to be used as grounds of discrimination either.<p>
                As a result she often found Purity in the throes of lovemaking 
                with the most unattractive people, and usually at some time in 
                the night during, after or before Purity and she had made love 
                together. She might be deep inside Purity, her bottom trembling 
                with ecstasy, sweat clinging to her chest and Purity's vagina 
                clasped tightly to her penis (Purity had quite a grip which she 
                used to great erotic effect). Then Innocence would notice a hand 
                grasp her testicles, or another tongue probe the entrance to her 
                anus as her buttocks were gently parted, or see another penis 
                appear in front of her face to be greedily gobbled by Purity. 
                Sometimes there might be four or five people gathered around Purity 
                and her participating in their activity with no prior invitation 
                to do so.<p>
                Innocence knew that her attitudes towards sex were definitely 
                not as liberated as they ought to be. She found some of the partners 
                she'd make love to distinctly unattractive. They might be grossly 
                obese with layers of fat around the top of their thighs and contrasting 
                tiny hands or feet. They might be painfully thin with breasts 
                more like fat sausages with hairy nipples at the end. There were 
                penises that barely made any impression when erect - perhaps half 
                an inch long and spurted uncontrollably and often into her face. 
                There were those who made no effort to clean the shit from their 
                bum after they'd excreted leaving unpleasant dried and sometimes 
                moist brown faeces trailing between their cheeks. A common feature 
                of members of the commune was their lack of physically attractiveness 
                - Bouche and Purity were very prominent exceptions and this possibly 
                explained their popularity as partners. This common feature was 
                partly obscured by the curtains of hair over the face and shoulders, 
                but not assisted in many cases by the untrimmed facial hair.<p>
                Innocence wasn't getting to enjoy the meals or the meetings any 
                more. The meals were distinguishable only by the strength of the 
                herbs and spices that were mixed in, sometimes so strong that 
                however hungry she happened to be she was unable to digest the 
                food at all. The meetings became, if anything, more tedious as 
                she became more familiar with the topics of conversation. Frequently, 
                in any case, she would find her attention diverted from the meeting 
                as Purity or another person would start stimulating her penis 
                or even suck it off in full view of everyone.<p>
                Purity was not one of those in the commune who spent most of her 
                time working in the fields or cooking. She was one of those who 
                went outside and worked in the community. She was almost openly 
                dismissive of the majority of the commune who never ventured outside 
                its grounds. &quot;They might as well be anywhere! Why bother 
                to live in Sauterelle?&quot; she would say. Innocence was never 
                completely sure what Purity did to earn money, although Purity 
                never deliberately hid the source of it. It just seemed to differ 
                every time. Sometimes she would earn money at a shop selling incense, 
                tarot cards and joss-sticks. Sometimes at a market stall selling 
                mystical books. Sometimes at record shops or factories or cleaning 
                streets. &quot;I'm very resourceful!&quot; she admitted.<p>
                When she was at the commune, she spent most of her time with Innocence 
                but often she didn't come back leaving Innocence feeling lonely 
                and friendless. Only Bouche would give her any great attention 
                when Purity wasn't around. Somehow, Innocence's very obvious difference 
                could only be broached when she was already occupied with Purity. 
                Bouche couldn't be around all the time of course, so often Innocence 
                would help at the commune in peeling turnips, boiling carrots 
                or tilling the soil with the wooden instruments that they made 
                themselves and somehow preferred to those that could be bought 
                at shops. Often she would sit in her room watching life go by 
                through the window of her room. Sometimes she would be watching 
                people making love, but usually she just watched mundane activities 
                and the games of the animals.<p>
                Because of the commune's disapproval of clothes, she felt nervous 
                about venturing into Sauterelle where her penis attracted so much 
                attention and which she couldn't hide. When she did venture, she 
                would try her best to obscure it with her hands or a bag, but 
                it was very uncomfortable to keep up her guard in this way. Her 
                hair was growing longer though. She no longer looked like a nun 
                but her hair was too untidy to make her look at all stylish. She 
                viewed herself in shop mirrors (there were no mirrors at the commune 
                as such vanity was discouraged) and longed to be allowed to style 
                the awkward mass of inch-long hair.<p>
                &quot;What you need to do,&quot; Purity advised Innocence, &quot;is 
                to earn some more money and work in the community.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Doing what?&quot; asked Innocence. &quot;Photography?&quot;<p>
                Purity smiled. &quot;Why not?&quot; She leant over to Bouche who 
                was sharing the bed with them at that stage. &quot;Any suggestions?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I might be able to help,&quot; Bouche answered, looking 
                up from the fat short penis she'd been stroking. &quot;I'll ask 
                around.&quot;<p>
                Bouche's photographer friend didn't have any work at present. 
                He was still selling prints of the previous sets of pictures, 
                but he said the pictures had generated a fair amount of interest. 
                &quot;Women so well endowed aren't that common even in Brook!&quot; 
                he explained. However, a day or so later Bouche was able to tell 
                Innocence of work that both she and Purity could participate in.<p>
                &quot;It's a film that someone's making about life in a small 
                village or something,&quot; she explained. &quot;Or is it about 
                some court case. Anyway, they're very interested in incorporating 
                Innocence in some scenes to add some extra interest. And also 
                they want someone to help with the fuck scenes.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I don't want to fuck in front of the camera!&quot; gasped 
                a horrified Innocence.<p>
                &quot;No, not you,&quot; smiled Bouche. &quot;It's the main star. 
                She's black and she also doesn't want to be filmed fucking. So 
                they want some black girl just for those scenes.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Fucking in front of a camera never bothered me!&quot; laughed 
                Purity. &quot;Anything for money. Within reason of course.&quot;<p>
                So the two girls accompanied Bouche to the set of the film which 
                was in a small village, Escarbot, just outside Sauterelle. The 
                director was a lanky tall gentleman who wore only a waistcoat 
                and a shade over his eyes. He was very impressed by Innocence's 
                appearance and was even more attracted by her cinematic potential 
                when Bouche demonstrated that her penis was fully functioning. 
                &quot;It's a shame I'd never heard of you before,&quot; he commented, 
                &quot;otherwise I could have made a whole film around you. The 
                most I can do at present is to get a scene or two written in which 
                you're incorporated.&quot;<p>
                Innocence's appearance was indeed appropriate for the present 
                film in that as a result of living in the commune she had a very 
                rustic appearance about her. Particularly with regard to her short 
                unkempt hair and the tan she was developing from staying out in 
                the sun so much. The role in which she was cast was essentially 
                as a village eccentric. Originally, the village eccentric was 
                to be eccentric by virtue of being an invalid. &quot;But that 
                wasn't very cinematic,&quot; explained the director. &quot;We 
                wanted a character that was somehow odd. A leper. A village idiot. 
                A eunuch. We considered lots of alternatives. But you're just 
                perfect. And sexy too!&quot;<p>
                Innocence wasn't required to do a great deal of acting as such. 
                Her lines didn't amount to very much and were certainly not too 
                much for her to memorise. Mostly she was just filmed in positions 
                that could be incorporated where appropriate in the film later. 
                Great attention was given to her penis to ensure that it was easily 
                visible but not too blatantly so. Bouche's skills were employed 
                here to give it the right touch of tumescence that was required 
                for the big screen. <p>
                Innocence enjoyed having make-up put on her - a thing which Purity 
                was adamant on refusing for herself. She watched herself in the 
                mirror as her face and body were touched up to suit the demands 
                of the camera. She thought to herself that when she'd been paid 
                for the film, the first thing she'd do would be to go to a beauty 
                salon and get her hair cut properly. Here, the hair was trimmed 
                only so much that it would look appropriately untrimmed but still 
                cinematic.<p>
                Purity's role was much more basic, and consequently she was able 
                to avoid being made up. In the film, the lead character was a 
                black woman who was married to a man in this small village where 
                there was considerable racial prejudice. Part of the irony was 
                that the black woman was not accepted into the community because 
                of her differentness whereas the character played by Innocence 
                who was no less different (and in fact probably a great deal more 
                so) was. By some series of complications, all this chemistry led 
                to a court case and a tragic end to the film, but none of these 
                scenes concerned either Purity or Innocence. These weren't to 
                be filmed in the village of Escarbot and the sex scenes didn't 
                involve the black actress.<p>
                The actress didn't blanche so much at the fellatio scenes - although 
                the director pointed out that these would probably have been modified 
                had she objected. So the filming of the sex scenes would continue 
                with the male actor (or at least his member) getting quite excited 
                as she slobbered about with his balls and his prick. Bouche was 
                very dismissive of her technique. &quot;She'd never get a job 
                like mine,&quot; she sniffed. &quot;Look at the amount of wasted 
                film there'll be. It's taken her nearly ten minutes to get it 
                to that size! And I don't think she could she could get it any 
                bigger!&quot;<p>
                Then Purity would step into the fuck scene. The black actress 
                would step to one side wiping her full lips clean of the taste 
                of the male actor's penis. She would wander off to the changing 
                room where she would clean her teeth to remove every last trace 
                from her mouth. In the meantime, Purity would move into place 
                in the film set and her film lover would insert his now erect 
                penis into Purity's cunt. Purity and the actor would improvise 
                the rest of the scene which Purity would succeed in prolonging 
                to at least ten minutes and several quite different positions. 
                Purity was particularly keen on anal fuck scenes as she'd been 
                told by the director that if they were included in the final cut 
                it would increase her bonus, but she was sensitive enough not 
                to reduce the standard vaginal shots to too few a number. While 
                they were fucking, the camera operators would run around taking 
                shots of almost only the genitals from many different angles. 
                They seemed to get dangerously close to the action, but Purity 
                was sufficiently used to having sex in public not to appear in 
                the slightest bit concerned.<p>
                &quot;That was excellent, Darling!&quot; exclaimed the director 
                afterwards. He'd been watching the fucking through the monitors 
                connected to the camera that was filming and by means of which 
                he'd been co-ordinating the activity. &quot;You're a real professional! 
                We've probably got enough material in that one shoot not to need 
                to take it again! Ace! Brill!&quot;<p>
                The director then explained how the footage would be incorporated 
                into the film. The black actress would later be filmed with the 
                actor feinting sex in various positions that fitted in with the 
                penetration and ejaculation shots, and these would be intercut 
                with the scenes with Purity. &quot;No one will be any the wiser!&quot; 
                he said. &quot;Nobody will be able to tell the difference between 
                one black fanny and another!&quot; However, he commented that 
                the unshaved legs and the mass of hair on Purity's head might 
                complicate some of the shots. &quot;Darling Papillon religiously 
                shaves her legs, so we'll have to carefully edit out any glimpse 
                of yours, Darling. You've got delicious legs - absolutely super! 
                - but the hairiness just won't be right!&quot;<p>
                Purity and Innocence lived together at the film set for several 
                days and didn't venture back to the commune at all. Bouche felt 
                much more loyal to the commune and went back every evening. She 
                complained that she was underworked, but not about the pay. Although 
                there was a need for erect or slightly tumescent penises in the 
                male cast, this was not for all scenes. Most of the film had no 
                sex content at all, and indeed the cast wore more clothes on set 
                than off. The director admitted that the film could have been 
                filmed almost anywhere in the country and there was nothing very 
                special about Brook except that the liberalness of the environment 
                meant that there had developed a very healthy pornographic film 
                industry and consequently a lot of concurrent film services.<p>
                Innocence was delighted when she got paid. There was more than 
                enough for her for a long time and she'd got a film credit as 
                well! She'd definitely be looking forward to seeing herself and 
                her penis on the large screen. &quot;All I'll see of myself is 
                my cunt and arse!&quot; sniffed Purity, who, although she'd earned 
                less than half of what Innocence had earned (even with her anal 
                sex bonus!), was pleased with what she'd got. The worry Innocence 
                had related to returning to the commune.<p>
                &quot;I don't think I want to go back!&quot; she confessed.<p>
                &quot;Why not?&quot; wondered Purity who seemed genuinely concerned 
                at parting from Innocence. Their time together in Escarbot had 
                been passionate and very enjoyable.<p>
                &quot;I don't like it. I don't like the food. I don't like the 
                meetings. I don't like a lot of the people. And I don't like feeling 
                like a freak!&quot;<p>
                Purity seemed quite upset. &quot;I'd no idea it was so bad!&quot; 
                <p>
                &quot;It's you I love! Not the commune!&quot;<p>
                At that Innocence and Purity made a very tearful decision to part. 
                Purity back to the commune, and Innocence resolved to return to 
                her sister and her sister's lover. She felt that in their company 
                she would be better accepted than anywhere else. Purity admitted 
                that she wasn't sure how long she intended staying with the commune. 
                &quot;It's my life at the moment. It's not easy to leave!&quot;<p>
                Innocence kept true to her earlier resolve. She returned to wearing 
                shorts to hide her penis and went to a beauty parlour to have 
                her hair cut and styled. When she left with tastefully applied 
                rouge on her nipples and a blonde bob, she felt curiously liberated, 
                but resolved to see more of Brook before returning to Chastity 
                and Kedi.<p>
                Before she left Brook, Innocence arranged to meet Purity again 
                for a last drink at a cafe bar in Sauterelle, known as the Rampant 
                Lion, an occasion Innocence knew would be very sad. &quot;You 
                will come and visit me?&quot; she insisted of her black lover.<p>
                &quot;And you'll come back to Sauterelle?&quot; Purity responded.<p>
                The Rampant Lion was a place of glass, ivory and lush red velvet 
                upholstery only half full of mostly young people who were without 
                exception naked. Innocence, in fact, was the only one whose genitals 
                were covered, but the shorts she was wearing were so tight that 
                with the exception of the crotch her beautiful figure wasn't obscured 
                at all. She had heard somewhere that in Brook there was no visible 
                class distinction or any other kind because everyone was equally 
                as bare, but Innocence no longer believed this. Purity very much 
                stood apart and not just by virtue of her skin colour. No one 
                else paid so little attention to the state of their hair or the 
                hirsuteness of their limbs. No one else at this rather pricey 
                retreat wore anything as basic as nothing on their feet. And everyone 
                wore at least a bit of make-up - if only to highlight the nipples 
                or to accentuate the toe or finger nails or just to enliven the 
                lips of their vaginas. Innocence felt obliged to go to the counter 
                each time to buy the drinks so that Purity wouldn't be embarrassed 
                by any rudeness from the bar-staff.<p>
                Innocence was sat perched on the stool by the bar with her reflection 
                staring at her from both the mirror behind the bar and the one 
                that covered the bar counter itself waiting for the barmaid to 
                finish serving another woman who seemed to be buying for a group 
                of ten other women. They were probably office girls on their lunch 
                break, but from the hoots and gales of laughter that erupted on 
                occasion from their table Innocence wasn't sure that they weren't 
                midday party-goers. Then she heard a girl who was between her 
                and the one being served draw in her breath and give a soft whistle 
                just below her voice. This was accompanied by &quot;Would you 
                ever believe that!&quot; coming from the table of office-girls. 
                Innocence turned her head to see what was attracting the attention.<p>
                It was a large well-built man, as unshaven and hairy as any of 
                the men at the commune but with a red richness of hair that didn't 
                look at all unkempt, but indeed rather grand and majestic. Like 
                all the other patrons he was naked, except for the bag he was 
                carrying over his shoulder which he hoisted off as he made his 
                way to the bar. It was not however the attractiveness nor the 
                hairiness of the man that was attracting so much attention, however, 
                as the size of his limp penis dangling majestically between his 
                legs. It was at least ten inches long over a pair of equally majestic 
                testicles. Innocence had never seen anything like it. Her own 
                penis was nothing like as large as that.<p>
                When the gentleman arrived, he was served directly before Innocence 
                even though she'd been there first - but she didn't mind as it 
                gave her more opportunity to examine his magnificent endowment. 
                The girl who was standing next to Innocence started chatting idly 
                with him. Innocence herself had finally got served and picked 
                up the two cocktails she'd ordered.<p>
                &quot;Haven't I seen your photograph?&quot; suddenly remarked 
                the gentleman to Innocence.<p>
                She started. Did he mean the photographs taken by Bouche's photographer 
                friend? That was always possible. &quot;I don't know,&quot; Innocence 
                answered slightly blushing. &quot;Where might you have seen it?&quot;<p>
                &quot;At a friend's home,&quot; commented the gentleman in his 
                deep voice. He frowned while trying to remember where it might 
                have been.<p>
                &quot;Was it in a magazine?&quot;<p>
                &quot;No, not a magazine. Although it wouldn't surprise me at 
                all to discover that a beautiful woman such as you were a model. 
                No, it was a photograph in a frame. Are you a friend of a woman 
                called Une, by any chance?&quot;<p>
                Innocence started. &quot;Well yes I am.&quot; She knew the photograph 
                he meant and she also knew that it showed her totally naked with 
                her penis on full display with Une in her white gown gently stroking 
                it. So this gentleman knew her great secret!<p>
                &quot;You must be Innocence. I've been told so much about you. 
                My name's Leon. May I join you?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I'm with a friend,&quot; explained Innocence in a way that 
                was more an invitation than a statement. She and Leon walked up 
                to the settee where Purity was sitting and looking terribly bored. 
                She was flicking through the pages of a woman's magazine that 
                was supplied by the cafe-bar containing recipes, knitting designs 
                and pictures of men with fully erect and slightly shiny penises. 
                It was with such a page being open that Purity raised her head 
                to virtual eye-level to Leon's penis and was instantly taken aback.<p>
                &quot;My god!&quot; she gasped accepting the cocktail from Innocence's 
                hand. &quot;Is it real?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Is what real?&quot; laughed the gentleman still standing 
                while Innocence sat down next to Purity.<p>
                &quot;Your prick. Is it real?&quot;<p>
                Leon laughed and looked around the bar where other patrons averted 
                their eyes guiltily. &quot;Feel it and see!&quot;<p>
                This Purity did without any shyness. &quot;It's amazing. And exactly 
                the right proportions. The weight of these balls.&quot; She weighed 
                them in her palm and pinched one. It was almost the size of a 
                snooker ball. &quot;Does it work?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I'm not going to show you now whether it works or not,&quot; 
                teased Leon, pulling a chair towards him and sitting down on it. 
                <p>
                The conversation soon roamed away from Leon and his assets, and 
                although he gently hinted at his knowledge of Innocence's unique 
                attributes it stayed generally away from genitals altogether. 
                Leon lived in Brook, partly, he said, because of the weather and 
                the people, and partly because of the difficulty of finding a 
                pair of trousers or underpants that were appropriate elsewhere. 
                &quot;I'd probably have to wear a kilt or toga otherwise!&quot; 
                he joked. He'd not always lived in Brook, but it was here that 
                he had started his business and although it had branches throughout 
                the country it remained based there and so did he.<p>
                When the evening ended, Leon invited the two girls back to his 
                hotel room in Sauterelle which they were glad to do. It was a 
                full suite in the Hotel Abeille with a beautiful view over the 
                town of Sauterelle to the mountains and sea beyond. Innocence 
                had never seen so much luxury before and was completely overawed, 
                but not Purity who was in next to no time on top of Leon's penis 
                sucking away at it. Innocence was alarmed as his penis stirred 
                and grew and grew and grew yet more. The length of it was at least 
                as long as Purity's arm from elbow to wrist.<p>
                &quot;Have a taste!&quot; invited Purity. Shyly Innocence, still 
                in her shorts, crawled over the silk sheets of Leon's bed and 
                with a little temerity applied her lips to the underside of Leon's 
                prick which noticeably stirred. The two girls licked and sucked 
                around the enormous mass of penis. Innocence put as much of it 
                in her mouth as she could and that was barely the glans.<p>
                &quot;Take off your shorts,&quot; suggested Leon. &quot;I know 
                what you have to offer!&quot;<p>
                Innocence smiled shyly but undid the belt of her shorts and pulled 
                down both shorts and the knickers underneath revealing her own 
                very stiff and excited penis which nonetheless looked very small 
                indeed compared to that of Leon. He bade Innocence to turn her 
                body round and put her penis into his mouth while she and Purity 
                continued to massage his. At one stage, Purity attempted to get 
                some of it into her cunt but no more than seven or eight inches 
                of it could get in her and it was clear to Innocence that although 
                she was terribly excited and well juiced it was causing her a 
                certain amount of pain. Tenderly Innocence eased Leon's penis 
                out of her cunt and licked the lips with her tongue.<p>
                When Leon came, it lasted several minutes as spurt followed spurt. 
                There was so much semen stored and waiting to come out that it 
                couldn't be relieved in just one go. Semen spread everywhere. 
                Purity had a mouthful and Innocence too and still their bodies 
                were covered in the sticky lubricating stuff, the sheets clearly 
                stained. This stain was not alone because in amongst the spurts 
                of Leon's semen Innocence's own also spurted free into Leon's 
                mouth and trickled down Purity's face. Never in their lives had 
                the two girls seen so much semen.<p>
                And then Leon's penis shrivelled gradually back to its original 
                ten inches. But everyone was too exhausted to repeat the exercise. 
                Innocence's mouth and jaw ached from the strain of putting such 
                a large firm thing inside it. Purity's groin throbbed and ached 
                and there was blood where some of her inside flesh had torn in 
                the exercise. (&quot;My second maidenhead!&quot; she joked looking 
                at the blood smeared on her hand.) Leon was the least exhausted 
                of the three of them, but he made no attempt to re-initiate the 
                lovemaking. Instead he tenderly kissed the two girls, told them 
                that they could stay the rest of the night and that the bathroom 
                facilities were theirs whenever they wanted to use them.<p>
