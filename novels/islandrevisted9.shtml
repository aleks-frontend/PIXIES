                Before Amy's live Internet show took place a few days ago, I sent 
                an e-mail to Trish - Lindsay's old flame and an island alum - 
                giving her my personal username and password to the website so 
                she could have access to it. My sincere hope was that Trish would 
                sign-on and see those live images of Lindsay, and then come running 
                back to her (and the island).<p>
                I have said it a million times, and I'll say it a million more 
                if need be - Lindsay and Trish belong together. There was no doubt 
                about that in my mind. Trish told me moments before leaving the 
                island this past summer that she loved Lindsay, and always would. 
                Even though one mention of Trish usually made Lindsay frown, I 
                knew the teen still loved her, too. Both of them belonged together. 
                It was that simple.<p>
                Their reason for being apart was strictly geographical. Trish 
                wanted to be with her friends and family in Canada, while Lindsay 
                preferred staying here on the island.<p>
                The original plan was once the summer ended, Lindsay was going 
                to move to Canada with Trish, so the two ladies could spend the 
                rest of their lives together. That soon changed, however, once 
                Lindsay decided that she rather stay on the island with Pamela 
                and yours truly than move to Canada. Once that happened, Trish 
                opted to stay on the island, too.<p>
                Lindsay enjoyed the sun and the surf too much to leave.<p>
                But a short time later, Trish decided that her life in Canada 
                was much too important to totally abandon. She could not commit 
                herself to spending the remainder of her life on the island - 
                even if it meant leaving Lindsay behind.<p>
                From the very moment Trish left the island, I held out hope that 
                she would one day return. But since a lot of time had passed since 
                I sent her that e-mail, with my username and password for Amy's 
                website, I was about to give up.<p>
                If there was one thing that would convince Trish to come back, 
                it would have been that webshow. In seeing Lindsay, perhaps those 
                feelings of love and devotion would have returned to Trish. That 
                was my sincere hope, at least.<p>
                But since I hadn't received a reply from her - knowing that she 
                checked her e-mail several times a day - I simply figured Trish 
                deleted my message upon receiving it. Logic only says that if 
                Trish did visit Amy's website and watch the show, and have her 
                feelings re-kindled in the process, she would have at least replied 
                and told me so by now.<p>
                Alas... I had received nothing from her.<p>
                Perhaps my faith all along was blind... and Trish had turned the 
                chapter, in regards to Lindsay, in her life. I wanted to think 
                differently, but now it was pretty clear. I needed to turn the 
                chapter myself, and give up hope. Living in Canada with her friends 
                and family closeby was obviously more important to Trish than 
                absolute, true love.<p>
                On the other hand, spending her days and nights on an island paradise 
                was more important to Lindsay, too. It really went both ways, 
                though I always preferred to look at it from the perspective that 
                Trish was the main culprit. After all, Trish was the one who left 
                Lindsay behind - not the other way around.<p>
                No matter the case, I just wanted Lindsay and Trish to be together 
                again. I now realized that was never going to happen. Trish would 
                have definitely replied to me by now...</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>On a better note, the day following Lindsay's birthday party 
                (as well as the monumental gang-bang), the ladies and I had an 
                in-depth discussion in regards to the upcoming Christmas holiday. 
                December 25th was not that far off.<p>
                Before all of them arrived on the island, I promised the group 
                of women that I would send them home for a week - if they so desired 
                - so they could spend the holiday with their loved ones. That 
                was a major selling point, considering how this was the winter-time, 
                in getting them to commit ten weeks of their lives to the island.<p>
                As we shared another scrumptious dinner meal, courtesy of Louisa, 
                I went over all the details and answered any questions the girls 
                had concerning Christmas.<p>
                I would escort them back to the mainland, via boat, on Saturday 
                the 22nd. The girls would then fly to Los Angeles, and board a 
                connector flight to wherever home was for them. A week later, 
                on the 29th, they would return to the island and we would get 
                back to (our unique version of) normal.<p>
                Even though I would have (selfishly) preferred that all of the 
                women stayed here with me for the holiday, I could not hold them 
                back from their families during this time of year. It would not 
                have been right of me to do.<p>
                All of the ladies were leaving for that week, with the sole exception 
                of Pamela. The original plan was for Lindsay to stay on the island 
                with my wife and I, for a very special Christmas, but the teen-ager 
                decided that she rather visit her family in Ohio. Lindsay, Pamela 
                and myself had been a devoted three-way couple since the summer 
                ended, but I had no problem with her change of heart. Lindsay 
                did love her family, and hadn't seen them in almost six months.<p>
                So, Pamela and I would spend a romantic week together - all alone. 
                We would be together for every waking hour... the more I thought 
                of that, the more I liked it. Pamela was my wife, and I loved 
                her more than anything in the world. It would be wonderful to 
                have a whole week to ourselves.<p>
                The only woman who would leave the island that week, but actually 
                not visit her family, was Amy.<p>
                Despite claiming on her website that she would not make another 
                movie until February or March, the porn star had also changed 
                her mind. She got into contact with her agent through e-mail, 
                and he managed to land her a leading role for a film which would 
                be shot during Christmas week.<p>
                The movie would be released in mid-January, and I very much looked 
                forward to adding it to my collection. I was the owner of ALL 
                of Amy's porn movies (as well as Torrie's). Both of them were 
                really the only two starlets that I cared to see on the smut screen 
                anymore.<p>
                Many of the girls were curious as to whether or not there would 
                be a Christmas celebration here on the island, with the entire 
                group involved. I told them that Pamela and I were planning a 
                big dinner for the evening before all of them took their one-week 
                leave of absence. There would also be a Christmas grab-bag, I 
                informed them, with plenty of presents and stocking-stuffers to 
                keep everyone happy.<p>
                I went onto say that before they left the island, I would give 
                each lady $2,000 in cash so they could buy their family members 
                and loved ones some nice presents. I figured for women such as 
                Devon and Cassidy, neither of whom had much of a bank account, 
                the money would come in real handy.<p>
                Even if they didn't spend any or all of that $2,000 on gifts, 
                I told the ladies the money was theirs. It was just one of my 
                presents to them - and they certainly appreciated my generosity. 
                Of course, I appreciated the happiness and joy each of them had 
                brought me with their mere presence.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>After dinner, everyone felt stuffed to the max. Louisa, our 75-year-old 
                housekeeper, really was the best cook in the whole, wide world. 
                All of the ladies told her this, and thanked her for such a wonderful 
                meal as I dutifully cleared the table of empty glasses and dinner 
                plates.<p>
                Of course, I basically took care of the initial clean-up every 
                night after we ate. Louisa was an old woman with a bad back, and 
                I figured I was doing her a tremendous favor by clearing the table 
                each evening. She did plenty as it was - with cooking, laundry 
                and light household cleaning.<p>
                I guess some in my position - as the leader of a harem - would 
                not like such a role, but I really did not mind. I could assign 
                the girls to do the clean-up each night, on a rotating basis, 
                but figured since no one (but me) enjoyed cleaning, I didn't want 
                to overburden any of them with it.<p>
                There have been those rare occasions when I have asked for a volunteer 
                to help me, but mostly, I just did this myself. The ladies were 
                guests of mine (as well as Pamela and Lindsay), and should not 
                be expected to do chores.<p>
                In the process of cleaning up, Stephanie approached me and asked 
                about the Christmas grab-bag, and if it would be okay if she bought 
                presents for all of her fellow ladies during her week home, in 
                Connecticut.<p>
                I smiled in response, knowing it was a kind thought on her part, 
                before telling her that she could - if she wanted. There would 
                be plenty of gifts in the grab-bag so it would not be necessary, 
                although if she wanted, I would not stop her. I told Stephanie 
                that she was a thoughtful person.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>It was 10:00pm that evening when I found myself in a very familiar 
                place - the voyeur room.<p>
                Instead of whacking off with my eyes fixated on a heated sexual 
                encounter - as I usually did while here - I was watching (and 
                listening to) Devon and Cassidy as the two ladies sat together 
                on the big bed in their personal room.<p>
                Cassidy was beautiful, but of course, I found myself much more 
                interested in the vivacious and alluring Devon. Just a mere glimpse 
                of her was enough to give me a raging hard-on.<p>
                &quot;I heard Jeremy is worth a billion dollars,&quot; Cassidy 
                commented in a soft tone, looking at her room-mate. &quot;No wonder 
                he can afford a place like this - the island - while also being 
                able to provide us with lots of money and gifts.&quot; She paused 
                and added, &quot;I bet he thinks he'll never be able to spend 
                all of that money himself, so he helps others.&quot;<p>
                Devon smiled and said, &quot;I agree with you. Jeremy is a real 
                sweetheart. He's not your typical billionaire. Not many people 
                would basically give their money away like he is. We're getting 
                $3 million each for staying here for less than three months, and 
                we don't deserve it.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yeah, I know,&quot; Cassidy commented. &quot;An island paradise, 
                with sun and swimming, in maybe the most beautiful and picturesque 
                area of the world - the South Pacific. We're all bi-sexual, and 
                we're among a group of beautiful women who are just like us. We 
                spend our days having fun and sex with each other.&quot; She giggled 
                before adding, &quot;If anything, we should be paying Jeremy to 
                stay here!&quot;<p>
                Devon smirked and countered, &quot;I don't think that we're all 
                worth $3 million, though. I could stay here for fifteen or twenty 
                thousand, for three months, and be happy. I have no idea what 
                I'll do with $3 million once returning home.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Maybe you could become a loan shark!&quot; Cassidy shot 
                back, sneering. &quot;I also heard that Jeremy promised all of 
                the girls who were here in the summer a cool $50,000 each, while 
                one would get half a million. Winds up that he gave all of them 
                $1.5 million each. That's called extreme generosity.&quot;<p>
                &quot;As I said,&quot; Devon returned, &quot;Jeremy is not your 
                typical billionaire. I can't see him being some shrewd businessman 
                who stepped all over others on his way to the top. It's not his 
                style to do that. That is why I'm curious as to how he got all 
                of his money. But, he refuses to tell, and Lindsay and Pamela 
                are apparently sworn to secrecy.&quot;<p>
                &quot;He probably invented some type of computer hardware, or 
                a top-selling video game,&quot; Cassidy speculated. &quot;I mean, 
                just look at the way he was talking the other night when explaining 
                his computer's capabilities to Amy. He sure didn't sound like 
                a casual computer user to me. It seemed as if he knew what he 
                was talking about, and had first-hand knowledge of the stuff... 
                like a computer genius.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I could really care less about his money, myself,&quot; 
                Devon said. &quot;I just think Jeremy is an incredibly nice, and 
                good person. Pamela sure is lucky to have found him, and married 
                him.&quot; My eyes went wide as Devon added, &quot;I wish I found 
                him first. I'd love to have a husband as sweet as him.&quot; She 
                paused before continuing, &quot;But please don't tell anyone I 
                said that, Cassidy. I don't want to hurt their marriage.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Your words are safe with me,&quot; the gothic princess said, 
                criss-crossing her heart with a fingertip for emphasis.<p>
                My mind began to work overtime in regards to what Devon had said 
                about me. She wishes that she found me before my wife, Pamela, 
                did? Devon would like to have a husband just like me? All of it 
                was very flattering, indeed, but those words made me feel a bit 
                guilty because my personal thoughts concerning Devon were not 
                quite that wholesome.<p>
                Since I first seen her at the airport, several days ago, I had 
                thought of Devon as a total object. She was a lust bunny, to say 
                the least, and my only thoughts about her involved sex and perversion. 
                This was because I found her body to be absolutely flawless, and 
                built for hardcore sex. Devon was every fantasy I ever had - come 
                to life.<p>
                While I had these ideas about her, Devon was wishing that her 
                and I were married. That was not right on my part. Devon was a 
                person, with emotions and feelings like the rest of us. I shouldn't 
                be thinking of her like a piece of meat.<p>
                Amy was a definite lust bunny herself, but I had always been able 
                to look at her as a person first - then as an object. Why was 
                it with Devon, my thoughts were different? Of the two, Amy should 
                be considered more of an object. She was the insatiable, seasoned 
                porn star - not Devon.<p>
                Devon was just a dental assistant from Pennsylvania who, until 
                coming to the island, had never branched far from her home-state. 
                Why did I think of her in a different light?<p>
                But Devon was also in the wrong too, concerning her thoughts about 
                me. I was married to Pamela, and nothing - not even this incredible 
                goddess - would ever change that.<p>
                Fortunately, the 24-year-old quickly added after sharing her inner 
                thoughts with Cassidy that she had no desire to harm my marriage 
                with Pamela. Otherwise, I would probably feel very concerned right 
                now. It was okay for her to perhaps think that way about me. But, 
                I did not want Devon to start scheming against Pamela, and our 
                marriage.<p>
                &quot;My last boyfriend was such an awful jerk,&quot; Devon said, 
                contiunuing her discussion with Cassidy. &quot;But for whatever 
                reason, I loved him at first. I really did.&quot;<p>
                Cassidy suppressed a laugh and said, &quot;It always seems to 
                be that way with guys who are jerks.&quot; She shrugged her shoulders 
                and added, &quot;I've been down that road before.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I went over to his house one day,&quot; Devon explained. 
                &quot;I got off early from work, so we could spend the afternoon 
                and evening together. I even bought him a present.&quot; Her lips 
                twitched with remorse before she continued, &quot;When I got there, 
                I let myself in and found him doing my two best friends at the 
                same time.&quot; Devon shook her head and added, &quot;Well... 
                they weren't my best friends anymore.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I bet he asked you to join in... didn't he?&quot; Cassidy 
                speculated. &quot;All guys are that way.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yes, he did,&quot; Devon replied. &quot;This was before 
                I was bi, though I had those feelings and desires. But I was not 
                about to jump into bed with that scuz-ball, and those two skanks. 
                They had been fucking him behind my back for over a year before 
                I found out about it. Then, they expected me to hop right in with 
                them, and make it a three-on-one.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I'm sorry, honey,&quot; Cassidy said, reaching out and gently 
                placing a hand upon Devon's shoulder.<p>
                &quot;It's okay,&quot; the blonde assured her, sniffing her nose. 
                &quot;Keith just turned me off of guys for awhile. After him, 
                I explored my bi side. I found myself a girlfriend, and we had 
                a pretty good relationship for awhile, though it ended badly too. 
                I... It's all about Jeremy, though. Guys who are as sweet and 
                sincere as he is... they're hard to find.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I pretty much gave up searching for that kind of guy a few 
                years back,&quot; Cassidy said. &quot;If one falls into my lap, 
                that would be great, and I would consider marrying him. But I'm 
                not searching for one anymore. Most of my relationships now don't 
                last that long, and are based strictly on sex.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I found the perfect guy for me,&quot; Devon said, her eyes 
                wide and looming as she took a deep breath. &quot;Unfortunately, 
                he is married to someone else - Pamela.&quot;<p>
                With those words, I gulped my throat. It sounded as if Devon was 
                actually serious with her thoughts concerning me. Was that reason 
                enough for me to be worried about it? She had only known me for 
                a couple of days...<p>
                &quot;Jeremy isn't different than most guys when it comes to sex, 
                though,&quot; Cassidy said. &quot;Look at what he has done. He 
                brings all of us here, he has sex with us. He brings a whole group 
                of men to the island, so they can gang-bang us.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Are you complaining about that?&quot; Devon giggled, to 
                which Cassidy shook her head negatively. &quot;Jeremy may be a 
                pervert in some ways, but we're all perverts here. We wouldn't 
                be on the island if we weren't all perverts.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You have a point there,&quot; Cassidy smirked.<p>
                &quot;It is one thing to have a perverted side, yet be a very<p>
                nice and good person at the same time,&quot; Devon said to her 
                room-mate. &quot;To me, that is Jeremy. I don't like perverts 
                who are also jerks in all other phases of life, too.&quot;<p>
                &quot;It's good to have a spicy sex life,&quot; Cassidy remarked. 
                &quot;I couldn't survive without one. Just the mere thought of 
                spreading my legs, underneath the covers in the missionary position, 
                for the same man for 40 years... I cringe. I need lots of partners; 
                lots of variety, to keep going.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I know what you mean,&quot; Devon said, tracing a hand across 
                one of her own large breasts as she wore an oversized, white night-shirt. 
                &quot;Just being here on the island, I realize I need lots of 
                partners, too. I would fuck around, but always come home to my 
                husband at the end of the day.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Your husband,&quot; Cassidy grinned. &quot;Why don't you 
                talk to Jeremy about your feelings for him?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Oh no,&quot; Devon returned emphatically, shaking her head.<p>
                &quot;I couldn't do that. I don't want to hurt his marriage. Plus, 
                I don't hold anything bad against Pamela. I think she is really 
                nice, too.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Maybe you could aspire to be their play-thing,&quot; Cassidy 
                suggested, still grinning. &quot;You know, kind of how Lindsay 
                is for them. At least, she seems like their play-thing.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Hmmmmm,&quot; Devon moaned, smiling. &quot;Oh yes. I'd love 
                to be a play-thing for Pamela and Jeremy, especially Jeremy. I 
                always have had a submissive side, though it's really not been 
                explored yet. Amy was telling me that Jeremy has somewhat of an 
                interest in bondage... light bondage.&quot;<p>
                OH GOD.<p>
                I took my shaft out and immediately began to stroke it, in response 
                to the things Devon was saying about me. The luscious blonde wanted 
                to be my play-thing? She had a submissive side, and seemed interested 
                in light bondage?<p>
                As if I hadn't lusted after her enough already, now my fantasies 
                and deepest thoughts about Devon had increased ten-fold. Nevermind 
                the fact that she secretly wished that she was my wife. Devon 
                wanted to be my personal slut!</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>I missed the next few words which were exchanged between the 
                two ladies because I was looking down at my cock as I busily frigged 
                it with my right hand. However, my attention soon returned to 
                the monitor in front of me as I heard a long, drawn-out moan of 
                pleasure come direct from Devon.<p>
                I growled with my own desire as I watched Devon and Cassidy share 
                a very tender, intimate kiss with each other. Cassidy tilted her 
                head to the side, perhaps giving her better access to explore 
                the inner depths and recesses of Devon's velvety mouth. Devon 
                responded with another moan as she unbuttoned Cassidy's pajama 
                top, before slipping both hands inside and massaging the Californian's 
                breasts.<p>
                I continued stroking my cock while watching the two women now 
                trade their lips and tongues over an open-mouthed kiss. Devon 
                giggled momentarily, before sliding Cassidy's pajama top from 
                her body and then pinning the gothic princess to the bed beneath 
                her. Now straddling Cassidy's waist, Devon broke the kiss and 
                sat up, again giggling.<p>
                The jaw-dropping blonde smiled down at her room-mate while groping 
                both of her bare breasts with her hands. &quot;Do you like that, 
                honey?&quot; Devon asked, now twirling her fingertips over and 
                across Cassidy's hard, rigid nipples.<p>
                &quot;I like everything you do, baby,&quot; Cassidy grinned in 
                response, before sitting up herself and attaching her lips to 
                Devon's for another blissful kiss.<p>
                This time, the kiss these two women shared was much more intense 
                and passionate than their last one. As Cassidy reclined back onto 
                the bed, Devon went down with her in an embrace. Both ladies attacked 
                each others' mouth with their tongues in an all-out assault full 
                of erotic jabs and swipes. The breathing between them had quickly 
                become quite ragged.<p>
                Nestled atop her lover, Devon broke the kiss and then began to 
                nuzzle and suck away upon various portions of Cassidy's tender 
                neck. The 23-year-old seemed to enjoy that particular treatment, 
                as she arched her head and back in response. It only provided 
                Devon with greater initiative as she continued to kiss and nibble 
                upon Cassidy's neck.<p>
                &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; the raven-haired goddess cooed. &quot;Oh 
                yeah, baby... I like that a lot. A whole lot.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I like YOU a lot,&quot; Devon giggled, before moving her 
                lips up to Cassidy's for yet another tongue-filled kiss. Cassidy 
                grabbed the back of Devon's head and held it tightly, not allowing 
                her to break the heated kiss for several seconds.<p>
                When the grip was released, Devon broke free and moved downward. 
                She grinned for a moment, then attached her lips to one of Cassidy's 
                nipples and began sucking away upon it. Soon, the gorgeous blonde 
                was going from breast to breast, worshipping them and their nipples 
                with her mouth. Devon also paid equal attention to the valley 
                between Cassidy's breasts, licking and slurping her cleavage thoroughly.<p>
                Cassidy moaned with pure arousal as Devon then slipped a hand 
                underneath the waistband of her shorts. I could tell that all 
                of Devon's fingers were extended as she rubbed and massaged Cassidy's 
                pussy underneath the silky shorts, bringing the 23-year-old from 
                California even more pleasure as she continued to pay erotic, 
                oral homage to her breasts.<p>
                &quot;Hmmmmm... yeah,&quot; Cassidy moaned, clamping her thighs 
                together upon Devon's probing hand. &quot;Do you know how good 
                that feels, baby? Oh yeah... real good. Really good.&quot;<p>
                A moment later, Devon managed to slide Cassidy's shorts and G-string 
                down her hips and thighs, and eventually off. Now, Cassidy was 
                completely nude.<p>
                Smiling, Devon retracted her mouth from Cassidy's breasts and 
                looked eye-to-eye with her. &quot;I'm glad you like it. But you 
                know what? I can make you feel even better.&quot; Devon pressed 
                her lips to Cassidy's for a quick kiss, then offered her another 
                charming smile. &quot;With my tongue, of course.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I like the sound of that,&quot; Cassidy smirked, spreading 
                her thighs in both preparation and anticipation. At the same time, 
                Devon got rid of her oversized night-shirt. Much to the delight 
                of Cassidy (as well as myself), the 24-year-old from Pennsylvania 
                was not wearing a bra or panties. Thus, her spectacular, nude 
                body was now on total display.<p>
                I continued to frig my pulsing erection as Devon slid further 
                downward, her blonde head coming to a stop between Cassidy's outstretched 
                legs. When the gothic beauty moaned and tensed up in heated desire, 
                I did the same.<p>
                &quot;Sweet, little pussy,&quot; Devon softly cooed, her hot tongue 
                busy licking and swiping away at the tender, moist folds of Cassidy's 
                womanly slit.<p>
                I watched with wide eyes as Devon, perched upon her hands and 
                knees, wiggled her hips in a very seductive manner as she went 
                to work on her room-mate. With the camera angle from behind, I 
                had an excellent view of Devon's upturned ass, as well as her 
                pussy, as both swayed from side to side. It was, as you may imagine, 
                a truly amazing sight.<p>
                What I wouldn't give to be there right now, on my knees behind 
                her... so I could stuff that pussy full with my cock.<p>
                &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Cassidy moaned, several times in succession, 
                as Devon continued to orally worship her with her tongue. The 
                Californian was busy squirming and writhing about upon the bed, 
                while squeezing and mauling her own breasts for extra stimulation. 
                I was about to lose control of myself...<p>
                Devon withdrew her face from the joining of Cassidy's thighs long 
                enough to give her a smile, before she jammed two fingers into 
                her lover's pussy and began thrusting away. In no time flat, Cassidy's 
                eyes were bulging as she arched her back high off the bed in response.<p>
                Keeping her face at a distance, Devon just used her fingers as 
                she hammered them in-and-out Cassidy's slit at a rather furious 
                pace.<p>
                The raven-haired minx was moaning rather loudly and intensely 
                as she looked up at Devon, who smiled back at her. Those two fingers 
                still shoved deep in her room-mate's swollen pussy, Devon moved 
                upward for a quick moment so she could offer Cassidy another kiss 
                on the lips.<p>
                An instant later, however, Devon's face was once again buried 
                between Cassidy's outstretched thighs.<p>
                I growled out like a madman as my cock simply erupted, cum spewing 
                out upon my wrist and all over the front of my trousers. I continued 
                stroking, however, and found myself getting hard rather quickly 
                while keeping an eye on the luscious sight of Devon's tight, perfect 
                ass as it continued to sway from side to side upon the monitor.<p>
                When Cassidy finally screamed out and clenched her thighs tightly 
                around Devon's head, I knew she was in the process of an orgasm. 
                Lowering herself to her stomach upon the bed, Devon arched her 
                knees and linked her feet together, then held them high as she 
                really dug into Cassidy's pussy with her probing lips and mouth. 
                Seconds later, she added a pair of fingers to the mix, and had 
                Cassidy screaming out her lust until the orgasm finally subsided 
                and faded away.<p>
                When Devon withdrew her face from the depths of Cassidy, I noticed 
                that it was completely saturated with pussy-cream. Devon offered 
                Cassidy a smile, before extending her fingers to her room-mate's 
                mouth. Cassidy immediately took each inside, and began to suck 
                on them as if they were a cock.<p>
                &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Devon moaned, smiling. &quot;Lick ALL of 
                your hot pussy-juice off of my fingers. Lick them dry!&quot;<p>
                Cassidy moaned and smiled as she complied with the nasty request. 
                At the same time, Devon used her free hand to wipe her own face 
                dry, before taking her fingers into her mouth and cleansing them 
                thoroughly. &quot;Hmmmmm...&quot; she purred, her eyes fixated 
                upon Cassidy. &quot;Tastes delicious.&quot;<p>
                Once Devon withdrew her other fingers from Cassidy's mouth, the 
                stacked blonde lunged forward and offered her lover another heated, 
                tongue-filled kiss. The two ladies smiled at one another just 
                before sharing a warm embrace. Next, they exchanged another smile 
                as both curled up under the bedsheet and gazed adoringly into 
                each others' eyes.<p>
                &quot;You should try to warm Pamela up with that tongue of yours,&quot; 
                Cassidy grinned. &quot;You know, if you want to be her and Jeremy's 
                play-thing. Work on Pamela, too.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Oh, don't worry,&quot; Devon told her. &quot;I plan to.&quot; 
                She paused before adding, &quot;All I know is that I want Jeremy. 
                I'll go through Pamela to get him, if I have to.&quot;</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>My eyes wide and looming, I got up from the chair in my voyeur 
                room and retreated back to my personal suite. Pamela was in the 
                recreation room, along with Torrie and Lindsay, listening to some 
                music CDs. So, I had the suite to myself for the time being.<p>
                Devon sure did seem aggressive with her words about me, but I 
                wondered if they were just that - words. Would Devon really go 
                out and try to act upon what she had said?<p>
                Without the help of the voyeur room, I would never know that she 
                felt this way about me. Was I making too much of this? Was it 
                normal for women to talk this way to their friends about married 
                men whom they felt attracted to?<p>
                Just because Devon said those things, or thought this way... it 
                didn't mean she had any real ideas or plans to follow through 
                with it. At least, I didn't think so.<p>
                I could not see Devon saying those things if she knew I had been 
                eavesdropping the whole time. I wanted Devon in the worst way 
                possible, but knew that I would have to tone down my feelings/lust 
                for her if she had even the slightest intention of harming my 
                marriage with my wife.<p>
                Devon would go through Pamela, she said, if she had to... in order 
                to get to me? That sounded overly aggressive. But at the same 
                time, moments earlier, Devon told Cassidy that she would never 
                hurt my marriage with Pamela.<p>
                And what exactly did that mean? She would warm Pamela up to the 
                idea of her being our personal &quot;play-thing&quot;? Or did 
                Devon have ideas or thoughts of stealing me away from Pamela? 
                Perhaps all of it was nothing more than idle chatter between Devon 
                and Cassidy. Perhaps I shouldn't have eavesdropped...<p>
                Was I confused?<p>
                You bet...</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>Fortunately, something came up which would prevent me from over-analyzing 
                and dissecting Devon's comments for the remainder of the evening. 
                That something turned out to be a very big thing.<p>
                I found that new e-mail was awaiting me on my computer.<p>
                Here is an unedited copy of the message:</p>
              <p> FROM: Patricia (last name) ((e-mail address))<p>
                SUBJECT: i want to come back</p>
              <p>hi jeremy,</p>
              <p>ive never been much of a typer or writer so<p>
                ill get right to the point. i didn't see it<p>
                before but see it now. me leaving your<p>
                island way back in august was the single<p>
                biggest mistake of my life. i have been<p>
                fooling myself ever since in thinking that<p>
                my life is better now because of it.</p>
              <p>i guess i finally realized this when i went to amy's website 
                the other night and seen lindsay in action. i didnt like seeing 
                her in a porn movie but it made me remember how much i love her 
                and need her in my life. she is such a total sweetheart and i 
                have no idea why i left her in the first place.<p>
                you said in your email to me that i am welcome back to the island. 
                well i want to come back now. i have thought about it the past 
                couple days and am dead set serious about it. i need lindsay in 
                my life. i will sell my health club and leave all of my family 
                behind just so i can be with her.<p>
                please call me Jeremy and let me know when i<p>
                can come back to the island. if it can be<p>
                right now or tomorrow when i come that would<p>
                be great. please also tell lindsay that i<p>
                love her and am coming home. and this time i<p>
                will be home to stay. -love, trish</p>
              <p>No longer concentrating on Devon and her words about me, I reclined 
                back in my chair at the computer desk and smiled. A personal fantasy 
                of mine had just come true...<p>
                Lindsay and Trish were going to be together again!</p>
