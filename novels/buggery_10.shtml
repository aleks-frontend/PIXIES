              <p>As it spurted out of her fanny onto the short curling hairs of 
                her vagina, Tracey reflected on the inconvenience of having hair 
                so short that it marked her out from the other girls. It wasn't 
                that short now, and her mousey-brown natural colour was beginning 
                to overcome the bleach which made her hair look so unnaturally 
                pale. She hoped it would grow long soon, and fast. She'd rather 
                do without a bonus than attract the attention of every man who 
                had a thing for short hair. Back home, that wouldn't have bothered 
                her. In fact, anything which got her a good fuck or two on a night 
                out was welcome. But here, the fucking was even more mechanical 
                and careless, so that those fucks in the alleyways seemed almost 
                tender and loving by comparison.<p>
                When Jack took her back to the production line, she was pleased 
                to see Buttercup in her place, struggling with the wings of a 
                chicken and stabbing it viciously with her knife: perhaps taking 
                out on the dead fowl the anger that she felt towards her most 
                recent fucker. Tracey was almost glad that she'd had to endure 
                a fucking as well as her. Somehow, it slightly evened up the girls' 
                relative misery.<p>
                The rewards of the day's work was even greater for Buttercup than 
                before and both Zeta and Tracey had to help Buttercup carry her 
                rewards home. Buttercup, however, seemed to even hate her bonus 
                and had almost refused to take it when it was handed to her, but 
                Tracey ensured she took away as much as she was given.<p>
                The next few days continued in much the same fashion. A day at 
                work alternating with a day of exchanging at the market-place 
                whatever collection of chicken pieces, beer, canned food or chocolate 
                bars Tracey and especially Buttercup had earned from a day of 
                tedious factory work and non-consensual sex. The day at work was 
                too long and too arduous for either girl to do anything else but 
                get to and from work, and endure whatever it had to offer. Principally 
                these sufferings were cold hands, the odd nip from the knives 
                they sometimes had to use, and the pain of anal and vaginal intercourse, 
                peppered with the foul taste of an unprepossessing set of penises 
                and their sour-tasting semen. And, as Buttercup confessed, on 
                one occasion from the manager pissing straight into her mouth 
                while she was being fucked up the arse by a senior supervisor.<p>
                The days off were the days the girls enjoyed. They never seemed 
                long enough and there was so much to do in organising their home 
                and preparing food. But they got to know the other women in the 
                settlement better. Theta and Zeta became especially close friends, 
                but more because they saw in the two girls the fact that they 
                were also a committed couple like themselves.<p>
                Buttercup tired of the chicken factory. She was no good at any 
                of the tasks she had to perform, although it was her frequent 
                sexual favours for which she was rewarded and earned some quite 
                bitchy envy from other girls on the production line, who commented 
                quite openly that if she'd not been so pretty she'd have been 
                kicked out for her incompetence from the very first day.<p>
                Zeta took the girls to other factories, none of which were as 
                near as the chicken factory and none of them at all pleasant to 
                work in. There was a cigarette factory where the girls were given 
                free cigarettes during the breaks. Tracey smoked Buttercup's who 
                had no taste for them at all, and indeed avoided kissing Tracey 
                for hours after she'd had a puff.. They worked in a canned fruit 
                factory where they had to fill the unsealed cans with an exact 
                weight of slimy orange and grapefruit slices. They worked in an 
                arms factory where it didn't escape Buttercup at all of the irony 
                of a Buggery woman assembling munitions which would be used on 
                her own compatriots.<p>
                However, wherever they worked, Buttercup was not the ideal factory 
                worker, although she steadily became inured to the tedium and 
                became better at the repetitive tasks demanded of them. Tracey 
                had never thought that her life at home had ever prepared her 
                for a life abroad, but those years of dead-end tedious jobs were 
                paying off here. Only her nakedness and that of all the women 
                around her differed from the factories back home.<p>
                And of course the fucking.<p>
                You didn't expect a fuck on a day at work back home. And when 
                it happened, in the boiler room, in the broom cupboard, at the 
                back of the vans, well, it was a kind of perk. A good fuck at 
                home was to be enjoyed and even relished. Here, it was too routine, 
                too regular, and absent of even the most brusque and insincere 
                foreplay or flirting. It was up the stairs, round the back, on 
                the ground, in the cunt and climaxed on the face, breasts and, 
                even, occasionally, right inside her cunt or arse. The men were 
                all the same. Charmless, rough, rude and inexpert. None of them 
                had even the first idea about how to get more from a woman than 
                what a woman's cunt could offer them.<p>
                Buttercup became steadily less upset after each fuck, but she 
                wasn't enjoying it any the more. Because she knew it was coming, 
                she took it with more resignation but scarcely more satisfaction. 
                Sometimes after a day in the factory, she was merely bitter or 
                indignant. Sometimes, she would weep uncontrollably, a phenomenon 
                which somehow actually encouraged abuse from the men. It seemed 
                that to them, a woman was like the prey of a cat or a dog. The 
                more she showed her distress, the more they wanted to increase 
                it: piling on the indignities. But at least, she always got more 
                from it as a result, and it earned the two girls the alternate 
                days off which they treasured so much and earned them so much 
                bitching envy from their less obviously sexually attractive colleagues.<p>
                &quot;Oh, Tracey! I can't stand this any more&quot; moaned Buttercup 
                in tears on the way home one drizzly night from the dairy where 
                they'd been wrapping cubes of butter in plastic foil all day. 
                She collapsed onto the damp grass, letting her heavy plastic bag 
                of milk, butter and cheese spill out around her.<p>
                Tracey and Zeta knelt down beside her as she lay huddled in a 
                ball of depression, her arms around her legs, her knees pulled 
                up to her forehead, her head buried below her mass of tangled 
                hair, staring down through the dark shadows of her thighs at her 
                sore crotch. Both girls put their arms around her, Tracey too 
                concerned about her lover to feel too much jealousy about Zeta's 
                unwelcome show of affection towards her.<p>
                &quot;Buttercup! Buttercup! What's wrong?&quot; weeped Tracey.<p>
                Her lover raised her head and stared blankly at Tracey and Zeta 
                through a face made ugly through tears and blank depression. &quot;I 
                wasn't meant to work in a factory. I hate it so much. I was meant 
                to be a poet, an artist, a writer. Anything. Not a factory worker. 
                And I hate the fucking. And I detest the fucking men who fuck 
                me! They're such beasts! Worse even than the men in Buggery. At 
                least they enjoyed what they were doing!&quot;<p>
                Tracey wept with Buttercup, acutely distressed by her lover's 
                own distress. She looked at Zeta imploringly. &quot;This working 
                in factories isn't doing Buttercup any good at all. It's fucking 
                killing her. Isn't there anything else we can do? Isn't there 
                any other way we can live?&quot;<p>
                Zeta looked thoughtful. &quot;I don't think either are you are 
                going to be any good as farmers. And you've not been here long 
                enough to be entrusted any of the other jobs in the community. 
                I don't think anyone would vote for you. And anyway there aren't 
                any vacant positions for teachers or house-builders or whatever.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Isn't there anything else?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well, you do get a lot of sex at work. The men like you. 
                And they especially like Buttercup. And I don't blame them!&quot; 
                She kissed Tracey's lover tenderly on the cheek, but noticing 
                the jealous daggers flashing from Tracey's eyes she chose not 
                to reveal any more of her lust . &quot;Sex is something you two 
                are always going to get while you work with men. Just like Theta. 
                She had to put up with it every day just like you. But she could 
                find ways to make herself useful in the community. So, given that 
                you're going to have sex whether you like it or not in the factories, 
                why not sell it rather than give it away?&quot;<p>
                &quot;You mean fucking prostitution, don't you?&quot; snapped 
                Tracey. &quot;I'm not a fucking tart. I've got my fucking principles. 
                And my darling Buttercup's not a fucking pro neither.&quot;<p>
                Buttercup looked up solemnly. &quot;Zeta's right. It's an option. 
                I'd not heard of 'prostitution' before I came here, but it sort 
                of makes sense. I have sex with men I don't like every day anyway. 
                Is it better being a prostitute?&quot;<p>
                &quot;It might be for you,&quot; smiled Zeta. &quot;Not all of 
                us get the same attention as you do. For most girls in the factories, 
                we might have a fuck every now and then, once or twice a month, 
                not two or three times a day every day. Or even more like three 
                or four times. Most of us girls don't mind it as much as you. 
                It's not so often that it gets to be as much as an ordeal as it 
                is for you. And for those girls who don't like other girls, and 
                not all girls do, it's all the sex they ever know. But for you, 
                you're going to have it anyway. We all do a bit of prostitution 
                now and then. It's normal here in Gomorrah; though it's clearly 
                not so common back where you come from.&quot;<p>
                &quot;It doesn't exist in Buggery,&quot; corrected Buttercup. 
                &quot;Except at the tourist resorts, and it's not done like it's 
                done here. They don't stand around waiting for men to pick them 
                up and then getting given food and things for doing it. But is 
                the sex like what it is in the factories?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I don't know what it's like back where you came from, but 
                here the sex is better. Since the men have chosen you and you've 
                got the choice to tell them to fuck off, they tend to be better 
                lovers. And anyway, a lot of the men who pick you up don't normally 
                meet girls in their ordinary life. They only see girls when they 
                meet you under the lamp-posts or on the streets, so they usually 
                treat you better than the men in the factories who see women every 
                day. Some of the men aren't too bad really. And some of them are 
                a lot more generous than they are in a factory. The more they 
                like you, the more they give. And sometimes they even treat you 
                better.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You make it seem almost a good thing,&quot; mused Tracey.<p>
                &quot;It's a living,&quot; shrugged Zeta. &quot;But then you've 
                got to sometimes see it from the men's point of view. They don't 
                have relationships like you and Buttercup, or Theta and I. They 
                might have homosexual ones, but I hear they're all really promiscuous 
                and quite rough in Gomorrah. Not tender ones like you have with 
                women. In fact, some punters get really close with the prostitutes 
                and have almost regular relationships. It's the nearest they can 
                get to what we have already. You can feel quite sorry for a lot 
                of the men. Having sex with a prostitute's the only sex they can 
                have.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Do you mean they can't get married or live with a woman 
                or anything?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I don't know what 'married' means. I guess it must be some 
                kind of perversion or something, but whatever it is, no woman 
                is allowed in the men only areas, and men are just not expected 
                to live outside them. In fact, they just wouldn't be welcome. 
                So, for those with professional jobs like solicitors, doctors, 
                computer programmers or civil servants, they just don't see women 
                unless they look for them. It's only men who run places where 
                women work, and those like the police who patrol outside the men 
                only areas: they're the only ones who can meet women normally.&quot;<p>
                &quot;So, not all men are bad.&quot; Wondered Buttercup sorrowfully.<p>
                &quot;Not all! But most are pretty crap. And none of them make 
                love as well as my darling Theta. But, if you're going to have 
                sex with them anyway, and you don't want to work on the conveyor 
                belts, well, prostitution's the answer. It's not exactly a job 
                with prospects, and it's not a secure job with a pension, but 
                it's a living. And for a woman in Gomorrah, it's not the worst 
                job there is.&quot;<p>
                Tracey wasn't sure she wanted to find out what the worst job there 
                was, but she could see the wisdom in Zeta's comments. She looked 
                at Buttercup, who was looking at her imploringly. She smiled sadly 
                and nodded, recognising that her lover was now seeing the situation 
                as she did in rather stark, rather material and in rather new 
                terms.<p>
                &quot;Tomorrow then,&quot; whispered Buttercup firmly.<p>
                &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; agreed Tracey, wondering what prostitution 
                meant in a country where women were not allowed to wear make-up, 
                high heels or short skirts.<p>
                XVIII
              <p>The despair that clouded Sharon's perceptions gradually lifted, 
                and she even came to view her shaven-headed companions as her 
                friends, although she was frustrated by not being able to communicate 
                with them: her sexual tastes precluding her even from doing so 
                in the sexual way that Sweetness did with them every night. The 
                countryside they wandered through changed from barren fields, 
                to forestry, and then to some high hills covered with grass and 
                the odd wood. And then they were at the border of Buggery.<p>
                Sharon hadn't thought ahead at all. What thoughts she'd had were 
                focused either on the here and now, or on her past. Her original 
                anxieties about Sodomite pilgrims resurfaced for the first time 
                in many days. Would she and Sweetness have their tongues removed? 
                What barbarous customs did the Sodomites practice in their own 
                land? She wasn't at all comforted by the sight of the Sodomite 
                border guards with their automatic firearms, their dress of chains 
                pierced to their genitals and nipples, and of course the total 
                lack of hair.<p>
                However, she was comforted when one of the guards, a tall thin 
                man with dangling earrings and a large ring through his navel, 
                addressed her. &quot;Glad to see a convert to the Sodomite cause,&quot; 
                he said cheerfully. So, not all Sodomites had their tongues removed.<p>
                The pilgrims were clearly excited to be home, and signed enthusiastically 
                to each other, while they led Sharon and Sweetness to a small 
                railway station and onto an electric train that was waiting there. 
                They sat in a carriage together, Sharon by the window, holding 
                Sweetness by the shoulder and clasped their hands together. No 
                railway tickets were purchased, and no one else got on the train 
                while they were at the border. And finally, the train departed 
                and glid through the Sodom countryside. Sharon was perhaps expecting 
                to see a countryside as impoverished and barren as Buggery, and 
                was pleasantly surprised as they passed fields in which there 
                were tractors and farms much like those at home. The stations 
                they stopped at were serving small towns also much like those 
                at home, and the people who embarked at the stops were no more 
                dumb than herself. They may have been shaved and the only items 
                of dress they wore might have been chains and rings, but they 
                were otherwise like ordinary people, talking to each other, looking 
                out of the window or reading newspapers and magazines. Perhaps 
                it was only the pilgrims who'd had their tongues cut out.<p>
                Soon enough, the Sodomite pilgrims stopped at a larger station 
                than any other they'd passed, in the centre of a small city, full 
                of the tall buildings, apartment blocks and busy highways that 
                Sharon associated with cities at home. In a sense, all this was 
                very surreal. It almost didn't feel like a foreign country at 
                all. She took pleasure in describing all the familiar things she 
                saw to Sweetness. &quot;Ooh! There's a lamp-post. And a funny 
                church-like building. And there's a double-decker bus. And over 
                there, I can just about see an advertising board for toothpaste. 
                It's fucking magic!&quot;<p>
                It took some while for Sharon to realise that to Sweetness these 
                things were totally unknown and unsuspected. She nodded as Sharon 
                spoke, her mind perhaps on other things, and then she asked, &quot;What 
                is a 'car'? And what are 'office blocks'? And what do you do in 
                'shops'?&quot; Sharon blushed a little, and looked up at her pilgrim 
                companions who were smiling kindly and sadly at Sweetness. The 
                girl who'd first met them, signed some comments to Sharon, but 
                of course she had no idea what was being said, although she nodded 
                her head as if she did.<p>
                Then the pilgrims parted at the railway station concourse, kissing 
                and hugging each other as they signed goodbye, and Sharon and 
                Sweetness were left with just the girl they'd first met, in a 
                vast concourse, surrounded by shaven heads and the occasional 
                station announcement to places Sharon had never heard of before. 
                She was just about able to ascertain that the city's name was 
                Holiness, but beyond that she was totally lost. The girl smiled 
                and gestured to the two girls to follow her, which they did by 
                a taxi where again no money parted hands. Despite being an old 
                man and quite fat, the taxi-driver was still shaven and wearing 
                only chains and rings like everyone else. He signed to the girl 
                who had befriended Sharon, and chatted idly to his passengers.<p>
                &quot;Your first time in Sodom?&quot; he asked cheerfully. &quot;We 
                don't get many foreigners here. Any idea why that is?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I've just never seen a holiday advertised for Sodom,&quot; 
                admitted Sharon. &quot;Anyway, what's there here to see here?&quot;<p>
                &quot;It's a beautiful country,&quot; he smiled. &quot;As it has 
                to be to be the home of the Sodomite faith.&quot; He raised his 
                left hand in a gesture whose meaning was totally lost on Sharon, 
                but she noticed that he too had most of his third finger removed.<p>
                Finally, the taxi stopped outside a tall apartment block, and 
                the three girls entered the building and ascended by lift to one 
                of the higher floors. Sharon and Sweetness were escorted by the 
                pilgrim to one of many apartments where she rang the doorbell. 
                It was answered by a slim girl with dark brown eyes, full perky 
                breasts, and the usual shaven head and full accoutrement of jewellery. 
                Two large earrings dangled from her ears and she had a broad grin 
                on her face as she saw the three girls.<p>
                &quot;Oh, Grace!&quot; she cried with enthusiasm. &quot;I've not 
                seen you for so long! How was the pilgrimage? And who are your 
                friends?&quot;<p>
                Grace hugged her friend, kissing her full on the face, and then 
                signed furiously to her friend, mouthing as she did so and occasionally 
                pointing at either Sharon or Sweetness. The girl whose apartment 
                it was smiled at the two girls as they stood shyly in the corridor.<p>
                &quot;Well, come in both of you! My name's Faith, although that 
                name's a bit inappropriate unlike my darling Grace's. And Sweetness! 
                What a lovely name! It's a Buggery name but it could almost pass 
                in Sodom. But what's your name? Grace wasn't able to sign it very 
                well.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Sharon.&quot;<p>
                &quot;'Sharon'? What a weird name! But then you come from a very 
                distant country. Does it mean anything?&quot;<p>
                &quot;No! Names don't mean fuckall. They're just names.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Really?&quot; commented Faith amusedly, as if this were 
                a notion that had never occurred to her. &quot;Well, come in. 
                Come in. Sit down.&quot;<p>
                Faith's flat was relatively simple, but to Sharon's eyes was more 
                luxury than she'd seen since Throb. In the living room, there 
                were a set of chairs and a table, but no television and no pictures 
                on the wall. Faith sat arm-in-arm with Grace and the two exchanged 
                signs and kisses for a few minutes. Then Grace stood up and got 
                up to leave. She kissed Sharon on both cheeks, and then knelt 
                down between Sweetness' legs to kiss her on her crotch. And then 
                she was gone.<p>
                Faith smiled at Sharon and Sweetness when they were alone. &quot;Grace 
                has told me about how little you know of Sodomite ways and customs. 
                You're both foreigners, and apparently very ignorant of even the 
                Sodomite religion. She's a lovely girl and we've been very close 
                friends since we were at school together. But she's passionately 
                religious. Always has been. And now she's been on a pilgrimage, 
                she will always be known as Pilgrim Grace.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Why's she had her tongue cut out?&quot; wondered Sharon. 
                &quot;Did she commit some crime or other?&quot;<p>
                Faith laughed. And then continued laughing. She shook her head 
                as she tried to straighten her face. &quot;The idea of it! No, 
                never! It's a privilege to go on a pilgrimage. A pilgrim has to 
                be very committed to the Sodomite faith, and the cost of leaving 
                the country is, of course, to leave your tongue behind.&quot;<p>
                Sharon winced. &quot;That's fucking horrible! You mean you have 
                to have your tongue cut out if you want to go abroad.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well, of course! It's traditional. It was a religious thing 
                originally, but as there's so little distinction between Sodomy 
                the country and Sodomy the religion, it's required of everyone, 
                religious or not.&quot;<p>
                &quot;But you're religious, aren't you?&quot; Sharon wondered.<p>
                &quot;Well, as a matter of fact, I'm not. I'm an agnostic, which 
                means I can't get any of the top jobs in this country, but I probably 
                wouldn't have been able to anyway. Why, what makes you think I'm 
                religious?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Being friends with Grace?&quot;<p>
                &quot;That's no big deal. I'm sure Grace would want me to go to 
                the temples and pray. Or follow the five daily observances. Or 
                fast on religious holidays. But I'm not. And Grace respects me 
                too much to expect me to follow the state religion. After all 
                this is a free country. And I take it you're not religious, either. 
                So why do you think I should be?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well, you dress the same. All the chains. And the shaven 
                head. And not wearing clothes.&quot;<p>
                &quot;'Clothes'? What are they? Well, I don't know how people 
                look where you come from. Grace has told me about some strange 
                outfits in Buggery, but then it is an ignorant country of savages. 
                They have a 'king' and a 'royalty'. And all sorts of funny shit. 
                Here, it's a proper democracy where we can vote for our spiritual 
                and political leaders. And of course in a country as religious 
                as this, they're essentially the same people. No, if you want 
                to know if anyone's been baptised into the Sodomite faith, and 
                that's not done till they're old enough to know for sure, you 
                look at the third finger on the left hand.&quot; Faith held her 
                hand up for Sharon to see. &quot;Mine's intact. That means I've 
                chosen not to be baptised. Most people choose baptism and of course 
                the ceremonious finger-removal, but it's their choice. I'd rather 
                keep my finger, unless I was convinced it was worth it. I'm not 
                unsympathetic to the Sodomite religion. I sort of half-believe. 
                But I'm not really religious.&quot;<p>
                &quot;It's different back home,&quot; commented Sharon.<p>
                &quot;Really? What's it like?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well, different. There are churches and vicars and crosses 
                and things. I don't know much about it all, but it's not like 
                the weird shit you've got here.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I suppose so. It all seems normal to me, but then you're 
                a foreigner. I've heard bits about your country. It sounds quite 
                horrible. And very cold and wet. I don't know much about foreign 
                religions much. I listened to the radio once about your religions. 
                They all have strange takes on it. Many of them don't even recognise 
                the sanctity of anal intercourse. Or even understand the virtue 
                of total bodily and sexual submission. Or even recognise the value 
                of sacrifice of parts of the body to the greater good. And many 
                of them do not even practice beatings or understand the meaning 
                of humiliation. What religion do you have in your country?&quot;<p>
                &quot;It's Christian where I come from?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Crustyism? I heard about that. That's a bit like the Sodomite 
                faith. I hear you nail yourself to crosses and have some weird 
                cannibal rite where you drink blood and eat human flesh in a temple. 
                Sounds pretty perverted to me. And I heard about Muscle-men. That's 
                a religion where women and men aren't allowed to see each other 
                or have sex with each other unless they're 'married', whatever 
                that is, and have to get in different buses. And I hear they have 
                four women to each man. And they beat each other with old ropes. 
                And the men don't even shave their faces. And Bodyism. That's 
                another weird one. You just sit and meditate under trees. And 
                if your life has been truly boring and uneventful you're allowed 
                another go at it. I heard about all your weird religions on the 
                radio. Some involve worshipping elephants and big black penises. 
                Others involve banging your head against walls and wailing a lot. 
                At least the Sodomite religion's relatively sane and sensible.&quot;<p>
                Sharon didn't know enough about religion to argue with Faith, 
                and she was pleased when Faith got up and asked them what they 
                might want to drink. She didn't have any beer and, in fact, had 
                no idea what it might be. When Sharon explained what it was and 
                what it did, she frowned. &quot;I heard about that. It's a Crusty 
                thing, isn't it? Drinking alcohol and getting drugged out. We 
                don't allow intoxicants in Sodom. But I do have some tea. Is that 
                alright?&quot;<p>
                Sharon nodded. She could see that she had a lot more to learn 
                about Sodom and Sodomite ways. As Faith walked off to her small 
                kitchenette, Sharon reflected on how much was strange and how 
                much was familiar her in Sodom. It was certainly strange to be 
                with a woman like Faith who was naked except for the chains and 
                rings attached to her flesh. From behind, there was no evidence 
                of anything on her body: a long sinuous line of bare flesh from 
                her ankle to the shaven crown of her head. From the front, there 
                dangled the collection of rings and chains which all Sodomites 
                sported; although Faith's were more decorative than Grace's, including 
                a dangling gold chain from her clitoris at the end of which was 
                a dark inlaid pearl. Her nipples, like Sharon's own, had to take 
                the weight of a whole mass of chains and rings. Sharon still found 
                the appearance quite alien, and it was difficult to believe that 
                she looked much the same herself, as did little Sweetness who 
                sat quietly on an armchair and was seemingly gaining considerable 
                pleasure just from feeling its fabric.<p>
                &quot;I never knew chairs could be so comfortable,&quot; Sweetness 
                commented.<p>
                Sharon sighed. Poor Sweetness had led such a deprived life. And 
                indeed what was familiar to Sharon about Faith's flat were such 
                things as tables, chairs and the normal comforts of home that 
                Sweetness had never known. Even so it was relatively austere. 
                No stereo, no computer, no posters. Only a few books and a battered 
                looking radio.<p>
                Faith returned with a tray on which was a pot and three empty 
                cups. She lay the tray down on a small table in front of Sharon, 
                and smiled at her broadly.<p>
                &quot;Your Sweetness is a beautiful slave,&quot; she commented.<p>
                &quot;Yes, she is,&quot; Sharon replied, not convinced she'd heard 
                Faith right.<p>
                &quot;I don't have a slave at the moment,&quot; sighed Faith, 
                sitting on the sofa next to Sharon. &quot;My last slave ran off 
                with my best friend. We still don't talk about it. He was such 
                a lovely slave. A good and willing fuck. A good thick prick. He 
                used to sleep at the end of my bed. I loved showing him off to 
                my friends. And then he took a fancy to my friend, Sanctity, and 
                just left me. And now he's with her and I don't have anyone. You're 
                lucky. Your slave is so very pretty. Aren't you, Sweetness dearest?&quot;<p>
                Sharon's ward had no objection to being spoken about in such an 
                objective manner, and nodded her head eagerly in agreement. Sharon 
                herself wasn't too sure what she should say. Perhaps the word 
                'slave' had a different meaning here, she mused na&iuml;vely. 
                <p>
                &quot;Have you known Sharon a long time, Sweetness?&quot; asked 
                Faith kindly.<p>
                &quot;Not very long. Only since Joy was killed by the Gomorrans. 
                Sharon saved my life. I love her. I love her more than anything. 
                If it wasn't for her I'd be dead.&quot;<p>
                Sharon blushed, while Faith stood up and stroked Sweetness tenderly 
                on her shaven head. &quot;You're such a beautiful girl. And blind, 
                too. Did you blind yourself because of your own Buggery religion?&quot;<p>
                &quot;No, I've always been like this.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Oh! So blessed! So naturally gifted!&quot; swooned Faith. 
                She took Sweetness' bare face and pressed it against her side. 
                &quot;Such a beautiful slave. Have you thought of giving her a 
                nose-ring, Sharon?&quot;<p>
                &quot;No. Why? Should I?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I don't know how things are done in your country, but here 
                we like slaves to look like slaves. A nose-ring is the traditional 
                way. And it's so practical. You can lead your slave along on all 
                fours and it's so much easier to secure her when you want to. 
                My slave had a lovely nose-ring. It had a carved snake on it. 
                And it was so big that he could bite on it while it was still 
                in his nose. It sometimes bled everywhere. Oh! he was so sweet 
                and loving!&quot;<p>
                Sharon was still very confused, but she didn't want to confess 
                how little she understood what Faith was talking about. Clearly 
                they did things differently in Sodom. If she wanted herself and 
                her ward to survive she was going to have to learn quickly. And 
                if it meant that Sweetness was going to be her 'slave', then maybe 
                that's what she'd have to accept.<p>
                The three girls drank the tea which was weak and milkless, with 
                not even a single spoonful of sugar, let alone the three which 
                Sharon was used to at home. They chatted idly about life in Sodom, 
                Faith's job as a computer programmer and about Sharon's pilgrimage 
                through Buggery with Grace and the other pilgrims. Faith leaned 
                closer and closer towards Sharon, placing a hand on her knee and 
                an arm around her waist. Sharon quite enjoyed the intimacy. It 
                was comforting to her in this alien republic, but she didn't want 
                to reciprocate in case Faith interpreted it as anything sexual.<p>
                However, Faith didn't need too much prompting. She placed her 
                empty cup onto the table and leaned over Sharon, placing a hand 
                on her crotch, another on a chained nipple and her lips on Sharon's 
                mouth. The low moan that accompanied this sequence of actions 
                could not be misunderstood. <p>
                Sharon rather forcefully pushed her off. &quot;Don't fucking do 
                that! I'm not a fucking dyke!&quot;<p>
                Faith looked genuinely alarmed, flustered and affronted. &quot;I'm 
                sorry,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I just didn't know&#133; I just 
                thought &#133; I don't know what a 'dyke' is, but does it mean 
                you don't want to&#133;&quot;<p>
                Sharon tried to spell out her position firmly and unambiguously. 
                &quot;I don't go after women. It's cock I like. I'm not someone 
                who&#133;&quot;<p>
                Faith looked puzzled and uneasy. &quot;I don't know what you want. 
                They have different customs in your country. And anyway, I suppose 
                you just don't like me in that way. It's been so long. I just 
                hoped.&quot;<p>
                Sharon felt sorry for Faith. She looked at Sweetness who was staring 
                sightlessly in front of her, and also frowning. Perhaps it was 
                better that Sweetness had some comfort in this way. &quot;I'm 
                sure Sweetness wouldn't mind if you made love to her,&quot; Sharon 
                remarked conciliatorily. &quot;She likes women. Don't you, Sweetness?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Can I?&quot; grinned Faith broadly, regarding Sweetness 
                who was nodding enthusiastically in agreement. She kissed Sharon 
                eagerly on the lips. &quot;You're so wonderful and generous, Sharon. 
                Your own slave! For me! The ways in your country can't be so bad 
                after all if you can be so generous.&quot;<p>
                Faith left Sharon and descended on Sweetness who accepted Faith's 
                caresses with passion and delight. For Sharon, this wasn't the 
                first time she'd watched Sweetness making love with other people: 
                it had become quite a daily occurrence for her while travelling 
                with the pilgrims through Buggery. And, anyway, why should she 
                mind. She was no fucking dyke. What Sweetness got up to with women 
                was nothing for her to get worried about. And at least Faith had 
                a tongue which she could use unlike the Sodomite pilgrims who'd 
                even had their vaginas sewn together. Faith's vagina was as open 
                as her legs, her tongue was as probing as her fingers, and her 
                passion was at least as great as Sweetness'.<p>
                Sharon sat in the sofa as the two girls writhed and hugged and 
                cuddled and grappled on Faith's thin carpet. Sweetness' tongue 
                nibbling at Faith's clitoris and the jewellery dangling from it. 
                Faith's teeth, lips and tongue biting and squeezing the fleshy 
                folds of Sweetness' vulva, her two middle fingers thrusting backwards 
                and forwards in the recesses of the girl's anus. The girls' flesh 
                glinted from the sweat on their chests and arms, the chains jangling 
                and clashing against each other and against bare flesh. Sharon 
                eased a finger onto her clitoris while the lovemaking continued, 
                taking advantage of the girls' preoccupation with each other to 
                stimulate her own sex, which had only now recovered from the battering 
                it had taken in the Buggery soldiers' camp. She was surprised 
                to feel how moist she was. Was she turning into a dyke? she wondered. 
                Or perhaps she was just happy that Sweetness was happy?<p>
                She watched her ward as she grappled with Faith, the two girls 
                punctuating their passion with grunts and moans, and then she 
                heard her own name repeated low and over and over again. It was 
                Sweetness. She was actually calling out Sharon's name in her passion. 
                This instantly confused Sharon. She wasn't Sweetness' lover. But 
                part of her was pleased to be the object of such passion. Her 
                fingers dug deeper into her cunt, she bent her head back and masturbated 
                herself to an orgasm of the sort she'd never given herself since 
                she was young and very much more innocent.<p>
                XIX</p>
              <p>Tracey knew that back home she was regarded as something of a 
                slut. This had never been something which had really troubled 
                her. After all what were the opinions of a few dried-up cunts 
                compared to the pleasures of all that cock which was just out 
                there for anyone willing to grab it. She'd even sometimes been 
                called a tart, but that was an epithet too far. For all the indiscriminate 
                fucking she'd enjoyed with Sharon, she had never been a prostitute. 
                Not that she'd slighted any gifts her lovers might have left her, 
                but that was only fair. A fair day's pay for a fair day's work. 
                But it was a totally different thing to be out there, actively 
                selling her snatch.<p>
                Prostitution in Gomorrah wasn't quite the same as back home. For 
                a start, there was a lot more of it here. And also, there was 
                none of the approbation associated with it as back home. It was 
                just another way of making a living. Not that there were that 
                many options. You could work in the fields or in the community, 
                but that had very low returns, dependent almost entirely on either 
                the season or how well everyone else was doing. You could work 
                in the factories, but that invariably meant sex anyway. Especially 
                for Buttercup. She couldn't help being so very pretty, and it 
                was almost a curse to her here. And it wasn't as if the work in 
                the factories was that easy either. And Tracey hadn't forgotten 
                the time she and Buttercup woke too late to get to the front of 
                the queue of the other women waiting to get into work, and ended 
                up having to walk back home without having got anything for their 
                pains of actually getting there. As a prostitute you were guaranteed 
                of getting something, and the returns were substantially better 
                than sealing pies in cellophane, slicing legs of ham or packing 
                munitions. In fact, after her first day, Tracey was wondering 
                why she'd not opted for it earlier. She took home much more than 
                she did from a day in the factory: two packets of cigarettes, 
                a chocolate gateau, several kilos of apple and a small alarm clock. 
                <p>
                She quickly learnt how to match the value of the sexual favours 
                she gave for the rewards that came with it. A hand job was the 
                least profitable. That might get no more than a medium-sized melon, 
                or a frozen pasty, or a second-hand comb. A blow job might be 
                worth a packet of twenty cigarettes, a large bottle of Coca-Cola, 
                a whole frozen chicken or a litre of milk. A fuck might rake in 
                as much as a bottle of wine or a leg of lamb. And anal intercourse 
                would bring in a small transistor radio or a bottle of spirits. 
                Compared to how she'd been before, Tracey felt rich. And the cigarettes 
                were welcome as well, although they were very rarely any kind 
                she'd ever heard of before. But when you spent hours waiting for 
                sex by the roadside, a cigarette or two was a very welcome companion.<p>
