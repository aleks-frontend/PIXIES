                The sound of torrential rainfall bulleting itself upon the big 
                picture window in my personal suite was what finally woke me up 
                on this dreary December morning. The wind howled and gusted outside 
                as well, providing me with the stark reminder that despite living 
                in paradise, this island was not immune from the occasional severe 
                rain and electrical storm.<p>
                I was awake in bed but did not move for several seconds, waiting 
                to see if there were any thunder claps or lightning bolts which 
                accompanied the rain. Fortunately, there wasn't. Past experiences 
                of mine with Lindsay told me that the docile 19-year-old was horribly 
                afraid of any type of lightning. I did not enjoy seeing Lindsay 
                scared or upset, despite the fact that I usually wound up with 
                the honor of comforting and consoling her (with soothing hugs 
                and tender kisses). I much rather do those things in a happier 
                environment...<p>
                Those thoughts concerning Lindsay reminded me of the prior evening, 
                when Trish made her long-overdue return to the island. Lindsay 
                and Trish had finally been reunited, and I was there to take part 
                in the ensuing celebration (which was several hours of three-some 
                sex between us). As things turned out, it was a truly incredible 
                occasion.<p>
                Considering how Lindsay and Trish fell asleep with me here on 
                the bed, sometime in the wee hours of the morning, I naturally 
                wondered where both of them were now. Neither lady was anywhere 
                at all to be found, which was a major disappointment. I had been 
                looking forward to waking up with Lindsay snuggled on one arm, 
                and Trish on the other.<p>
                It is very hard to describe the feeling of what it is like to 
                wake up with two gorgeous, beautiful women all snuggled up close 
                against me. Unfortunately, I did not get to experience that feeling 
                this particular morning.<p>
                Sitting up in bed, I shook my head vigorously, trying to jar the 
                last remnants of tired sleep loose. The digitized alarm clock 
                beside me read 8:54am. Did Lindsay and Trish run off together 
                already? If they did, I thought to myself, I hoped they were still 
                inside the mansion. The rainstorm outside was getting more grim 
                and nasty by the second.<p>
                My senses suddenly came alive when I heard a splash of water from 
                somewhere off to my left side. I looked in that direction, and 
                noticed the restroom door was completely open, with the light 
                on inside. Another splashing noise, followed by Lindsay's unmistakable 
                giggle was all that I needed to hear. She was inside, and I'd 
                wager that Trish was, too.<p>
                Throwing on a pair of shorts which had been laying upon the floor, 
                I got up from the bed and ventured toward the restroom. I knocked 
                on the door first, then stuck my head around the corner and immediately 
                smiled at what I saw.<p>
                Both Lindsay and Trish were seated inside the spacious bathtub, 
                luxuriating in both the feeling of togetherness, and a sea of 
                soapy, thick bubbles. Indeed, a bubble-bath was on the menu here 
                as Lindsay reclined backwards upon Trish's voluptuous, well-developed 
                chest within the bathtub.<p>
                With glowing smiles all around, it was rather obvious how much 
                these two enjoyed being back together. As I have said many times 
                in the past, Lindsay and Trish belonged with each other. This 
                was exactly where they should be.<p>
                &quot;Hi Jeremy,&quot; Lindsay giggled, raising a soapy hand and 
                waving it at me. &quot;You finally wake up? I hope you don't mind 
                us using your tub...&quot;<p>
                &quot;No, not at all,&quot; I replied, my eyes wide as I stared 
                at the duo of blonde goddesses as they were curled together.<p>
                &quot;I wanted to take a shower,&quot; Trish told me. &quot;The 
                big, group shower room in the guest corridor was always a lot 
                of fun during the summer, Jeremy. But Lindsay said her and I could 
                have a lot more fun here, with a private bubble-bath.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Bubble-baths are VERY romantic,&quot; Lindsay said, before 
                turning her head and kissing Trish upon the cheek.<p>
                I smiled at the pair of angels. I preferred all of the ladies 
                to bathe in the group shower room, simply because it promoted 
                even more togetherness amongst them. It also proved to be a wonderful 
                mating grounds for sexual play.<p>
                Lindsay was right, however, in saying that bubble-baths were romantic. 
                So, I did not mind her and Trish borrowing my bathtub for that 
                purpose on this fine morning.<p>
                Their relationship, after all, had been built on romance.<p>
                &quot;How long have you two been awake?&quot; was my next question.<p>
                &quot;I thought both of you would sleep a lot longer today.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I'm still tired out from yesterday, and all those air miles,&quot; 
                Trish commented. &quot;But Lindsay woke me up about an hour ago.&quot; 
                The 25-year-old kissed her young lover's neck and grinned, &quot;She's 
                a little bundle of tireless energy.&quot;<p>
                I smiled at Trish, even though a tiny voice within my mind was 
                wondering why I wasn't awakened too, and invited to this bubble-bath 
                party. On the other hand, however, I realized that Lindsay and 
                Trish had a lot of time to make up. I didn't need to be there 
                every second along the way.<p>
                &quot;It's only an hour until breakfast,&quot; I told them. &quot;It's 
                at ten o'clock sharp, every morning... just like the summer. Are 
                you two going to be able to make it in time?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Lindsay replied. &quot;We'll be there.&quot;<p>
                I smiled at the charming couple once again. &quot;I'll be<p>
                looking for you there, then. I'm sure that Pamela, Torrie and 
                Amy will be looking for you as well, Trish.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I do plan to bury the hatchet with Amy,&quot; Trish said 
                to me. &quot;I don't like what she tried to do with Lindsay in 
                the summer-time, but it's water under the bridge now.&quot;<p>
                &quot;That's the spirit,&quot; I told her, my insides warming. 
                &quot;I hope you and Amy can start over, and be friends again.&quot; 
                I paused and added, &quot;I'll see you two ladies in an hour.&quot;<p>
                I turned to walk away, but Lindsay's voice stopped me.<p>
                &quot;Oh Jeremy?&quot;<p>
                &quot;What is it, dear?&quot; I asked, looking back at her.<p>
                &quot;Trish wanted to apologize,&quot; she replied, to which the<p>
                Canadian squinted her eyes in confusion.<p>
                &quot;For what?&quot; I asked, curious.<p>
                &quot;For bringing this bad weather from Toronto with her!&quot;<p>
                Lindsay said in a jovial, lively voice. &quot;This rain... it's 
                ALL her fault!&quot;<p>
                For her words, Lindsay received a playful smack upside her head 
                - from Trish. The two ladies giggled together in unison while 
                I shook my head in amazement at them. Lindsay and Trish were BORN 
                for each other...</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>Moments before breakfast was slated to begin, Pamela pulled me 
                off to the side for some private words. The remainder of the ladies 
                - including Lindsay and Trish - were all seated at the dining 
                table in the common room. I was very happy to see that Amy and 
                Trish were having a friendly, energetic discussion amongst one 
                another, too...<p>
                &quot;Not to dampen your mood or anything,&quot; Pamela said to 
                me in a low tone, &quot;but Torrie was still in a pretty bad state 
                of mind last night. All she did was cry.&quot;<p>
                I sighed and shook my head in disenchantment at those grave words. 
                &quot;I was afraid that she may still feel that way. I don't think 
                any of us realize how much she loved Lindsay.&quot; I looked at 
                Torrie, who sat quietly at the breakfast table, while everyone 
                else was lively and talking up a storm. &quot;Do you think I should 
                talk to her again?&quot; I asked, turning my attention back to 
                Pamela.<p>
                &quot;No,&quot; my wife answered. &quot;Not yet. I talked to her 
                last night. I just think she needs a little time to get over the 
                fact that she cannot have Lindsay.&quot; Pamela sighed and added, 
                &quot;I was thinking of asking her if she'd like to go on a long 
                nature walk with me today. You know, to help get her mind off 
                of things. But we can't; not with this rain...&quot;<p>
                I pouted for a quick instant, before leaning forward and pecking 
                the tip of her nose with a kiss.<p>
                Pamela was, in many ways, the matriarch of the island. I was proud 
                of her for that fact. Her caring and thoughtful nature extended 
                toward all of the girls, and Pamela would do whatever it took 
                to make sure they were happy and content. That quality was just 
                one of reasons why I loved her so much.<p>
                &quot;Still, you can be with her,&quot; I offered. &quot;You and 
                Torrie always had a good time in the weight room during the summer. 
                Why not go there for some exercise after breakfast?&quot;<p>
                &quot;We are,&quot; Pamela said. &quot;But Trish is going, too. 
                You know, it was the three of us in the weight room almost every 
                single day in the summer-time. We always did have a good time, 
                as you said. Hopefully it can be that way, again.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Is Lindsay going, too?&quot; I asked, already knowing the 
                answer to that question.<p>
                &quot;Of course,&quot; Pamela replied, before cracking a smile. 
                &quot;Trish said we could take turns bench-pressing Lindsay.&quot; 
                I chuckled at the thought, imagining what it would be like to 
                see the frail, 90-something pound teen in that predicament.<p>
                &quot;That would be a sight,&quot; I grinned.<p>
                &quot;Looks like it's time for breakfast,&quot; Pamela said, as 
                our<p>
                75-year-old housekeeper, Louisa, wheeled the big buffet cart into 
                the common room. &quot;Hmmmmm,&quot; Pamela grinned, looking at 
                me. &quot;The food sure does smell yummy this morning.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Did you expect any less, dear?&quot; I asked, incredulously.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>As could be expected, the breakfast buffet which Louisa had prepared 
                for us turned out to be another rousing feast. During the hour-long 
                eating period, Trish was introduced to the three newcomers (Devon, 
                Cassidy and Stephanie), and got better acquainted with them in 
                the process. In addition, Trish and Amy continued to get along 
                in a fine fashion. I was, perhaps, most happy for that.<p>
                Unfortunately, one woman who didn't seem to get all that involved 
                in the lively discussion was, of course, Torrie. For most of breakfast, 
                she sat silently by with a somber expression upon her face, and 
                didn't say much of anything.<p>
                I did detect a moment of extreme jealousy from Torrie, however, 
                when Lindsay threw her arms around Trish for an energetic, spirited 
                embrace. Stephanie was telling a joke at the time, and everyone 
                was laughing - except Torrie and myself. While I found the joke 
                funny, I felt sick inside because Torrie was in the midst of getting 
                beaten mentally.<p>
                Seeing the look on her face as Lindsay and Trish shared a hug 
                almost felt like someone had stuck a dagger in my heart.<p>
                However, no one else seemed to notice. Only Pamela, Lindsay and 
                yours truly were aware of Torrie's feelings concerning the 19-year-old. 
                The three of us had promised to keep it a secret from everyone 
                else - including Trish. We figured that if Torrie wanted the others 
                to know of her pain and anguish, she would offer the information 
                herself.<p>
                One person who sensed Torrie's negative mood, albeit a bit late, 
                was Pamela. Pamela was having such a good time during the conversation 
                with the other ladies that it took her awhile to catch on to Torrie's 
                state of mind. When she did, however, Pamela's mood matched mine 
                - concern.<p>
                My wife and I made eye contact, and the look on her face told 
                me that something needed to be done here - and soon. Otherwise, 
                Torrie will have dug herself so deep a hole, it may take her several 
                years to climb out of it.<p>
                Remembering my ex-fiancee, I knew the feeling too well...</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>Seated in my personal suite, several hours later, I could not 
                believe the thoughts which were going through my mind. All of 
                these women - Torrie, Pamela, Lindsay, Devon, Trish, Amy, Cassidy 
                and Stephanie, as well as Lisa, Christina and even Gianna before 
                them - were absolute angels to me. Each of them had improved my 
                life in varying ways. They meant the absolute world to me. Losing 
                any single one of them, for whatever reason, would be simply devastating.<p>
                Why was I going to ask Torrie if she wanted to go home?<p>
                I wrestled with the thought in my mind, but not for long. Torrie 
                could not go on like this - pining over Lindsay while seeing her 
                so happy with Trish at the same time - all that much longer. It 
                would destroy her.<p>
                I thought at first that she may be able to fight through this, 
                but now it was pretty apparent that was not going to be the case. 
                Torrie was being mutilated inside over this.<p>
                I could say that I was going to ask Torrie if she wanted to go 
                home because of the other ladies, as well. Torrie could, quite 
                possibly, put a damper on the upcoming holiday season with her 
                sulky attitude. Plus, she could eventually cause a rift in the 
                relationship between Lindsay and Trish.<p>
                However, those were NOT my reasons. I was thinking ONLY of Torrie, 
                and her well-being. Nothing else factored into my thoughts on 
                the subject. I wanted her to be happy but as things seemed now, 
                she was in the deepest depths of despair.<p>
                On the other hand, if Torrie went home, would things be any better 
                for her? According to the discussion I had with the 26-year-old 
                just two days ago, it didn't seem that way. Torrie had lost a 
                great deal of her friends because of her decision to get into 
                porn, and her family frowned upon her because of it, too. Was 
                there anything to go home to?<p>
                If she left the island, Torrie wouldn't have to deal with the 
                pain of seeing Lindsay - the one person she loves - with Trish 
                any longer. At the same time, however, Torrie would be right back 
                in a place - California - where she felt she was no longer welcome.<p>
                I always try to look at things in a positive light... but this 
                sure did look like a no-win situation.<p>
                Thus, I made the decision to give Torrie the choice as to whether 
                or not she wanted to return home, to Los Angeles. Considering 
                the circumstances, I also decided that Torrie would receive the 
                full $3,000,000 - her scheduled earnings for spending the whole 
                winter on the island - despite the fact she had only been here 
                for a week. Perhaps she could use the money to move elsewhere, 
                and start over in life...</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>After checking on Torrie's whereabouts with the help of my voyeur 
                room, I went directly to the recreation area. The beautiful, statuesque 
                blonde was there, reading a magazine while perched upon the sofa.<p>
                As could be expected, Torrie's overall mood and demeanor had not 
                improved all that much since breakfast.<p>
                &quot;Hi sweetheart,&quot; I quietly said, approaching her slowly 
                while offering a friendly smile. &quot;Can I have a minute?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Sure,&quot; she sighed, placing the magazine down.<p>
                &quot;You're obviously not in a very good state of mind right<p>
                now,&quot; I said, taking a seat next to her. I grabbed ahold 
                of Torrie's hand and looked directly into her eyes. &quot;I know 
                that you were incredibly hurt, sweetheart, by what happened between 
                you and Lindsay.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Incredibly hurt does not describe it,&quot; Torrie offered.<p>
                &quot;It doesn't even BEGIN to describe it.&quot; I nodded my 
                head. &quot;I just wish that Lindsay and I could be together. 
                Don't worry, though. I'll get over it. Eventually. I hope...&quot;<p>
                I flashed her a faint (hopeless) smile. &quot;It sure doesn't 
                seem that way, sweetheart. You're all down in the dumps.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yeah...&quot; she agreed, her voice trailing off. &quot;Maybe 
                so.<p>
                But I think you can understand the reason why.&quot;<p>
                I took a deep breath and then let it out slowly. Yes, I understood 
                her feelings all too well.<p>
                &quot;I am trying to be happy for Lindsay and Trish,&quot; Torrie 
                added. &quot;And, I am. I want Lindsay to be happy. I just wish 
                I was the one who made her happy, instead of Trish.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I can't believe that I'm about to say this, Torrie,&quot; 
                were my words. &quot;I care about you... I love you. I love all 
                of you girls. But I can't stand to see you unhappy.&quot; I paused 
                and continued, &quot;This is hard to say... but, I feel it is 
                necessary. Would... you be better off, if you were...&quot;<p>
                In mid-sentence, my words were cut off by the sound of someone 
                knocking on the door to the recreation room. Torrie and I looked 
                over immediately, and saw the duo of Pamela and Lindsay standing 
                in the doorway.<p>
                &quot;Hi there,&quot; Pamela said, smiling and waving her hand 
                in greeting toward us. &quot;I see you two are having a talk, 
                but Lindsay here... she has something to say to Torrie. Is it 
                okay if we come in?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Of course,&quot; I said, wondering what this could be.<p>
                &quot;Hi Lindsay,&quot; Torrie said, offering a half-hearted smile.<p>
                The 19-year-old's smile, on the other hand, was unique<p>
                and heartfelt. She approached Torrie, and stood above her. &quot;Hi 
                Torrie,&quot; Lindsay returned, dropping down to a crouched position 
                so she and the blonde could look eye-to-eye. &quot;Let me get 
                straight to the point. I appreciate the fact that you told me 
                about your feelings. You love me... and I care about you. I care 
                about you a great, great deal.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You care about Trish a whole lot more, though,&quot; Torrie 
                said. &quot;It's okay, though. Well... not really. I just wish 
                that you and me could be together. I really do.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I was in love with Trish the very first moment I saw her,&quot; 
                Lindsay remarked.<p>
                &quot;And I was in love with you when I first saw you, too,&quot; 
                Torrie said to Lindsay, in exasperation.<p>
                The teen-ager closed her eyes for a moment, perhaps lost in thought. 
                When she opened them, she looked squarely at Torrie and said, 
                &quot;I've talked with both Pamela and Trish.&quot; Pamela smiled 
                at those words as Lindsay continued, &quot;All of us think that 
                it would be best if you, Torrie, were to move back into the same 
                room with me... and Trish.&quot;<p>
                Torrie's eyes were wide and bulging in response to those words. 
                In fact, she didn't even have anything to say at first. Perhaps 
                Torrie was too surprised, or stunned?<p>
                &quot;Trish doesn't know a thing about how you're feeling,&quot; 
                Lindsay added, patting Torrie's wrist with her hand. &quot;I talked 
                to her, and she said it would be great if you moved in with us. 
                You and her have always gotten along real good together.&quot; 
                The little blonde paused, then smiled. &quot;All of us could be 
                together. And who knows? Maybe you, me and Trish... maybe we could 
                all grow to love each other, too.&quot;<p>
                Torrie's eyes were not the only ones which were about to burst. 
                Mine were, too. This was quite a nice surprise...<p>
                &quot;What do you say, Torrie?&quot; Lindsay asked, standing up 
                and extending her hand. &quot;Would you like that? Would you like 
                to move in with me and Trish, and be our roomy?&quot; Lindsay 
                punctuated those words by offering perhaps the sweetest, most 
                genuine smile I had EVER seen in my life.<p>
                It took a few seconds, but Torrie eventually smiled and nodded 
                her head in acceptance.<p>
                She grabbed ahold of Lindsay's hand and said, &quot;I'd love that, 
                honey.&quot; Torrie stood up, and traded a series of smiles with 
                Lindsay, then Pamela, and Lindsay yet again.<p>
                The two ladies hooked their arms together and turned to walk away, 
                but Torrie stopped and looked back at me.<p>
                &quot;What were you going to say to me, Jeremy?&quot; she asked.<p>
                &quot;OH!&quot; I returned, being so overjoyed that I momentarily<p>
                forgot what I had come here for. That would be, of course, to 
                ask Torrie if she wanted to return home. &quot;It was nothing 
                important, dear,&quot; I said to her. &quot;Nothing at all.&quot;<p>
                Torrie flashed me a charming smile, then turned her head and walked 
                out of the room with Lindsay - going arm-in-arm.<p>
                &quot;I'll catch up with you two later,&quot; Pamela said, calling 
                out to the pair of ladies.<p>
                With a big smile upon my face - and a tremendous amount of relief 
                and joy within my heart - I turned toward Pamela and shook my 
                head in amazement.<p>
                &quot;This was all your doing... wasn't it?&quot; I said to her, 
                my smile wide and looming.<p>
                &quot;Not all of it,&quot; she replied. &quot;I simply... SUGGESTED... 
                to Lindsay that she talk to Trish, and see if it would be okay 
                if Torrie moved in with them. Lindsay doesn't want to see Torrie 
                all sad and depressed. She cares about Torrie.&quot;<p>
                I smiled, knowing my wonderful wife was the driving force behind 
                this. &quot;What are you going to do for a room-mate?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Oh, I don't know,&quot; Pamela replied. &quot;Maybe I can 
                do what we did at the end of the summer. Whatever girl spends 
                the night with you... I'll stay with her room-mate. That means, 
                just like you... I get a different girl every night, too.&quot;<p>
                I smiled at her and said, &quot;Quite the creative one, huh?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I don't know if this will solve all of the problems that<p>
                Torrie is having,&quot; Pamela commented. &quot;Her moving in 
                with Trish and Lindsay... it could backfire. But I think it was 
                the only thing that we could do. Torrie was so unhappy.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Let's hope it doesn't backfire,&quot; I said, crossing my 
                fingers and holding them before my wife's lovely face. &quot;Hopefully 
                all three of them can fall in love, together. Seeing Torrie smile 
                now... I think it was the first TRUE smile I have seen from her 
                in the past couple of days.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Speaking of that rotation system,&quot; Pamela cooed, &quot;just 
                who is on your menu tonight, Jeremy?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Devon,&quot; I replied, gulping my throat at the prospect.<p>
                &quot;Oh,&quot; Pamela grinned. &quot;I'm sure you'll love that.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Maybe,&quot; I told her, my tone uneven.<p>
                Devon was going to have some questions to answer tonight, concerning 
                her prior comments about not only Pamela and yours truly, but 
                our marriage as well. Was she a problem?<p>
                Anyone who posed any sort of a threat to my relationship with 
                Pamela... well, they were not welcome on my island. I was going 
                to get some straight answers from Devon - TONIGHT.</p>
