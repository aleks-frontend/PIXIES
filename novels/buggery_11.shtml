              <p>Buttercup was less keen on prostitution than Tracey, although 
                she was actually substantially more successful at it. In fact, 
                this may have been part of what she didn't like. She never seemed 
                to have enough time to recover between one encounter and the next. 
                But she did at least twice as well as Tracey, and not just because 
                she had more customers. Often her clients were so grateful to 
                meet someone as genuinely beautiful as her as to give many times 
                more than was absolutely necessary for the services she provided.<p>
                And the mechanics of prostitution was so very different here in 
                Gomorrah to what happened back home. Although of course for Buttercup 
                there had been no equivalent to prostitution in her life in Buggery, 
                and she had nothing to compare it to. In the absence of clothes 
                and make-up or even tottering high-heels, the only thing that 
                marked out a prostitute was the fact of where they were and how 
                long they hung around. Most Gomorran women kept their distance 
                from the world of men, fearing that they'd be raped or arrested 
                or beaten up. Only prostitutes had any license to encroach at 
                all on male preserves, and then only on the very margins of it. 
                Along main roads in the wilderness, at the very edges of towns 
                and cities, by desolate industrial wastelands. And there they 
                would stand, or sit, Tracey and Buttercup amongst them actively 
                seeking out the men's attention.<p>
                There were no laws against prostitution in Gomorrah, although 
                Tracey got to learn from her clients that there were still stigmas 
                associated with it. A man wouldn't boast that he'd seen a prostitute, 
                although he might boast about the sex he'd had as if it were a 
                different transaction altogether. Furthermore, as women were not 
                allowed by law to have any possessions, they could only ever be 
                given things. Never money or anything like that. Not that either 
                Tracey or Buttercup had any use for money. Women weren't permitted 
                into shops and money wasn't used as currency in the community 
                where they lived. Any potential client offering just money had 
                to be turned down. Those notes with the president's head on them 
                and the pictures of Gomorran industry and Gomorran war victories, 
                they were totally worthless in the world of women.<p>
                It was relatively easy to identify men who were looking for sex. 
                They would be carrying plastic bags of groceries, a couple of 
                unopened bottles of wine, or unwrapped cigarette packets. And 
                they would pass Tracey and Buttercup with eyes which were evaluating 
                them and comparing them with other women they'd passed, to decide 
                whether they wanted to fuck them. Or they might be cruising slowly 
                past in their cars, most of which were of a far poorer quality 
                than Tracey knew from back home, the windows wound down, as the 
                occupants decided whether they should or not.<p>
                But it was for Tracey and Buttercup to make the advances most 
                of the time: a situation that at first Buttercup resented but 
                then actually came to appreciate as she realised that it was actually 
                her opportunity to turn down men she didn't want,. Although Tracey 
                wasn't at all sure she liked the sex as much as she did. Tracey 
                had always liked cock. OK! She wasn't too keen on cock when it 
                was thrust in her when she didn't want it. But cock as a whole 
                was fucking magic. She didn't mind too much what pathetic individual 
                was on the other end of the cock. She liked the taste of it. She 
                liked it inside her. She liked it when the cock exploded in all 
                that come, which might drip out of her twat, or seep through the 
                gaps in her clasped fist round a cock, or get spat out of her 
                mouth. It was cock. It was cock up her arse, in her cunt, in her 
                mouth and, for less than five minutes, in her hand.<p>
                However, she had sex wherever circumstances dictated, and what 
                they mostly dictated was no modesty at all. Like all the other 
                girls along the road side, under the tall lamp-posts, or in the 
                shadows of the factories and garages, it was on the ground, in 
                the grass, against the wall, just whatever happened to be there. 
                Nobody was concerned about their modesty. And, anyway, what modesty 
                was there? She and all the girls were already showing all they 
                had to offer, although the more desperate girls would prise open 
                their cunt lips to the men as they passed by, the better to advertise 
                what they had to offer. It was the men who were showing more flesh 
                than usual, but normally it was only the flesh between the tails 
                of their shirts and the undone belts of the trousers below their 
                knees. Their pricks were generally hidden by fist, mouth, cunt 
                or arse. And their hairy, flabby buttocks were no advertisement 
                to any but the most desperate of men of a certain proclivity.<p>
                The most comfortable and the most lucrative of fucks were those 
                in the back of cars, although even to someone as na&iuml;ve of 
                the nature of economics as Tracey it was fairly clear that car 
                ownership was nowhere near as universal in Gomorrah as it was 
                back home. These were driven by men who were rather better dressed 
                than the average client, even though the cars scarcely spoke to 
                Tracey of great luxury. Often the cars carried more than one man, 
                and very often were picking up more than one woman. Buttercup 
                attracted an unusually high proportion of clients in cars, which 
                earned her both the envy and the respect of the other girls, although 
                she wasn't really aware of it. In fact, several cars became almost 
                regular visitors: Buttercup knowing who she was about to fuck 
                just by the sight and sound of some beaten-up vehicle with the 
                license plate almost hanging off and the dent on the bumper. <p>
                Tracey's favourite fucks were those with Buttercup when the two 
                of them were picked up together and provided sexual services to 
                the men for material rewards and to each other for pleasure. These 
                were the only time that the lovers were ever able to enjoy the 
                flesh and passion of each others' bodies, aware also that their 
                mutual lovemaking in some peculiar way actually gave pleasure 
                to the men who'd picked them up. This slightly puzzled Tracey. 
                She'd never seen anything very erotic or exciting about watching 
                two men fucking each other, and those few times in Gomorrah where 
                she'd witnessed it filled her with about as much sexual passion 
                as watching two dogs doing it. But somehow men were different 
                that way. And what was even more strange was that for doing what 
                she and Buttercup liked doing anyway, but usually by themselves, 
                they actually got more at the end of the session than if they'd 
                just let the men fuck them. This particularly confused Buttercup 
                who had no sense of distinction between sex with a man or sex 
                with a woman, and thought watching anyone else having sex, in 
                whatever combination, was at best boring and at worst frustrating.<p>
                Sometimes they were driven a distance from the lamp-post or wall 
                they'd been picked up from. Usually they were driven back after 
                the men's business was done, but not always, which was difficult 
                for the two girls in finding their way back in a country that 
                was still mostly alien to them. These were the only times that 
                Tracey saw more of the male world of Gomorrah than just the edges 
                of it where women were permitted to wander. The male world she 
                could see through the car windows was very similar to the world 
                Tracey came from. In fact, depressingly similar as they more resembled 
                the run-down estates, unexciting shopping precincts and shoddy 
                high streets of the parts of her world back home where she actually 
                lived and socialised. None of it seemed to have any of the opulence 
                and grandeur of foreign cities and resorts that she'd ever seen 
                in holiday brochures. And all you could ever see in the streets 
                were men. And men dressed almost exactly as they were back home. 
                If anything they dressed even worse than that, showing even less 
                concern for how ill-fitting their trousers were, or how inappropriately 
                coloured their shirts or ties might be, or how ugly their shoes 
                were. They would be hanging around outside pubs, standing around 
                by bookmakers, sitting on walls by off-licences and liquor stores, 
                smoking cigarettes, drinking from cans of beer in six- or four-packs, 
                and quite often brawling with each other. Tracey thought, as she 
                glimpsed these sights, that even if these areas weren't out of 
                bounds to women, it would be a strange woman who'd want to be 
                out there in this male-only preserve. The men looked like trouble. 
                If they couldn't rape you then they'd probably want to beat you 
                up.<p>
                And then the car would be parked somewhere relatively quiet where 
                there no men to watch what was going on and the man or the men 
                who'd picked the girls up would gain the satisfaction they were 
                so keen on. Seats would be pushed back, cigarette packets and 
                magazines pushed onto the ground and new stains would be added 
                to those already splattered on the polyvinyl or velour of the 
                seats' coverings. Pricks would go into the mouth, into the cunt 
                and buttocks would thrust back and forth while the men grunted, 
                snarled or moaned in the way that they always did. And after usually 
                not too many minutes, out would spurt the semen which was the 
                obvious object of the men's exertions, most often on the girls' 
                bodies or faces, but sometimes down the throat, in the dark recesses 
                of the cunts or in the tight confines of their arses.<p>
                For Tracey there was sometimes, but not always, some pleasure 
                to be got from all this cock. Not all cock was horrible, and some 
                men were better at fucking than others. She sometimes enjoyed 
                the familiar warm, hard stiffness of the cocks, that jerking spasm 
                as the cocks ejaculated, that slow floppiness that the punctuated 
                cocks relapsed into. But none of this matched those few snatched 
                kisses or caresses she enjoyed with Buttercup if she were there. 
                No man could compare to Buttercup for the passion it aroused in 
                her and the sheer pleasure of merely touching her, let alone the 
                peaks of ecstasy their lovemaking visited on her.<p>
                Although compared to most women in the community, Tracey and Buttercup 
                were now relatively well-off, Tracey could see that it was not 
                bringing her lover nearly as much satisfaction as it did her. 
                Buttercup did seem to enjoy the company of some men much more 
                than others, but these were those few men who would actually talk 
                to her rather than just use her as an object of their lust. Tracey's 
                views were quite different. She'd rather the men just got on with 
                it than bored her with talk about how tedious their jobs were, 
                how much they wished it was possible to get to know women better, 
                or how they hated the prospect of military service. However, Buttercup's 
                patience meant that she learnt more about Gomorran life from a 
                male perspective than Tracey ever did. And strangely enough, she 
                felt rather less contempt for the men than Tracey who minded their 
                sexual predation less than her.<p>
                &quot;Gomorrah might be a country for men, run by men and for 
                the interests of men,&quot; Buttercup mused, as the two walked 
                back to the community laden down with the spoils of their activities, 
                &quot;but I don't think it's really what men want.&quot;<p>
                &quot;That's fucking crap!&quot; retorted Tracey. &quot;Those 
                cunts vote for it. That's what they say they want. And that's 
                what they fucking get.&quot;<p>
                &quot;It might be what they think they want. But it's not really 
                what they want. They've sort of trapped themselves. By denying 
                women of any say or any rights, they've made a society where the 
                only sex they can have is sex they pay for, and the only love 
                they ever get is that they get from the friendship of other men. 
                And men together don't seem very good at dealing with their feelings 
                or their wants. They go on about things like cars, booze, sport 
                and fighting in the war, but there's no space in their life for 
                other things.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Like fucking what?&quot; sneered Tracey. &quot;Flowers and 
                nature and things?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well, yes. Or anything like that. It's like they're only 
                half people, with only half lives.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well! Fuck them! They're not that much better back home 
                where they've got no fucking excuses. And here it's not like they 
                treat as well or anything. They've fucking raped us when they 
                couldn't get what they want with cigarettes or whatever. They 
                treat us like fucking shit. They treat all women like shit. They're 
                the ones with the fucking power. It's for them to make their lives 
                fucking better. Or the lives of us women better either. Men are 
                just fucking pigs!&quot;<p>
                &quot;That's not true,&quot; Buttercup protested mildly. &quot;Some 
                of the men I've met are quite gentle. If they could have relationships 
                like we have,&quot; she squeezed Tracey's hand tight and leaned 
                her head onto her shoulder, despite the weight of the plastic 
                bags she was carrying, &quot;then there's no reason why they wouldn't 
                be better.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I know what it's like,&quot; spat Tracey angrily. &quot;Remember 
                I come from a normal country. Not some fucking wierdie place where 
                women have to go round starkers all the time like here. Or stick 
                rings in their bald cunts like in Buggery. I come from a normal 
                place. And men ain't got no fucking excuse. And they're still 
                fucking horrible!&quot; Tracey heard herself speak, and paused 
                abruptly. &quot;Fuck! I'm beginning to sound like some fucking 
                dyke feminist or something. I'm not gonna be burning my bra. Not 
                that I've got one to burn. Men are men. You just can't fucking 
                expect them to be better.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I just don't believe that,&quot; said Buttercup optimistically.<p>
                Tracey reflected. She loved Buttercup. She didn't want there to 
                be an inch of difference between them. &quot;Yeah, you're right! 
                I guess it's 'cos I've been in this fucking hell hole too long. 
                I can see why the women here hate the men so much. But I guess 
                even back home there are some men that aren't such fucking pigs. 
                And there'd be a lot fewer pigs here if the men didn't run things 
                the way they do.&quot;<p>
                Buttercup let her bags drop. She could see what an effort it cost 
                Tracey to do any reflection or thinking outside her normal confines. 
                Although she loved her tourist lover deeply, she recognised the 
                girl's intellectual shortcomings and the fact that even in the 
                land of plenty, she'd not had quite the plenty that others living 
                there had. She put both arms around Tracey, and drew her close 
                to her breast and kissed her all over the cheek, chin and eyes.<p>
                &quot;As long as we have each other,&quot; Buttercup declared 
                between kisses, &quot;I'm happy. Whatever indignities the bastards 
                heap on us. However awful the sex and however humble our lodgings, 
                while I have you I'm happy and contented.&quot;<p>
                Tracey wept with pleasure and desire at Buttercup's declaration 
                of love, but she knew that in truth her lover was not happy and 
                contented. Although life was better as a prostitute than as a 
                factory-worker, and the sex, if anything, less humiliating, Buttercup 
                could never be happy and contented in the lifestyle she was leading. 
                And for her, the cost of her beauty in a country where it merely 
                attracted more attention actually outweighed for her its actual 
                benefits. And she felt at an even deeper level, that in a real 
                sense she wasn't really worthy of the love of such a beautiful 
                woman. Would it last a moment back home where Buttercup could 
                more easily compare her to other people?<p>
                But for the moment, she had no complaints, as the two girls sunk 
                onto the grass under the moonlight, their bodies against each 
                other and despite the tears that smeared Tracey's face the familiar 
                rhythms of true passion rose in their mutual embraces.<p>
                XX </p>
              <p>Although Sharon had no sexual desires for Sweetness, she felt 
                great responsibility for the girl. After all, she was blind and 
                even more helpless in this strange country than she was. What 
                would happen to Sweetness if she abandoned her? How could the 
                girl feed or fend for herself? So, she decided that for the purposes 
                of convenience alone, and because it was what was expected of 
                them, she should present their friendship as being a mistress/slave 
                one of the type that appeared to be the norm in Sodom. It provided 
                an excuse for her to continue to take care of the girl, and might 
                even protect the two of them from any worse advances from other 
                people. She explained this to Sweetness, and tried to stress that 
                there was no real meaning to the relationship.<p>
                &quot;I'm not a fucking dyke, you know,&quot; she stressed to 
                Sweetness as they lay together on the mattress in Faith's spare 
                bedroom.<p>
                &quot;But I still love you,&quot; sniffed Sweetness. &quot;Can't 
                you love me in return?&quot;<p>
                Sharon could say no, but she was aware that their relationship 
                was not totally innocent. Sweetness wrapped her naked body around 
                her, and stroked and cuddled her, which Sharon reciprocated as 
                long as their fingers never probed their crotches and there were 
                no tongues involved. &quot;We can cuddle, but that's fucking all!&quot; 
                she insisted.<p>
                However, she quite enjoyed helping Sweetness. Somehow, this role 
                as Sweetness' carer had awakened in her feelings of responsibility 
                she didn't know she had. Every morning, she would carefully shave 
                Sweetness' head, just as she did herself and tenderly thread the 
                chains and rings into her pierced nipple and clitoris: tasks which 
                blindness made nearly impossible for the girl. Her heart would 
                sometimes melt as she regarded Sweetness' vacant gaze in her direction 
                as she washed the last signs of stubble off the girl's pate. On 
                such occasions, she would tenderly kiss Sweetness on the lips 
                and then curse herself for giving the girl cause to expect more 
                of her than she was willing to give. Sharon had started to get 
                quite used to this look of baldness and the array of chains. In 
                fact, as she regarded her own face in the mirror as she carefully 
                shaved the back of her head, she wondered what it might be to 
                have hair again. What did it feel like to have all that stuff 
                sprouting out of the top of the head, over the ears and onto the 
                shoulder? And what was it like to wear clothes, rather than have 
                chains pulling down relentlessly on the nipples and cunt, so often 
                giving her inappropriate feelings whenever one was accidentally 
                tugged or brushed?<p>
                Faith was happy for Sharon and Sweetness to stay in her spare 
                bedroom, but she wasn't a wealthy woman so she did what she could 
                to persuade Sharon to find work. &quot;In this country,&quot; 
                she reminded Sharon, &quot;a mistress is expected to provide for 
                her slave. There are plenty of jobs in the local newspaper, so 
                have a look there.&quot;<p>
                Sharon agreed, taking the copy of the Holiness Evening Advertiser 
                that Faith had handed her and browsed through the pages. It was 
                remarkably dull. Every page was nothing but newsprint, with no 
                photographs or cartoons of any kind. She commented on this to 
                Faith.<p>
                &quot;Illustrations of any kind are forbidden by the Sodomite 
                religion,&quot; Faith told them sternly. &quot;I suppose it's 
                different where you are, but here it is firmly forbidden to see 
                images, painted, drawn, filmed or photographed.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Is that why you have no telly?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I've no idea what you mean,&quot; sighed Faith impatiently. 
                <p>
                &quot;No television. Just a radio,&quot; continued Sharon, noting 
                Faith's blank expression. &quot;Oh never mind.&quot; <p>
                Faith sighed again and returned to the book she was reading. However, 
                now that it was mentioned to her, Sharon reflected that she hadn't 
                seen any images or pictures anywhere. This was one distinct difference 
                between Sodom and back home, as well as the funny religion and 
                the weird way you were expected to dress. She was sure she'd find 
                more such differences, but it seemed weird to her that people 
                exposed themselves in a way that would get you arrested back home, 
                but were prudish about something as harmless as pictures. What 
                were these people on?<p>
                There were many jobs advertised, and many of them were just like 
                jobs she'd had back home. It was reassuring to see that there 
                were jobs like factory workers, toilet attendants, security guards 
                and computer programmers, just like she would see in jobs advertisements 
                back home. She had no real idea where to begin looking, but she 
                ringed a few who paid more Sodomite dollars than the others. It 
                was those boring jobs in offices like sorting out files and answering 
                the phone where there was most demand, and she'd soon had a few 
                advertisements ringed in biro, and a few interviews arranged using 
                Faith's telephone. <p>
                Seeing Sharon busy at work, Faith abandoned her book and made 
                some tea and biscuits. Sharon could see that Faith's grumpiness 
                was probably still to do with the fact that Sharon didn't want 
                to have sex with her, but, fuck it! Faith could have sex with 
                Sweetness any time. All she had to do was ask. <p>
                Finally, Sharon arranged an interview which was for a clerical 
                job with a shipping company, and set off across the city for the 
                interview which was to be that very afternoon. She asked Faith 
                how she should dress for the interview, which caused her a little 
                amusement. &quot;Just as you are,&quot; she said with a laugh, 
                but nonetheless loaned Sharon a dangling pearl cunt ring to make 
                her look slightly smarter. She also recommended that Sharon take 
                Sweetness with her, as interviewers tended to look more favourably 
                on applicants with steady relationships. She lent Sharon a chain 
                with which to lead Sweetness: the same one, she remarked ruefully, 
                that she'd used on her own slave.<p>
                Sharon was still finding life in Sodom curiously like normal life 
                after her ordeal in Buggery. Here were city streets, shops, buses 
                and all the accompaniments of civilised life. But the differences 
                were becoming clearer to her. And not just the bizarre way that 
                everyone dressed, and the disproportionately large number of people 
                with missing fingers, tongues or other parts of their body. Now 
                that it had been drawn to her attention, she was aware of the 
                total lack of images around her. Advertisements were in text only, 
                and there were no signs of illustration even in shop windows. 
                She found her way to the block of offices where she was to be 
                interviewed by bus, which was full of people of all ages, children 
                and old people, dressed only in chains and rings threaded through 
                their body. Not many had their tongues removed or their vaginas 
                sewn up or their testicles removed, as with the Sodomite pilgrims, 
                but several were, and she noticed that they were generally treated 
                with quite exaggerated respect.<p>
                Sharon was at first rather unhappy with having pull Sweetness 
                along by a chain, worried that her ward could so easily get hurt 
                finding her way through all the people, but she was a girl who 
                was more than accustomed to her disability, and held onto Sharon's 
                arm for support. There were many other couples like her: sometimes 
                a man leading another man on all fours, or a woman pulling a man 
                along by a chain through his nose, or a woman slapping a man as 
                he cowered under her open palm, or other women like her dragging 
                another woman about. It was fairly obvious who was the mistress 
                and who was the slave. Clearly, Sodom wasn't a country that practised 
                equal relationships.<p>
                Sharon waited with Sweetness in the reception area of the office 
                for a short while, leaving Sweetness behind when she was called 
                for her interview which was with a rather stout short man who 
                might have been balding if it were possible to say in a country 
                where everyone appeared to be bald. The interview was cordial 
                and brief as the man asked her about her office skills and what 
                jobs she'd had in the past. He was particularly impressed by the 
                fact that Sharon had come from another country.<p>
                &quot;We get very few foreigners in Sodom, and fewer still who 
                choose to settle here,&quot; he mused. &quot;There are the pilgrims 
                from other countries who come here to see the Holy relics and 
                the Holy shrines. Otherwise, there are hardly any at all. But 
                I hear that you foreigners have some fairly outlandish customs. 
                Is it true for instance that you don't shave yourselves back where 
                you come from?&quot;<p>
                &quot;The men do. But mostly just the face. And the women do, 
                but mostly the legs and under the arms.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You mean the men don't even shave their legs and armpits!&quot; 
                exclaimed the interviewer, whose skin, like everyone else, was 
                smooth and hairless. &quot;Truly, it sounds like you come from 
                a very strange place. Hairy people everywhere. And you even have 
                films and something called the 'cinema'. Don't your religions 
                proscribe anything?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Religion isn't that important back home. And most religious 
                people do things very differently to how religious people do things 
                here.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I imagine they would. I wouldn't call myself a religious 
                man, although I've been baptised,&quot; he displayed his truncated 
                third finger, &quot;but I'm glad that Sodom is a religious country, 
                where our morals are protected by our religious leaders.&quot; 
                He sniffed, and glanced at a plaque on the wall which held ornate 
                text which Sharon could see read 'To be humble is good. To suffer 
                divine'. &quot;However, you seem like a good girl to me. And you're 
                not flaunting any strange foreign customs that might upset my 
                staff. I see you even have a slave. Is she from Sodom or did you 
                bring her from where you come from?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Neither. She comes from Buggery.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Buggery. We've fought so many wars with them over the years. 
                So much of their kingdom is land which once belonged to the Sodomite 
                people. They have taken advantage of our people's aversion to 
                war and unnecessary suffering. A Sodomite principle is never to 
                cause pain to anyone who doesn't expressly ask for it. These Buggerians 
                don't seem to have any scruples at all on that front.&quot; He 
                frowned severely, and then smiled. &quot;Well, your slave seems 
                a pleasant enough girl. Blind as well. Is that for religious reasons?&quot;<p>
                Sharon shook her head. &quot;She's always been like that.&quot;<p>
                The interviewer sighed. &quot;Disability without choice is such 
                a sad thing. Anyway, when can you start? We have excellent facilities 
                for slaves while their mistresses, or masters for that matter, 
                are at work. We'd really like someone to start as soon as possible.&quot;<p>
                Sharon eagerly accepted the offer, and for the first time since 
                she'd left home she felt there was some structure returning to 
                her life. She was earning money and was able to pay Faith for 
                her keep in the flat, and was able to settle down to a new routine. 
                Not that there was much else to spend her money on. Holiness had 
                no pubs, night clubs or cinemas. All there was were coffee and 
                tea shops, and the restaurants were fairly few and not particularly 
                good. So, after a day at work there was nothing much else to do, 
                but to return to Faith's flat. In this way, life in Sodom was 
                significantly less exciting than back home. But otherwise, Sharon 
                was feeling happier than she'd done for a long time. Mind you, 
                the actual Sodomite dollar was a strange thing. Like everything 
                else, there were no images on it, just beautifully ornate Sodomite 
                phrases. On the twenty dollar note it read: 'Deliverance Through 
                Pain'. The fifty dollar note read: 'Redemption is Achieved Through 
                Blood, Sweat and Piss'. And the hundred dollar note, which was 
                barely worth as much as a cup of coffee, read: 'Grace, Peace and 
                Humiliation.'<p>
                Her job in the office was not especially exciting. The computers 
                she had to work on were distinctly more primitive than any she'd 
                seen at any office she'd worked in at home, and there was certainly 
                no Internet access. The work was certainly no more interesting, 
                but it kept her occupied. She worked opposite a thin girl, Humility, 
                with a pointed chin and wide, child-like eyes. Next to her was 
                a rather fat man, Surrender, whose chains were partly held in 
                place by a thick ring in his navel. On the other side was a middle-aged 
                woman, Sacrifice, whose sagging pointed breasts and nipples were 
                dragged down quite sharply by the weights which dangled from them, 
                and had her tongue removed and so could therefore only communicate 
                by sign-language which Sharon had absolutely no facility in.<p>
                She brought Sweetness into the office every day, like everyone 
                else who had a slave, and sat her on a cushion chained to her 
                desk just between Sacrifice and herself. Sacrifice had her own 
                slave, a thin young man with persistent blue stubble on his cheeks 
                and chin, and whose tongue was also removed. Not much chance of 
                conversation there. It had to be said that Sweetness seemed to 
                have a natural ability in her new role, even though Sharon was 
                initially rather uneasy about it. Perhaps because of her sightlessness 
                she didn't really see it as the humiliation that Sharon recognised 
                it as. In any case, her life up till then had scarcely been especially 
                empowering. Slaves had a strange role to play it seemed. They 
                had to ask permission for anything they wanted to do, however 
                trivial, and to accept without question petty humiliations and 
                refusals. They also were expected to give sexual favours whenever 
                requested and accept beatings for the most arbitrary reasons. 
                Sharon had no intention on visiting any harm on her ward, which 
                in itself raised comment from the other staff.<p>
                &quot;You're very lenient on your slave,&quot; remarked Humility. 
                &quot;Don't you ever slap her? I've not seen you piss on her or 
                spank her or discipline her in any way. Don't people do things 
                like that back where you come from?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Not often,&quot; admitted Sharon.<p>
                &quot;Despite my name I've never been very keen on being a slave,&quot; 
                Humility confided. &quot;I tried it for a while. But I didn't 
                really enjoy it. And I've tried being a mistress and I was crap 
                at that as well. Just not stern enough. Do you think there's something 
                wrong with me?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Not at all,&quot; said Sharon. Humility placed a hand on 
                Sharon's crotch and squeezed it. Sharon pushed it off abruptly. 
                &quot;Don't fucking do that! I'm not a dyke, you know!&quot;<p>
                &quot;'Dyke'?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Lesbian. You know. A woman who has sex with another woman.&quot;<p>
                &quot;That's weird. I don't understand why not. Is it some religious 
                reason or something?&quot;<p>
                Sharon sighed. Everything was weird here. Wasn't there anyone 
                who understood normal sex? Mind you, she enjoyed cock for the 
                first time properly since Throb (dismissing her stay at the army 
                camp as being something wholly unsavoury and best forgotten). 
                The men in Sodom were so much easier to pick up, and so much more 
                ready to pick you up than back home. All it did was for a man 
                to like the look of you, and there you were, in the back room, 
                in the corridor, anywhere, with people walking by, with this cock 
                fucking you, sometimes with the extra embellishments of massive 
                studs through the glans. And the men weren't too bad at it, either. 
                But they were always a bit eager to use the back entrance. It 
                was as if the front entrance just wasn't good enough. Thankfully 
                for Sharon she didn't really mind which entrance was used, though 
                after a few fucks up the arse she was beginning to feel her cunt 
                was relatively neglected.<p>
                She also found that this weird Sodomite religion was present throughout 
                the working day. On about three occasions a day, for about fifteen 
                minutes or so, a high percentage of the office staff disappeared 
                together for their religious observations. Sacrifice and her slave, 
                and also Suffering, left Sharon and Sweetness together with Humility 
                in their corner of the office. Like Faith, Humility had not chosen 
                to be baptised in the faith although she was not unsympathetic.<p>
                &quot;I just don't enjoy all that whipping, beating and buggery,&quot; 
                she admitted to Sharon. &quot;If only there were other ways of 
                demonstrating your faith which didn't hurt quite so much. And 
                I just don't want to lose my finger. It's not done me any harm. 
                In fact, I'm quite fond of it.&quot; She held up her hand and 
                flexed her third finger with a sigh.<p>
                When the others returned, they seemed flushed with exertion and 
                sweat, often with traces of blood rising from welts on their back 
                and buttocks, and sometimes with a small trickle of blood down 
                their thighs. Sacrifice's slave seemed to be especially badly 
                treated, sometimes smelling of piss, and frequently with cuts 
                on his face and with a bright red shine to his buttocks. He never 
                seemed at all upset by it though. His grin was often in direct 
                proportion to the amount of pain he must have sustained: the more 
                he was punished, the more he appeared to enjoy it. In fact, no 
                humiliation seemed too much for him, often licking the soles of 
                Sacrifice's feet and on at least one occasion, licking out dried 
                shit from between her saggy bony arse cheeks.<p>
                Still, whatever! thought Sharon. She was happy with the odd corridor 
                fuck, and sometimes she persuaded men to come back with her to 
                Faith's flat where she would allow herself to be fucked back and 
                front for as long as it took, buying off Faith's acquiescence 
                with the gift of Sweetness' always eager body. The cries of passion 
                and ecstasy that erupted from Faith's bed were joined by Sharon's 
                own guttural irruptions as chains clashed with chains, rings clanked 
                against rings, bare hairless flesh slid over flesh. And that all 
                important cock thrusting in and out of her cunt. And sometimes 
                in her arse. And sometimes, although Sharon was less keen herself, 
                she'd be persuaded to strap on a dildo and push that in and out 
                of the man's arse as he gasped and grunted from the pleasure he 
                seemed to get as it rubbed against his prostrate gland.<p>
                Sharon was never sure how happy Sweetness was. It was clear that 
                she was quite happy. At least, happier than she'd ever been before 
                in their acquaintance. Life in Sodom seemed to agree with her, 
                and she lent herself quite readily to her role as a slave, even 
                though Sharon never allowed her to enjoy with her the sexual pleasures 
                she allowed her to have with anyone else. Sharon had no objection 
                to other people making love to Sweetness: favours the gratitude 
                for which were strangely enough expressed to her rather than to 
                Sweetness who was rarely thanked. It made life with Faith much 
                easier than it might be. She often commented on Sharon's generosity. 
                She even surmised that Sharon's reluctance to have sex with her 
                slave was a subtle kind of humiliation she was meting on her, 
                which Sharon chose not to deny, although it was a rather novel 
                notion to her.<p>
                It also made her popular with her work colleagues, even though 
                it was obvious that they had no idea why it was that someone who 
                had so quickly gained a reputation for her easy promiscuity, which 
                was seen as a great virtue, should be so fastidious as to the 
                gender of who she had sex with when she was otherwise so indiscriminate. 
                Humility was particularly uncomfortable with Sharon's rejections 
                of her advances, but accepted sex with Sweetness as some kind 
                of compensation. Sometimes, Sharon wondered how it was that any 
                work was ever done in a day with so much sex in the office. But 
                then she reflected that it was probably all this fucking which 
                lowered productivity and in turn ensured that there was plenty 
                of work to go round, and this was why Sodom managed to achieve 
                full employment. <p>
                However, philosophical thoughts like this rarely crossed her mind 
                as she lay in bed with whatever man she'd picked up and took his 
                prick in her mouth and sucked it clean of come. And such pricks! 
                Almost all of them had at least one stud in it, to hold the chains 
                in place, and sometimes they were a festering mass of metal. She 
                soon came to associate the sharp tinny taste of steel with the 
                pleasures of sex, to be taken as an aperitif before being fucked 
                by metal and cock, or to be taken as dessert when her cunt was 
                sore and her arse was bleeding. Whatever else could be said about 
                Sodom, the Sodomites certainly knew how to fuck!</p>
