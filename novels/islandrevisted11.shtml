                As we sat side-by-side upon a huge boulder in the forest, Torrie 
                and I had been thoroughly immersed in a deep-rooted and rather 
                enlightening discussion over the past half-hour. We were past 
                the point of talking about Trish, and Torrie's feelings about 
                her. I had somehow convinced the gorgeous blonde to take back 
                those nasty things she had said about Trish, and later apologize 
                to Lindsay for her outburst.<p>
                &quot;I'm not the happiest person in the world, you know,&quot; 
                Torrie said to me with a frown, while shaking her head. &quot;I 
                have this great body, you know, and both guys and girls from all 
                walks of life continually lust after me. It's not very hard for 
                me to find a date.&quot; She paused and added, &quot;But what 
                is hard for me is finding someone who cares about me.&quot;<p>
                I too, frowned at those words. Earlier in my life, I had went 
                through a very similar problem - especially after my ex-fiancee, 
                Victoria, dumped me. Of course, I went into great detail about 
                that stage of my life in chapter eight. So, I won't re-hash it 
                here, again.<p>
                &quot;All my life, I've been the dumb blonde,&quot; Torrie went 
                on. &quot;People look at me and think I'm not smart enough, I'm 
                not bright enough. I'm not good enough to settle down with, in 
                a true relationship. My sole reason for living is to have sex. 
                People have treated me that way my entire life.&quot;<p>
                Those words really hit home for me. There have been many times, 
                especially during the summer, when I looked at Torrie and thought 
                of her as being a little ditzy. Not dumb, but ditzy - like she 
                had no organization, or direction, in life. I didn't like to look 
                at anyone in such a light... but with Torrie, it was very easy 
                to do. She brought it upon herself.<p>
                I wasn't about to lie or sugar-coat anything for Torrie. She was 
                pouring her heart out, and at least deserved honest replies and 
                answers from me. &quot;Why don't you let others see you for who 
                you really are, then?&quot; I said to her. &quot;Lindsay had no 
                idea that your feelings for her were so strong until you told 
                her a few hours ago. You kept all those feelings for her bottled 
                up inside, for six months. What you should have done was tell 
                Lindsay how you felt a long time ago.&quot;<p>
                &quot;How could I?&quot; Torrie countered. &quot;Trish was all 
                over Lindsay from the moment they first met each other, at the 
                airport in Los Angeles, just before we came to the island the 
                first time. They were together all summer long, until the very 
                end. I could barely get a word in with Lindsay.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Now, a few months later, was I supposed to profess my love 
                for Lindsay the first day I returned to the island? I would have 
                liked to, but I didn't want to come across as too strong or too 
                pushy. I wanted to give Lindsay a chance to develop her feelings 
                for me - if there were any. All was going great, too, until I 
                heard Trish was coming back. It was as if Lindsay completely forgot 
                about me, because her whole mind and universe was once again centered 
                upon Trish. I don't think that was right, or fair.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You and Lindsay spent a lot of time together during the 
                summer,&quot; I said to her. &quot;Don't tell me that you couldn't 
                get a word in with her. That's a lie, Torrie.&quot;<p>
                &quot;An exaggeration,&quot; she corrected me. &quot;But still, 
                not much of one. If Trish wasn't with us when Lindsay and I were 
                together, it seemed as though the specter of her was very close-by... 
                watching our every move. I always felt very grounded whenever 
                I was with Lindsay. Do the wrong thing, or say the wrong thing 
                - and Trish would strike down upon me... with vengeance. It's 
                not good to feel that way.&quot;<p>
                Those were some pretty unique thoughts on Torrie's part, but I 
                understood them perfectly.<p>
                &quot;Lindsay and Trish were lovers,&quot; I said to her, &quot;but 
                in the context of this island. This island is very unique because 
                I have promoted such a sharing lifestyle. If you came across Lindsay 
                and Trish in your normal life, Torrie, you would have probably 
                never even had a chance to get close to Lindsay. You wouldn't 
                have even TOUCHED her. Trish may be a possessive type, but she 
                was into the idea of sharing on the island - as all of you girls 
                are.&quot; I paused and added, &quot;You cannot blame Trish for 
                watching over Lindsay. They were so much in love together, and 
                still are.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I know,&quot; Torrie said with a frown. &quot;But I love 
                Lindsay TOO. I just wish she felt the same about way me.&quot;<p>
                I reached out and grasped Torrie's hand with my own. I felt extremely 
                sorry for her. But at the same time, she had to understand the 
                simple fact that Lindsay's feelings were much stronger for Trish 
                than they were for her.<p>
                &quot;I know what you are going through, dear,&quot; were my words 
                for Torrie. &quot;I went through the same thing several years 
                ago with Victoria, a former fiancee of mine. She left me for someone 
                else, and it took me a long time to get over the extreme pain 
                and anguish. I always wondered why she loved the person she left 
                me for, more than she did me.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yeah, I heard a bit about that,&quot; Torrie said. &quot;But 
                for me, it's just not about Lindsay and Trish. I go back to what 
                I said earlier - I'm not a very happy person. I really never have 
                been. It's even worse now, because I am a damn pornstar. I don't 
                WANT to be a pornstar.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Then why are you?&quot; I asked her.<p>
                &quot;Because Amy talked me into it,&quot; she replied in a squealy<p>
                voice. &quot;Well... I let her talk me into it. It didn't take 
                me a long time to realize, after we started doing movies, that 
                Amy didn't care about me. All she wanted from me was two things. 
                Number one, sex. Number two, someone to help her break into the 
                porn industry with. Other than that, Amy had no real use for me. 
                I DID care about her, for awhile.&quot;<p>
                I nodded my head at her. &quot;So when you say that you and Amy 
                are girlfriend and girlfriend, it's really not the case? Your 
                relationship with her is not as strong as you told me it was - 
                last month, over the telephone?&quot;<p>
                Torrie shook her head while trying to hold back her tears before 
                saying, &quot;I just wanted you to think that I was doing good 
                in life, for a change. I told you that I was unsure about porn, 
                but that Amy and I were happy together. It was rare when I saw 
                Amy. She made a lot more movies than I did, she went to various 
                strip clubs and performed, made personal appearances everywhere. 
                I never got into any of those extra things. When I did see Amy, 
                all she wanted to do was fuck. I was nothing more than an object 
                to her - and that hurt.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Amy is a different breed,&quot; I said to Torrie. &quot;She 
                is very different than most people. Still, though... I don't understand 
                why it is that I seem to be the only one who has nice things to 
                say about her - as a person. Trish hated her for what she tried 
                to do to Lindsay during the summer. Lindsay eventually saw through 
                Amy as well. Now, you speak of her in a very negative way. Why 
                am I the only one who has anything good to say about Amy?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Oh, that's easy,&quot; Torrie commented. &quot;You're the 
                only person - maybe in the whole world - that Amy actually does 
                care about.&quot; My eyes went wide at those words. &quot;Ever 
                since we left here a few months ago, Amy talked about you every 
                single day, Jeremy. She missed you so much.&quot; Torrie paused 
                before adding, &quot;That's why you can look at her, and like 
                her as a person... because she treats YOU like a person. Maybe 
                not all the time, but much more than anyone else she knows.&quot;<p>
                Torrie was right. She had that figured out, while I had long wondered 
                why others looked at Amy differently than me. What Torrie just 
                said to me made absolute, perfect sense.<p>
                Why couldn't I have figured that out myself?<p>
                Torrie obviously wasn't as dumb as she thought she was...<p>
                &quot;Getting into porn was a mistake,&quot; the blonde continued. 
                &quot;It just made my family and friends in California look at 
                me in an even lower light than before. I lost most of my friends, 
                to tell you the truth. They wanted nothing to do with me once 
                I started making X-rated movies with Amy.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You have friends here on the island,&quot; I said, clutching 
                her hand a bit tighter. &quot;Lindsay told me that you told her 
                without the chance of getting close to her, you should have just 
                stayed in California.&quot; I paused and continued, &quot;Is that 
                what you really want, Torrie? If you lost your friends because 
                of porn, and your family is down on you, why would you rather 
                be back in California... instead of here?&quot;<p>
                Torrie's eyes narrowed as she appeared lost in thought.<p>
                &quot;I care about you, sweetheart,&quot; were my follow-up words.<p>
                &quot;Pamela cares about you. And though you may not think it, 
                Lindsay cares about you, too.&quot; I paused before adding, &quot;Let 
                me say, Torrie, that Trish also cares about you. You and her had 
                a good time together during the summer... despite your jealousy 
                for her. And in due time, I'm sure that Devon, Cassidy and Stephanie 
                will care about you, as well.&quot;<p>
                Torrie still appeared lost in thought...<p>
                &quot;This is my island, dear,&quot; I said to her, &quot;and 
                you're<p>
                always welcome on it. You want people to care about you? We care 
                about you. Myself, Pamela, Lindsay, Trish. We all care about you.&quot; 
                I wanted to add Amy to that mix, but I didn't think Torrie would 
                like to hear her name.<p>
                &quot;Why do YOU care about me?&quot; the 26-year-old asked. &quot;You 
                brought all of us girls here so we could have sex with you, and 
                each other. How are you different, Jeremy, than all of the other 
                guys I have known throughout my entire life?&quot;<p>
                That was a good question - and one I wasn't prepared for.<p>
                After a few seconds, I finally managed to get out, &quot;I brought 
                you and the others here to promote togetherness. And while I enjoy 
                the sex, it's not the most important thing on my mind. I want 
                to see you girls happy. I don't want to see you all depressed 
                and sad, or angry at each other. Why? Because I care about you. 
                I care about ALL of you.&quot; I paused and added, &quot;You're 
                all like a flock of angels to me.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I'm not sure that answered my question,&quot; Torrie returned 
                in a soft voice. &quot;But maybe my question was a bit harsh to 
                begin with. I know you care about all of us, Jeremy.&quot; She 
                hesitated before saying, &quot;I care about you, too.&quot;<p>
                I smiled at her. &quot;Thank you, dear.&quot; I offered her a 
                warm embrace, which eventually broke off before we exchanged knowing 
                smiles. Then, a negative thought hit me. &quot;You're not mad 
                at Amy now... are you?&quot;<p>
                Torrie shook her head and replied, &quot;No, I'm not mad at her. 
                Amy is just Amy. She is who she is. Besides...&quot; Her voice 
                trailed off for a moment before she added, &quot;Amy gives GREAT 
                tongue. That is one part of her I'm addicted to.&quot;<p>
                My eyebrows went skyward at those words, before I settled down 
                and offered Torrie another smile. &quot;Oh. I see.&quot;<p>
                Torrie giggled at my reaction. &quot;I am through with porn, though. 
                I've made up my mind on that. It was a mistake in the first place, 
                though I'm glad to say it didn't destroy me. Of course, I wasn't 
                in it for all that long...&quot;<p>
                &quot;Will you talk to me some more, dear?&quot; I said to her. 
                &quot;Not necessarily right now, but throughout the winter? I 
                want to get to know you a lot more. I made a horrible mistake 
                in the summer-time. I was so pre-occupied with Amy, Pamela, Lindsay 
                and Trish, that I never really got to know you or Lisa all that 
                well. I'd like to correct that this winter. I don't want to shut 
                you or any of the other new girls - Stephanie, Devon and Cassidy 
                - out.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Of course I'll talk to you,&quot; Torrie grinned. &quot;During 
                the times we actually have talked, I've found you so easy to be 
                around. It's like I can tell you anything, Jeremy. You're always 
                so easy-going, and friendly.&quot;<p>
                I reached out and tapped her nose with my fingertip, which made 
                her both giggle and smile. &quot;Thank you, sweetie. I want to 
                get to know you this winter. Will you promise me one thing?&quot; 
                She nodded her head, and I continued, &quot;Since you find me 
                so easy to talk to... tell me any problems you have. I'm not sure 
                I have a solution to your feelings about Lindsay, but I'll do 
                whatever I can to help. I hope you know that. Promise you'll talk 
                to me if you have any problems - provided, of course, you feel 
                like sharing them.&quot;<p>
                Torrie nodded her head and answered, &quot;Yes, I promise.&quot; 
                She paused and added, &quot;I'll just do my best to be happy for 
                Lindsay and Trish. They... they really are a dynamite couple. 
                I do have to admit that.&quot;<p>
                I smiled at her and said, &quot;It took me 27 years of my life 
                to find the right woman for me - Pamela. I went through a lot 
                of heartache along the way... but now, I feel as though it was 
                all worth it. As long as I have Pamela, it was.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You and her were made for each other,&quot; Torrie grinned.<p>
                &quot;The point being,&quot; I told her, &quot;is that it may 
                take you<p>
                some time to find who is really right for you. I hope it is one 
                of these girls on the island - perhaps Devon, Stephanie or Cassidy. 
                Do you have strong feelings for any of them?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I kinda like Devon,&quot; Torrie admitted. &quot;But it 
                seems that the only person she is interested in is you, Jeremy.&quot;<p>
                I gulped my throat at those words, knowing that Pamela (as well 
                as Lindsay) were eavesdropping on this discussion from the comfort 
                of my voyeur room. I had yet to talk to Pamela about Devon, and 
                those things she had said about us to Cassidy the other night.<p>
                &quot;All I know is that I want Jeremy,&quot; was what Devon had 
                said. &quot;I'll go through Pamela to get him, if I have to.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Stephanie is nice, too,&quot; Torrie added. &quot;Cassidy? 
                I don't know about her. She seems a little snobbish. She seems 
                like the type of person who can't be trusted.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Why do you say that?&quot; I asked, curious.<p>
                &quot;I don't know,&quot; the blonde replied. &quot;It's just 
                a feeling<p>
                I have about her.&quot; She paused and added, &quot;But as I said, 
                I will be happy for Lindsay and Trish. I still love Lindsay, and 
                want her very much. But, I guess her and Trish really do belong 
                together. There is obviously nothing I can do to change that. 
                I wish I had a relationship that strong...&quot;<p>
                &quot;You will, Torrie,&quot; I promised her. &quot;You will. 
                It may take some time, but your day will come. Trust me on that.&quot;<p>
                The blonde offered me a positive smile in response.</p>
              <p> * * *<p>
                <p>
                Squirming around like a fish out of water, Lindsay stood before 
                me with both hands clasped together at her waist as she looked 
                at me with a besought expression. &quot;Jeremy,&quot; the little 
                blonde whined, &quot;please, please, please! PLEASE... please 
                take me to the airport so I can see Trish when she gets off her 
                plane. I can't wait to see her. Please!&quot;<p>
                It was the day following my long talk with Torrie, and things 
                along that front seemed to have settled down. That knowledge, 
                as you may imagine, made me feel very good. The past 24 hours 
                had been rather trying, but it seems as though we weathered the 
                storm and made it through fairly unscathed.<p>
                In just a few hours, Trish's flight from Los Angeles was due to 
                land at the airport on the mainland. As a result, Lindsay had 
                naturally been overly hyper and excited all day long. The 19-year-old 
                was not exaggerating when she said that she could not wait to 
                see Trish.<p>
                Lindsay wanted nothing more than to be re-united with her long-lost 
                girlfriend - and as quickly as possible. Lindsay had been pestering 
                me for the past hour or two, wanting me to take her to the mainland 
                (via the big boat) so we could meet up with Trish as she stepped 
                off of her flight.<p>
                On the other hand, I had already made plans for Trish to be escorted 
                here to the island. Ian, a friend of mine who owned a helicopter, 
                was paid good money to see that Trish made it from the airport 
                to the island all safe and sound. Plus, I really did not feel 
                like taking the big boat to the mainland tonight. Tired, I just 
                wanted to stay here.<p>
                However, Lindsay's whines and pleas for me to see things her way 
                were quite powerful - and convincing.<p>
                &quot;Come on, Jeremy,&quot; she continued, still begging me. 
                &quot;I can't wait to see Trish! Please take me to the airport. 
                I want to see her so bad! I don't want to wait any longer than 
                I have to. Please, please, please... PLEASE!&quot;<p>
                &quot;Oh... okay, sweetheart,&quot; I told her, finally giving 
                in. The 19-year-old's response was an excited squeal, followed 
                by a series of bunny-rabbit jumps and hops. Really now... was 
                there any possible way that I could turn Lindsay down?<p>
                &quot;Thank you, Jeremy!&quot; Lindsay exclaimed, reaching out 
                and grabbing onto my wrists with her hands. More lively and hyper 
                than I had ever seen her before, Lindsay continued jumping and 
                hopping about. &quot;Thank you SO much!&quot;<p>
                &quot;This Trish girl must be someone very special,&quot; Stephanie 
                observed, as she sat at the common room table along with Amy, 
                Pamela, Torrie, Cassidy and Devon. All of them had been witness 
                to Lindsay's desperate pleas and happy squeals.<p>
                &quot;She IS someone very special,&quot; Pamela chimed in, looking 
                at Stephanie. &quot;Trish and Lindsay should have never split 
                apart in the first place. They definitely belong together.&quot;<p>
                Stephanie, along with Devon and Cassidy, had never met Trish because, 
                of course, none of them were here in the summer. All three of 
                them were still new to the island.<p>
                &quot;Trish is about as nice and as caring as someone can possibly 
                be,&quot; Pamela remarked. &quot;I'm so happy that she is coming 
                back. I know how much her and Lindsay love each other. It about 
                broke my heart to see them split up.&quot;<p>
                &quot;But now we're gonna be back together!&quot; Lindsay exclaimed 
                with glee, as she stepped forward and placed her arms around my 
                lower back for a tight embrace. &quot;And I can't wait!&quot;<p>
                &quot;You girls will like her, too,&quot; Pamela said to the three 
                newcomers. &quot;Trust me on that.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I'm sure we'll all like her,&quot; Devon said. &quot;I mean... 
                if sweet, 'lil Lindsay can fall head over heels for Trish, then 
                she just HAS to be someone special and unique.&quot; Devon gave 
                Lindsay a wicked glance and wryly asked, &quot;Does Trish eat 
                a good pussy, sweetheart?&quot;<p>
                Stephanie and Cassidy offered bulging eyes to Devon's provocative 
                question, while Lindsay sneered and answered, &quot;Oh yes... 
                she's one of the best.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Then I'll definitely have to meet her,&quot; Devon nodded.<p>
                On that note, I decided it was time for a change-of-pace.<p>
                The last thing I wanted right now was to get Devon going...<p>
                I looked down at Lindsay and smiled at her. &quot;Why don't you 
                go and get ready, princess? Wear something warm too, because the 
                winds out on the ocean can get pretty cold after night-fall. We're 
                gonna be open to them on the boat.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Thank you,&quot; Lindsay reiterated, leaning upwards and 
                planting her lips upon mine for a gentle kiss. &quot;Thank you 
                SO MUCH, Jeremy. I don't know if I can ever re-pay you for this, 
                but I'll try.&quot; She wiggled out of my arms and then shuffled 
                off to her room, in order to change her clothing.<p>
                &quot;I'll stay here on the island with everyone else,&quot; Pamela 
                told me. She looked at the other ladies and offered me a wicked 
                grin. &quot;I'm sure we'll all find SOMETHING to do... while you 
                and Lindsay are out picking up Trish.&quot;<p>
                I'd bet that &quot;something&quot; will include lips and tongues...</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>It was 5:30pm when Lindsay and I, in the 62-foot-long catamaran 
                boat, shoved off from the island's harbor. The trip to the mainland 
                would take an hour, and the subsequent bus-ride to the airport 
                would span about 15 or 20 minutes. Trish's plane was set to arrive 
                at 7:00pm, so there wouldn't be much time for either Lindsay or 
                myself to spare.<p>
                During the cruise to the mainland, Lindsay was unusually quiet. 
                I figured that she was thinking about Trish, and the many things 
                both of them could do together to catch up with each other. I 
                just felt extremely happy for her and Trish.<p>
                Just about the only thing which Lindsay did say to me was when 
                she asked if this was a dream.<p>
                &quot;No, it's not,&quot; I told her. &quot;You're going to meet 
                up with Trish, and be back together with her, in a short time.&quot;<p>
                Lindsay's only reply for that was a charming smile.<p>
                It was rather obvious that Torrie, and the many troubles from 
                yesterday, were the furthest thing from Lindsay's mind. She was 
                concentrating on Trish, and that made me very happy.<p>
                It was also good to see that the 19-year-old had taken my advice. 
                Instead of a tank-top and a pair of shorts - her standard choice 
                of attire while on the island - Lindsay had dressed a bit warmer. 
                While out in the open ocean like this, the wind can swirl and 
                be quite chilly in this area.<p>
                Lindsay wore a pair of faded denim jeans which hugged and clutched 
                her little, sweet hips in a most wondrous manner. The shape and 
                contours of her ass - the thing which I LOVED to fuck - was on 
                full, luscious display.<p>
                In addition, the blonde wore a windbreaker jacket, along with 
                a light blue sweater underneath. It was so unusual for me to see 
                either her or Pamela in regular, everyday clothing. I really had 
                to fight the urge to stop the boat right there, and drill sweet, 
                little Lindsay with my cock. She, much like Pamela, looked extremely 
                sexy to me in &quot;regular&quot; clothes.<p>
                The highlight of the trip to the mainland, at least for me, was 
                when I allowed Lindsay to steer the boat. I stood directly behind 
                her and kept my body close to hers, while planting delicate angel 
                kisses upon her neck and shoulders. Giggling and squirming about 
                slightly, Lindsay enjoyed that.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>Perhaps this should not come as a surprise, but Trish's flight 
                from Los Angeles was a bit late. It touched down on the runway 
                at 7:25pm, and did not taxi up to the terminal gate until a good 
                20 minutes later.<p>
                As could be expected, Lindsay was on pins and needles as passengers 
                began filing out of the aircraft. In the middle of the massive 
                throng of travelers was a single blonde and beautiful woman, who 
                wore an eye-popping business style outfit consisting of a blouse, 
                jacket and knee-length skirt.<p>
                &quot;TRISH!&quot; Lindsay exclaimed, before she scampered over 
                to her long-lost girlfriend and embraced her tightly.<p>
                Even in such a public place like an airport, Lindsay had no problem 
                or hesitation as she hugged Trish as hard as she could. A few 
                people stared at them as they went by, but Lindsay did not seem 
                to care - or even notice.<p>
                Neither did Trish, for that matter.<p>
                I made my way over to the happy couple and offered Trish a smile 
                as she noticed me for the first time. She broke off her embrace 
                with Lindsay and grinned at me, then wrapped her arms around me 
                for my own hug. &quot;Thank you, Jeremy,&quot; she said to me, 
                her arms tightening around my body. &quot;Thank you for your persistence, 
                in trying to get me to come back here.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You're very welcome, Miss Trish,&quot; I told her, grinning.<p>
                A moment later, the embrace ended and Trish looked at<p>
                both Lindsay and me. &quot;I thought that guy - Ian? - I thought 
                he was going to pick me up.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I couldn't wait to see you,&quot; Lindsay sneered, reaching 
                out and grasping Trish's hands. &quot;I convinced Jeremy to bring 
                me here to the airport so I could see you get off the airplane. 
                We came here on his boat.&quot; Lindsay hugged Trish again, saying, 
                &quot;I'm so happy you decided to come back.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I had to call Ian and tell him not to pick you up,&quot; 
                I told Trish. &quot;Of course, though, he still wanted his money.&quot;<p>
                Trish offered a momentary frown and remarked, &quot;I'm so tired. 
                Seems like I've been flying forever.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Awww... you poor thing,&quot; Lindsay said, looking deep 
                into her girlfriend's eyes. &quot;Did you have a good flight, 
                though?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yeah,&quot; Trish nodded. &quot;I'm just tired. Toronto 
                to Chicago to Los Angeles to here.&quot; She offered a grin and 
                added, &quot;I'm going to get a lot of sleep tonight.&quot;<p>
                &quot;We'll get your stuff from baggage claim, then get back on 
                the bus and go to the boat,&quot; I said to Trish. &quot;I'll 
                get you back to the island as soon as I can, dear. Seems like 
                you want to go to sleep... and fast.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Can we stop and get something to eat here at the airport 
                first?&quot; Lindsay asked. &quot;I know there is food on the 
                boat, but I'd like to sit down here and eat. Also... I wanted 
                to check out the gift shoppe before we left.&quot; She looked 
                at Trish and added, &quot;If all of that is okay with you?&quot;<p>
                The Canadian offered a gracious smile and traced her hand along 
                Lindsay's face. &quot;Of course it's okay with me. Let's get something 
                to eat, and let's check out the gift shoppe. Anything you want 
                to do, baby.&quot;<p>
                Lindsay and Trish were deep into conversation with each other 
                as I later tagged along behind them with suitcases in tow. Still 
                not caring what others thought about them, the two ladies stayed 
                close and even held hands as they giggled and snickered together 
                about all sorts of things.<p>
                After a stop at the salad bar and sit-down dining area, the three 
                of us paid a visit to the gift shoppe. I wound up buying Lindsay 
                a Christmas wreath, while Trish purchased a whole mess of post-cards. 
                She was going to send them to her friends and family members in 
                Canada.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>&quot;I've always been fascinated by the stars,&quot; I heard 
                Lindsay say, as she and Trish sat atop the sun-deck upon the big 
                boat. We were en route for the island, and the sun had already 
                gone down. Without a cloud in sight, the whole sky was decorated 
                with beautiful stars and constellations.<p>
                &quot;When I was little,&quot; Lindsay continued, &quot;I would 
                go out at night and look up at the stars. I always wondered if 
                there were other people living on them. Aliens, you know.&quot;<p>
                With the ocean waters unusually calm and still tonight, I could 
                plainly hear Lindsay and Trish as they talked with each other. 
                I would love to be up on the sun-deck with them, of course, but 
                someone needed to steer the boat.<p>
                &quot;I used to do the same thing,&quot; Trish said. &quot;My 
                dad would always point out the stars and tell me their names. 
                He knew a lot about them, and constellations.&quot; She paused 
                and said, &quot;Looking at the stars is so peaceful and relaxing.&quot;<p>
                My eyes grew big as I heard the two ladies share a kiss. Along 
                with their lips grinding together and the unmistakable suction 
                and gentle moaning sounds, I knew they were kissing.<p>
                &quot;Hmmmmm,&quot; Lindsay sighed seconds later. &quot;Wonderful.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Would either of you ladies like me to get you a<p>
                telescope?&quot; I said to them, calling out. &quot;I didn't know 
                that you two had an interest in the stars.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I'd love that,&quot; Trish replied.<p>
                &quot;Yeah,&quot; Lindsay added. &quot;A telescope would be cool.&quot;<p>
                I smiled while steering the catamaran. &quot;Then consider it<p>
                done. It will be on the next supply boat.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You're not spying on us... are you, Jeremy?&quot; Lindsay 
                giggled in a playful tone.<p>
                &quot;I can't help it!&quot; I exclaimed in reply. &quot;The ocean 
                is so quiet tonight, there's no waves. I hear everything.&quot;<p>
                &quot;That's okay,&quot; Lindsay sneered. &quot;We're all good 
                friends anyway, you know.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Trish?&quot; I called out. &quot;Can I ask you something?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Sure,&quot; the Canadian replied.<p>
                &quot;What happened to your girlfriend... Stacy?&quot; I asked 
                her.<p>
                &quot;I was curious about that. From what you told me, you two 
                were pretty happy and serious together.&quot;<p>
                &quot;We were...&quot; Trish said after a long pause. &quot;But 
                things change. Stacy and I broke up just last week.&quot; She 
                paused once more before adding, &quot;I'm glad we did, though. 
                Now, I'm back with Lindsay.&quot; My cock began to twitch as I 
                listened to them trade yet another blissful kiss.<p>
                &quot;You're not leaving me again,&quot; Lindsay said firmly.<p>
                &quot;Don't worry,&quot; Trish countered. &quot;I'm not going 
                anywhere.&quot;<p>
                Again, I heard them kiss.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>Call it sweet torture if you want, but I had to listen to the 
                sounds of Lindsay and Trish giggle and kiss one another for the 
                entire trip back to the island. Normally I enjoyed such things, 
                of course, but I considered it somewhat similar to (sweet) torture 
                because I could not go up to the sundeck and join in on their 
                fun. I had to steer the boat. #%@&amp;!<p>
                When we finally reached the island, the time was 9:15pm. I gathered 
                Trish's many suitcases from the boat, and loaded them up onto 
                the Jeep. The whole time, Lindsay and Trish cuddled close together 
                in the front seat of the Jeep... holding hands and trading tender, 
                affectionate kisses.<p>
                I THINK they were happy to be back together... (!)<p>
                As I drove the Jeep up to the mansion, Lindsay told Trish that 
                her and Torrie had been room-mates on the island during the past 
                week. Trish was smiles at the mention of Torrie, and had nothing 
                but good things to say about the time they spent together during 
                the summer. For an instant, I feared that Lindsay would tell Trish 
                of the uproar which Torrie had caused yesterday. That would dampen 
                Trish's thoughts...<p>
                Instead, Lindsay told her that she and Torrie were not going to 
                be room-mates anymore. Lindsay would share the same suite with 
                Trish, while Torrie would move into the fourth guest room - with 
                Pamela. This had already been discussed (and agreed upon) earlier 
                today, Lindsay said.<p>
                &quot;Jeremy is going to have his rotation system set up once 
                again... just like the summer,&quot; Lindsay explained to Trish. 
                &quot;He will spend the night with a different girl every night, 
                on a rotating basis. Eight girls, eight different nights.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Sounds like you'll be a busy man,&quot; Trish grinned at 
                me.<p>
                &quot;I also had a talk with Pamela, earlier,&quot; Lindsay said,<p>
                looking at me. &quot;She was going to spend the night with you 
                tonight, Jeremy, but that all changed. Pamela moved into her new 
                room with Torrie, so they can be together tonight.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Oh?&quot; I said, my eyebrows raised. The image of Torrie 
                blasting my sweet wife with a strap-on dildo suddenly danced throughout 
                my mind. It was enough to give me a hard-on as I continued to 
                drive the Jeep toward the mansion.<p>
                Lindsay looked at Trish and said, &quot;If you don't mind, honey, 
                you and I can spend the night with Jeremy.&quot; My eyes nearly 
                exploded at those words, while Trish smiled lustily. &quot;I'm 
                not letting you out of my sight,&quot; Lindsay said to Trish before 
                looking at me and adding, &quot;And you're the main reason why 
                the two of us are back together.&quot;<p>
                &quot;His persistence finally paid off,&quot; Trish grinned. &quot;All 
                those e-mail messages he sent... I expected to get one every day. 
                Oh Trish, get back with Lindsay. You and her belong together. 
                It's a crime that you two are apart... He finally got me to come 
                back. Finally!&quot;<p>
                &quot;Would you like to spend the night with me and Jeremy?&quot; 
                Lindsay asked her girlfriend. &quot;I have many things I want 
                to do to your body, baby.&quot; Lindsay smiled while glancing 
                my way, before saying, &quot;And we have to re-pay Jeremy for, 
                as you put it... his persistence.&quot;<p>
                Trish grinned and replied, &quot;I'd love to spend the night snuggled 
                between you and Jeremy, sweetheart.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Excellent,&quot; Lindsay smirked.<p>
                Now, my hard-on was raging... and about to explode.<p>
                Trish's eyes glared for a quick moment as she looked at Lindsay. 
                &quot;Hey there,&quot; she said to her, &quot;WHAT in the world 
                were you doing in a PORN MOVIE on Amy's website? You know how 
                much I was against that thought in the summer-time.&quot;<p>
                &quot;It really wasn't a porn movie,&quot; Lindsay replied, trying 
                to defend herself. &quot;It was just a little webcast for the 
                Internet. I had a lot of fun doing it.&quot;<p>
                Trish paused before saying, &quot;I don't know if you have visited 
                Amy's public message board on her website or not, Lindsay, but 
                everyone there agrees that they want to see more of you. This 
                one guy even said that you have to be in the next... cheerleader 
                gang-bang movie. He said you should be the main star of it.&quot;<p>
                Lindsay giggled at those words. &quot;I have no intention of getting 
                into real porn, though I do plan on doing a few more webcasts 
                with Amy. Is that okay with you, Trish?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I guess the webcasts are okay,&quot; the Canadian returned. 
                &quot;I still don't like the idea of you degrading yourself like 
                that... but on the other hand, if you hadn't done that, I wouldn't 
                be here right now. Just seeing you live and in living color - 
                that's what convinced me to come back.&quot;</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>My cock was still hard and throbbing as I somehow managed to 
                drag Trish's many suitcases through the mansion all at once. I 
                took them to the guest corridor, and then the room that Lindsay 
                and Trish would share together. Perhaps, I thought to myself, 
                this room would be their home... for the rest of their lives. 
                It sure was an intriguing thought.<p>
                &quot;Where are we going to be tonight?&quot; Trish asked, looking 
                around the spacious room. &quot;Here, or in Jeremy's suite?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Jeremy's suite,&quot; Lindsay replied, without hesitation.<p>
                &quot;The bed in it is so big, and comfortable.&quot;<p>
                Trish smirked and said, &quot;Yes, I remember that now. His bed 
                fit eight people, rather easily, for those seven-on-one gang-bangs 
                we had during the summer.&quot; My cock bristled at the mere reminder. 
                &quot;We can leave my suitcases here for now. They're not going 
                anywhere, and I can unpack them tomorrow.&quot;<p>
                Trish then turned her attention upon Lindsay by wrapping both 
                arms around her slender, petite body. She offered her young lover 
                a tongue-filled kiss before saying, &quot;Let's get up to Jeremy's 
                room now. I don't know how much longer I can control myself around 
                you, babydoll.&quot;<p>
                Lindsay giggled at those words as she and Trish hooked their arms 
                together, before turning and beginning the walk toward my personal 
                suite. They were very focused upon one another - and rightfully 
                so - but had forget about someone.<p>
                &quot;Hey! Wait for me!&quot; I called out, moving forward and 
                following the pair of love-birds in close tow.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>One second hadn't passed after the three of us stepped foot into 
                my personal suite before Lindsay and Trish were all over each 
                other - like a wet blanket. The long and languid boat-ride had 
                been their warm-up period, while the short time in the Jeep served 
                as foreplay. Now, in my personal suite - the blonde-on-blonde 
                feast had begun.<p>
                I stood in the background and watched with interested eyes as 
                Lindsay and Trish nearly annihilated each others' mouths with 
                a flaming, passion-filled kiss. Trish had both hands on Lindsay's 
                tender ass, squeezing it roughly, while the younger blonde's hands 
                were full with Trish's breasts.<p>
                The pair of ladies groped and prodded each other in an intensive 
                manner, their clothing flying off in the process. Lindsay's jeans 
                were yanked downward, and Trish's business jacket and white blouse 
                were whisked away in a heartbeat. Next came Trish's bra, and then 
                her knee-length skirt. An instant later, Lindsay's windbreaker 
                jacket was discarded, as well as the thin sweater she wore underneath.<p>
                &quot;OH YES,&quot; Trish moaned against the searing kiss, as 
                she had been reduced to nothing but a G-string and high-heels. 
                Lindsay, on the other hand, only had on her bra and panties.<p>
                The two ladies pressed their bodies close together and shuddered 
                in absolute lust as they took things to the bed. Trish broke the 
                kiss, then grabbed ahold of Lindsay and tossed her down hard upon 
                the big, comfortable mattress.<p>
                &quot;I've often fantasized about this moment,&quot; Trish purred, 
                tracing a hand between her own thighs, as she glared down at Lindsay. 
                &quot;To be with you again, just like this...&quot;<p>
                &quot;I fantasized about it every night,&quot; Lindsay confessed.<p>
                &quot;I would finger myself to sleep, thinking of you, Trish...&quot;<p>
                &quot;Oh God...&quot; the Canadian sighed, sliding her G-string 
                down and stepping out of it. &quot;How did I ever leave you?&quot;<p>
                I already had my cock out and was busy stroking away as Trish 
                hopped onto the bed, on top of Lindsay, and began to assault her 
                with yet anothera heated kiss.<p>
                I was fairly certain that these two insatiable hellcats, as much 
                as they were into each other, were totally oblivious of my presence. 
                I had no problem with that - especially considering how this was 
                their reunion, of sorts.<p>
                I would get my chance here before too long...<p>
                With her arms pinned to the bed, Lindsay writhed and squirmed 
                about in sheer passion as Trish moved atop her, their mouths locked 
                together and tongues dancing. The duo broke their kiss and exchanged 
                giggles while rubbing their breasts together, before sharing yet 
                another hot lip-lock.<p>
                In the process, Trish literally ripped Lindsay's bra from her 
                chest. The teen's smallish-sized breasts popped out and were now 
                free, and Trish used the opportunity to rub her own (much longer) 
                breasts over top of them. With the nipple to nipple contact, both 
                ladies sighed and cooed in utter lust as their rather intensive, 
                fervid kiss continued.<p>
                Lindsay's arms were pinned above her head once again. But this 
                time, she struggled, and tried her best to break free. Trish would 
                not allow her, though, holding onto the little vixen's wrists 
                rather tightly. Lindsay squealed in frustration, which caused 
                Trish to suddenly break her hold.<p>
                An instant later, Lindsay used both arms to roll Trish beneath 
                her. With their positions now reversed, Lindsay pinned Trish's 
                arms to the mattress and absolutely lambasted her mouth with her 
                own.<p>
                These two were SO RIGHT for each other.<p>
                &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Trish moaned seconds after their latest kiss 
                had ended, as Lindsay's lips and tongue blazed a hot trail through 
                her vast, deepened cleavage. The young blonde paid oral homage 
                to that sensitive area for quite some time, but then shifted her 
                attention toward one of Trish's big, plump nipples. The Canadian 
                arched her neck and sighed in obvious arousal as Lindsay's skilled 
                mouth closed over top of her nipple, sucking and stimulating it 
                toward full alertness.<p>
                &quot;You like my breasts... don't you?&quot; Trish asked, cradling 
                Lindsay's head in her hands. &quot;Oh yesssss... you love them. 
                You... you've always loved to kiss, and lick them.&quot;<p>
                Lindsay's only response was a growl as she continued to devour 
                that one nipple.<p>
                &quot;I love all of you, babydoll,&quot; Trish breathed, her body 
                beginning to shudder about in greater arousal. &quot;Your face, 
                your lips... those pert, little breasts, and that wonderful, scrumptious 
                pussy. I love all of you. Every single inch!&quot;<p>
                I smiled at the sight while still frigging my cock. It was wonderful 
                to see such an erotic encounter unfold before my very eyes like 
                this. But what I enjoyed most of all was the simple fact that 
                Lindsay and Trish were back together. This was where each of them 
                rightfully belonged.<p>
                Lindsay seemed to be in a different universe as her lips and tongue 
                blazed another path throughout Trish's cleavage, before sliding 
                downward, toward her midriff and then her stomach. Trish's body 
                writhed in the sheer anticipation...<p>
                &quot;Are you going to fuck me with your tongue, baby?&quot; the 
                25-year-old asked. &quot;Oh yes, honey. FUCK me with your tongue! 
                Make me cum!&quot;<p>
                Lindsay must have taken those words to heart, because she soon 
                burrowed her face between Trish's widespread thighs and immediately 
                began to lick and swipe away at her lush pussy.<p>
                I continued pumping my shaft as Trish raised both knees into the 
                air, her high-heeled feet nestled squarely upon the bed. Trish 
                massaged her own breasts and squirmed about in mad passion as 
                Lindsay hungrily feasted upon her moist slit.<p>
                It wasn't too long before the 19-year-old decided to add a finger 
                to the mix, which did nothing but multiply Trish's arousal even 
                more. The busty blonde moaned as her entire body tensed in response 
                when Lindsay started to forcefully thrust a finger in-and-out 
                of that damp, needful pussy. All the while, she continued to lick 
                and swipe away at her folds.<p>
                &quot;OHHHHH YESSSSS...&quot; Trish managed to get out, her entire 
                body alive with undeniable emotion and desire. &quot;OHHHHH FUCK 
                YESSSSS... YES BABY, YES... THAT FEELS SO GOOD! SO GOOD!&quot;<p>
                Soon, Lindsay withdrew her finger and decided to focus all of 
                her energy into satisfying Trish with her lips and tongue. She 
                licked and slurped away at her, and paid close attention to her 
                clitoris. The little minx brushed her lower lip across it, which 
                caused Trish to moan in response.<p>
                Once Trish's body began to violently buck and shudder about beneath 
                her, Lindsay obviously knew that she had her lover close to an 
                orgasm. Thus, she decided to go all-out with her muff-diving frenzy.<p>
                As a result, Trish literally lost control of herself. She squeezed 
                her thighs around her girlfriend's head with a vice-tight grip, 
                while screaming out at the very top of her lungs. At the same 
                time, pussy-juice just seemed to ooze out from within her. Lindsay, 
                of course, was more than happy to lick and guzzle all of it up 
                with her tongue...<p>
                I moaned to myself while watching each of them rock and vibrate 
                together upon the bed, enjoying Trish's orgasm.<p>
                &quot;Oh God yes,&quot; Trish breathed as the heated sensations 
                inside of her soon reached their vortex, then began to settle 
                down. &quot;I really needed that, baby. I REALLY did...&quot;<p>
                As Lindsay withdrew her head from between Trish's thighs, she 
                grinned and moved upward, only to then offer her lover a full, 
                mouth-to-mouth kiss. The two ladies embraced and rolled around 
                several times upon the bed, lost in a sea of mad passion and sweet 
                love - directly solely at each other.<p>
                Their playful scuffling continued on the bed until Trish sat up, 
                and pulled Lindsay so that she was laying squarely across her 
                lap. My eyes went wide as I wondered to myself whether or not 
                Trish thought Lindsay deserved a spanking...<p>
                I was fairly certain that was the thing on her mind as Trish ripped 
                Lindsay's panties down, and off. The little blonde shuddered about, 
                finding herself in such a submissive position across her lover's 
                lap and knee. I'm sure she thought Trish was going to spank her, 
                too.<p>
                Lindsay absolutely LOVED being spanked.<p>
                However, Trish brought two fingers to her mouth and wet them thoroughly. 
                She smiled down at Lindsay and stroked her long-flowing blonde 
                hair and slender back with her free hand, while making sure those 
                two fingers were fully lubricated.<p>
                &quot;I know what I have to do, babydoll, to keep you happy,&quot; 
                Trish said, placing one of those fingers upon her lover's puckered 
                anus. She poked and prodded the air-tight hole, which sent my 
                eyebrows absolutely rocketing.<p>
                The 19-year-old sighed and flinched with desire as Trish inserted 
                her right index finger into Lindsay's sweet ass. She enjoyed gauging 
                her girlfriend's lusty reaction, then decided to add the second 
                finger to the mix. It was an incredibly tight fit, but Trish managed 
                to jam both fingers into Lindsay's rectum and move them about 
                somewhat.<p>
                &quot;OH WOW, Trish,&quot; Lindsay said in a quiet tone, short 
                of breath. &quot;That feels so GOOD...&quot;<p>
                &quot;I know it does,&quot; Trish told her, grinning, as she gently 
                began to thrust those fingers in-and-out of Lindsay's anus. &quot;What 
                did you like to call yourself during the summer, baby?<p>
                A... butt-slut, if I remember correctly.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yes,&quot; Lindsay said in reply, her voice still low and 
                breathless. &quot;I... I love getting my ass fucked.&quot;<p>
                With those words, I let out a wild, animalistic growl. Hearing 
                anything which had to do with Lindsay's perfect ass was usually 
                enough to drive me totally insane with lust.<p>
                I had been busy stroking my cock for quite some time, of course, 
                but was surprised that their verbal exchange did not make me cum. 
                In fact, I was very surprised.<p>
                On the other hand, the wild growl I let out perhaps got both ladies 
                to notice me for the first time since stepping into my personal 
                suite. They had been so totally focused upon one another, but 
                now... both of them looked at me.<p>
                &quot;Are you okay, Jeremy?&quot; Trish asked with a grin, her 
                two fingers picking up speed as she drilled the teen's ass.<p>
                &quot;I'm fine, dear,&quot; I replied, paying extra attention 
                to the grunts and squeals which were coming from Lindsay. &quot;I 
                would be a lot better, though, if I could get in on some of this 
                fun, too. What do you say?&quot;<p>
                &quot;You don't have to ask,&quot; Trish replied, smiling.<p>
                &quot;Y-You've been th-there, whacking off the wh-whole time,&quot;<p>
                Lindsay managed to blurt out, her body already starting to shudder 
                about in erotic fulfillment. &quot;We-We th-thought that was all-all 
                you w-wa-wanted to do-do-do.&quot;<p>
                Those words made me feel good, in a certain way - at least I hadn't 
                been forgotten about. Lindsay had been aware of my presence - 
                though it certainly did not seem that way.<p>
                &quot;Why not come over here so I can suck your cock,&quot; Trish 
                said to me, still grinning, &quot;while I fuck Lindsay's ass?&quot;<p>
                Not needing to be asked a second time, I immediately got rid of 
                both my trousers and my briefs. I ripped my shirt off next (tearing 
                it in two, actually), then made my way over to the quivering couple 
                upon the bed.<p>
                Trish was seated close to the edge, with Lindsay sprawled out 
                across her lap. As I stood before them, Trish offered me a smile 
                before grasping my erection with her left (free) hand. A split-second 
                later, she leaned her head forward and engulfed the entire length 
                of my cock with her hungry mouth.<p>
                Lindsay continued to grunt and squeal in response to the dual 
                finger-pumping in her rectum, courtesy of Trish and her right 
                hand. At the same time, however, I joined the chorus of sounds 
                with some rather loud moans and sighs of my own.<p>
                Trish looked up into my eyes and showed absolutely no hesitation 
                as she feverishly sucked my cock. Lost in an abyss of passion 
                and pleasure, I reached down with both hands and cupped Trish's 
                big breasts, squeezing them firmly.<p>
                She responded to that by bobbing her head back-and-forth upon 
                my cock in an up-tempo, steady motion. I closed my eyes and sighed, 
                trying to keep my composure and balance. Trish really knew what 
                to do when presented with a cock...<p>
                &quot;OH FUCK YES!&quot; I heard Lindsay scream, which caused 
                me to remember that she was in on this encounter, too. Glancing 
                down, I now noticed that Trish was absolutely BLASTING the teen-ager's 
                sweet ass with her two fingers.<p>
                Lindsay's whole body was alive with pure arousal as she squirmed 
                and writhed about upon her lover's lap, her ass getting pounded. 
                It seemed as though Trish could not do it any harder. She was 
                PUMMELING Lindsay's little rectum...<p>
                The dual combination of Trish's mouth worshipping my cock and 
                Lindsay's squealy screams was finally enough to send me over the 
                proverbial edge. In fact, I FELL over that edge...<p>
                All of a sudden - and without any warning, I pulled my erection 
                out from within Trish's mouth and grasped it with my right hand. 
                An instant later, I was growling like an animal again as my cock 
                simply erupted - like a volcano.<p>
                The first spurt landed on Trish's tongue, after which some if 
                began to dribble out of her mouth and onto her heaving breasts. 
                My next blast went all over her face and mouth, coating her completely, 
                before the final (smaller) shot of cum landed directly upon her 
                immaculate blonde hair.<p>
                In the aftermath, all I could do was stagger away from Trish in 
                satisfaction. I was extremely lucky there was a chair to catch 
                me, because I lost my footing and fell back. Fortunately, I landed 
                right in it.</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>Lindsay may be a butt-slut, as Trish said, but she also qualified 
                as a definite cum-slut. Knowing I had just blown my load all over 
                Trish's face, Lindsay immediately sat up and embraced her lover, 
                and began to kiss and lick her face.<p>
                Both ladies giggled like schoolgirls as Lindsay scooped a large 
                helping of sperm from Trish's cheek with her tongue, before offering 
                it to her mouth. Trish extended her own tongue and took the big 
                glob, before both of them giggled once again and shared a hard, 
                deep-rooted kiss.<p>
                &quot;How's your sweet, little ass feel?&quot; Trish asked, snickering, 
                once the kiss ended seconds later.<p>
                &quot;Very well-fucked,&quot; Lindsay giggled in response. &quot;You 
                can do that to me with your fingers anytime you want!&quot;<p>
                Trish looked over at me as I slumped in the chair, a hand grasping 
                my now-limp cock. &quot;You're just the same as I remember you, 
                Jeremy,&quot; she said with a grin. &quot;Always tired, and worn-down. 
                Have all these girls here been keeping you busy this past week?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Extremely busy,&quot; I corrected her, sighing heavily.<p>
                &quot;You can add me to that group,&quot; Trish smiled. &quot;I'm 
                gonna<p>
                be here for as long as Lindsay wants me to be here.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You're never leaving my sight again,&quot; Lindsay said 
                to Trish, grasping her shoulders. &quot;NEVER. I won't let you.&quot;<p>
                The Canadian smiled at Lindsay, then turned her attention toward 
                me. &quot;Jeremy? Whenever you are... UP, to it... feel free to 
                jump in here, anytime you want.&quot; Trish pushed her young lover 
                onto her back, upon the bed, and spread her thighs with both hands. 
                The teen-ager sighed in response as Trish rolled over onto her 
                elbows and knees, her face positioned directly between Lindsay's 
                outstretched thighs.<p>
                Just before she was about to dive into that delicious, all-you-can-eat 
                buffet, Trish turned her head and smiled back at me. &quot;Remember... 
                anytime you want, Jeremy. Just jump on in. I'd LOVE for you to 
                fuck my pussy while I make Lindsay scream, with my tongue.&quot;<p>
                As the 19-year-old roared in utter passion upon the initial tongue-to-pussy 
                contact, I moaned in response to Trish's nasty words and immediately 
                began stroking my cock.<p>
                This night was FAR from being over...</p>
