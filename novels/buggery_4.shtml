              <p>Sharon and Tracey left the teachers the following day, although 
                they had hardly began to recover from either their trudge through 
                Buggery or from their beatings by Tiger Lilly. A dark blue (nearly 
                black) bruise had swollen up around Sharon's eye, and both girls' 
                legs were criss-crossed with scratches and discoloured by more 
                bruises. They could barely stand up as they tottered by the door 
                to the cottage, in the unfamiliar flat plastic sandals they'd 
                been given in exchange for the shoes they'd worn the day before. 
                Despite their looks, the two girls were showered with affectionate 
                kisses from Primrose and Chrysanthemum. Somehow this in no way 
                fully compensated for their treatment from Tiger Lilly. Tracey 
                was almost sure that she would never want sex with anyone ever 
                again, and Sharon certainly didn't feel like it today.<p>
                They took with them a cheap printed map of Buggery that Primrose 
                lent them. It was one which she had in stock for her Geography 
                lessons and was an official map of the country. It showed roads, 
                woods, rivers, lakes, towns and villages; but large patches of 
                the map were left suspiciously blank: lacking all colour or contour. 
                No clues were given by the map as to what they were, but nearly 
                one quarter of the map was left like this. Chrysanthemum explained 
                that although it was impossible to be sure, most of these blanked 
                out areas would represent the private lands of the monarchy and 
                the rest of the aristocracy. Though it was possible that they 
                also included areas of military significance and the mysterious 
                breeding centres. Of the parts of the map that was clearly outlined, 
                the most distinct were the capital city and the Tourist spots. 
                However, there weren't many of the latter on the road to Gomorrah. 
                <p>
                &quot;Although the boundary line signifying the border with Gomorrah 
                is very clearly marked on the map, I wouldn't really trust it,&quot; 
                warned Primrose. &quot;During a war the border is bound to shift 
                as one side makes advances and the other retreats. After all, 
                territorial advantage is what it's all about. However, I don't 
                know for sure, but I believe the border might actually be significantly 
                nearer than the map says. Of course all the official news we get 
                from the front says that Buggery's really doing well, and making 
                significant gains which bring closer the promise of final victory 
                and the settling of the nation's grievances. However, from what 
                few signs we get, and this is only speculation, I don't think 
                things are going that well. The good news is generally unsubstantiated 
                and implausible. There's rather a lot more about Gomorran atrocities 
                than about Buggerian advances. And you may have noticed that there 
                aren't many men about.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Indeed,&quot; corroborated Chrysanthemum with a broad grin. 
                &quot;Almost all them are out on the front, fighting for King 
                and Country; leaving us poor helpless girls to fend for ourselves 
                and to make do with whatever we can.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I think that your walk to the front will be rather less 
                than the one hundred kilometres on the map,&quot; continued Primrose, 
                &quot;but before you get there you'll have to cross a war zone 
                and that'll include some sort of no-man's land where you could 
                very easily get killed. But put it into perspective. Although 
                you might get killed crossing the front, the longer you stay in 
                Buggery the more chance that you'd get killed anyway.&quot;<p>
                This was scarcely comforting news, but it was this news that the 
                girls took as they walked away from the teachers' cottage. Their 
                advice was to avoid walking along the roads where they could be 
                easily picked off by the police. In fact, the road to Gomorrah 
                took them away from the dry barren plains of the district where 
                the teachers lived to a more hilly landscape where there would 
                be more than enough woodland for the girls to walk out of sight 
                of the main road. Or at least to dodge into if they saw them. 
                It was unlikely, Primrose reasoned, that the disappearance of 
                two tourists from Pederasty would have gone unnoticed for very 
                long. Already everyone who'd seen them would have been interrogated, 
                and possibly tortured, by the police. Tracey shivered slightly 
                thinking of the young courier, Little Pussy, and the young boy 
                they'd had come to their room. However, although the police were 
                brutal, Primrose explained, making sure that Tiger Lilly wasn't 
                within earshot, they were remarkably inefficient at actually doing 
                anything other than intimidate people. As an investigative police 
                agency, they were absolutely hopeless. They had had no impact 
                at all on the smuggling of hard drugs and guns that happened around 
                the country's border. And they had had no capacity to deal with 
                the many deserters that kept away from the towns and villages. 
                The semblance of law and order was only held by the fact that 
                no one who was caught was ever likely to re-offend. <p>
                Their breakfast of fruit and orange juice was really not enough 
                to sustain Sharon and Tracey on their long walk. In fact, being 
                fairly exhausted before they'd even started walking, they were 
                certainly no better after an hour or more of trudge along the 
                featureless dry roads. If they'd seen any police there was nowhere 
                to hide as there were no trees nor even bushes to retreat to. 
                After a while, however, their walk took them up a steep incline 
                and soon they were in the very welcome shade of some woods. The 
                goal which comforted on their despairing walk was the small town 
                of Butterfly Grove which they could see marked on the map, and 
                finally to the delight of their sore feet, they could see in reality. 
                <p>
                It was not a very picturesque town, despite its name. Although 
                surrounded by a thick forest of trees, it was a dry unprepossessing 
                place composed mostly of small hut-like houses with a small market 
                in the middle. They walked towards it with the hope of something 
                to eat, or at the least something to drink. They soon found that 
                the Buggery Dinar went considerably further in Buggery than it 
                would have done in Throb, and much further again than it would 
                have done at home. In fact, they found that they were carrying 
                a relative fortune around with them. <p>
                It wasn't that easy to find anything edible to buy though. Both 
                of them had mostly subsisted on take-aways and microwaveable dishes 
                at home here, and the only thing on sale they knew what to do 
                with was the battered and unappealing fruit they could see. But 
                they managed to buy some apples, oranges, a packet of tasteless 
                biscuits and a couple of bottles of distilled water on which the 
                King's face was prominently displayed. There was no Coke. Or even 
                Pepsi or Dr Pepper's. There were no hamburgers, pizzas, hot dogs 
                or doner kebabs. Not even a pasty or a bag of chips. But what 
                they had was undeniably food and it certainly filled some of the 
                hole they could feel in their stomachs.<p>
                What was even worse, as they discovered to their cost, was that 
                there was nowhere selling any ciggies. Not only were they no decent 
                ciggies like 5th Avenue or Edinboro's, but not even rollies like 
                Gold Cup or cheap tabs like Old Street Plain. They had half a 
                packet of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead's Silk Tip between them, but 
                it was clearly not going to last them very long. The days were 
                definitely going to stretch ahead now they had to cope with withdrawal 
                symptoms as well as hunger.<p>
                The townspeople of Butterfly Grove dressed much the same as all 
                the people they'd seen in Buggery. What few clothes they wore 
                were fairly skimpy and did not cover the crotch at all. Despite 
                having got so accustomed to the sight of genitalia in Throb, it 
                still seemed strange to see all these naked crotches and even 
                the occasional dangling penis. It was clear that the men and women 
                generally dressed in exactly the same clothes with very similar 
                hairstyles: but there were so few adult men, it took the girls 
                a while to be sure of this. <p>
                &quot;How come there are so few blokes?&quot; Sharon asked the 
                woman at the stall who served them the distilled water.<p>
                &quot;Do you have more men in the district where you come from?&quot; 
                wondered the woman, as she gave the girls their change. &quot;I 
                thought it was the same everywhere. It's the war. It's so difficult 
                to find a man that you have to share those you can find.&quot; 
                <p>
                This didn't sound much fun to Sharon or Tracey, who were already 
                missing the cock they'd got so used to in Throb. This did not 
                sound like a good place to be man-hungry. However, they had a 
                long walk ahead of them, so despite their weariness, they shouldered 
                their bags and returned to the road which thanks to the shade 
                of the thick forestry made their walk somewhat less arduous than 
                when they were exposed to the sun. Nonetheless, they weren't used 
                to any kind of walking, and soon they were stopping to rest for 
                longer than the time they spent walking.<p>
                Fortunately every few miles there was another town or village 
                they could stop at to replenish themselves. None of them were 
                any better than Butterfly Grove. Indeed, they were generally rather 
                worse. There seemed to be a pattern that the more picturesque 
                the name, the worse the places were. Leafy Vale was bare of any 
                vegetation at all. Paradise Hill was pretty filthy and was distinguished 
                by the foul smell coming out of the chimneys of an ugly factory. 
                Bluebell Dell was the most miserable tangle of derelict houses 
                they'd ever seen. <p>
                Nowhere were there shops as the girls understood them from home: 
                just market stalls. The homes were constructed as square shaped 
                concrete flats or were thrown together from corrugated iron, mud 
                and cardboard. Very few roads were paved, and then only for a 
                few hundred metres at a time. <p>
                Sharon and Tracey soon got to recognise the police from a distance. 
                It seemed that the police were everywhere. In every village, in 
                every town and between each of them. Fortunately, however, they 
                didn't seem to pay much notice to the girls, so Primrose's advice 
                as to what to wear had seemed to bear fruit. However, to be on 
                the safe side Sharon and Tracey kept as respectable distance between 
                themselves and any police-woman (or occasionally police-man) as 
                they could. Primrose's warnings had frightened the wits out of 
                them. Although the police wore no more clothes than anyone else, 
                what they wore was aggressive and in leather. They made no attempt 
                to hide their dildo-shaped truncheons, and some of them even carried 
                submachine guns. <p>
                They soon became aware that they weren't the only ones avoiding 
                them. Almost everyone kept apart from them. People crossed the 
                road, or even turned around and walked the other way whenever 
                the police came into sight. It was early evening, when the girls 
                were even more exhausted and even now wondering where they would 
                sleep the night, they saw two or three police-women marching through 
                the market where they were buying some more snacky groceries. 
                All the other people cleared out of the police's way as they wandered 
                into their midst. As they walked, the police took things from 
                market stalls without bothering to say anything or acknowledge 
                the stall-holders, let alone offer to pay for what they'd taken. 
                <p>
                Then one stall-holder must have said or gestured something to 
                which the police-women took exception. From their vantage point 
                several stalls away, they saw the police pile onto the stall-holder. 
                She was punched, kicked and then, when she'd fallen onto the ground, 
                they took turns to bugger her. Her cries were loud and agonised 
                as they roughly forced the dildos which they'd tied around their 
                crotches into her arse and pushed her against the piles of clothes 
                and sandals she'd been selling. Neither Sharon nor Tracey felt 
                like staying around too long to see what ultimately happened to 
                the stall-holder or whether they'd focus their attention onto 
                some other unfortunate.<p>
                The two girls took Primrose's advice not to sleep in any of the 
                towns. But as the evening descended, and they got more and more 
                tired, it was difficult to see anywhere that they could sleep. 
                They were looking for a barn or a deserted home outside the towns 
                and villages to sleep in, but although they'd seen a few like 
                that during the day, when they actually needed it, there didn't 
                seem to be any around. They were getting progressively more exhausted 
                and were actually resting more often than they were walking. The 
                night was drawing in, and it was obvious that they needed to stop 
                somewhere. They eventually settled on a broken-down barn some 
                ten metres from the road, and settled on the ragged-looking straw. 
                This was not a pleasant night. They found straw creeping up their 
                bare vaginas and were frightened when some animal sniffed inquisitively 
                outside, but they were so exhausted that they were asleep within 
                minutes, after sharing every small grain of their last W&amp;M's 
                Silk Tip.<p>
                Unusually for them, the two girls awoke on the first rays of light, 
                and more from the discomfort of all the straw, they got walking 
                again almost immediately, following the route which led on their 
                map towards Gomorrah. For girls who never went anywhere at home 
                without a taxi or bus, it was not easy getting used to walking 
                quite long distances every day following the winding roads on 
                the map. Their walks gave them an appetite which was not at all 
                satisfied by the fairly basic food provided by the next market 
                they got to. No coffee, no chips, no chicken fritters. Only boiled 
                eggs, fruit and bottles of distilled water. <p>
                Their route took them through woods which skirted near an area 
                which was marked as forbidden, but all they could see of it were 
                high brick walls crowned with broken glass and barbed wire. Sharon 
                couldn't help wondering what was on the other side, but the height 
                of the walls, let alone its unwelcoming ornamentation put her 
                off any inclination she might have had of clambering over to investigate. 
                The forbidding walls betrayed no clues as to what there was behind 
                them that put them out of bounds. However, Tracey noted that where 
                there were forbidden areas, there would almost certainly be police 
                nearby, so the girls kept as reasonable a distance between themselves 
                and the walls as they could, while keeping them in sight. Otherwise, 
                they would get totally lost. The paths through the woods were 
                quite narrow and winding, probably marked out by wild animals 
                (of which they only saw the odd deer or rabbit). At times it was 
                hard-going, but they kept on going despite their increasing discomfort, 
                weariness and pain.<p>
                There were not many people to be seen wandering about the woods 
                or along the road when they rejoined it. The woods were empty 
                of any sign of continued habitation, although they saw the odd 
                derelict cottage or out-building. Even along the road, they passed 
                very few other people. Most of these seemed to be going to work 
                in the fields or going to school. <p>
                The only real travellers they passed that day were what they judged 
                from Primrose's account to be Sodomite Pilgrims. They were travelling 
                in a group of less than a dozen individuals, and the girls found 
                them to be a very distressing sight. It was possible that underneath 
                the scars, bondage and tattoos, some of the Sodomite Pilgrims 
                might have been quite pretty. As Sharon and Tracey approached, 
                the Pilgrims stop walking, and stood by so the two friends had 
                more than enough opportunity to appraise them. Some of the Sodomites 
                turned round and bowed to the girls with their bottoms facing 
                upward. It was an extremely disturbing sight. The female sodomites 
                had their vaginas threaded together very crudely with leather 
                or metal stitches. The men had their genitals removed and wore 
                them strung around their necks. It might have been true that all 
                the Sodomite Pilgrims had had their tongues torn out (although 
                there was no way of being sure without a closer look) but quite 
                a few had had their hands amputated. Sharon winced at the sight 
                of these stumps. <p>
                When later, they passed some other Sodomite Pilgrims in the next 
                village, they found that even the native people from Buggery found 
                them a disturbing sight. They were making diversions around these 
                pilgrims rather than experience the discomfort of having to see 
                them more clearly. At this village, there was a shrine which the 
                Sodomite Pilgrims were prostrating themselves in front of. This 
                was marked only by some very crude scratches on some scattered 
                rocks. <p>
                After this, they soon spotted other similar shrines which seemed 
                to be scattered fairly randomly about the Buggery countryside. 
                After their small unappetising snack in the village, they passed 
                another shrine in the wood, where they also found two Sodomite 
                Pilgrims whipping each other with barbed wire whips which was 
                raising blood on their welted backs. This annoyed them because 
                the shrine was by a deserted cottage that Sharon and Tracey had 
                spotted from a distance and had been so hoping to rest at. The 
                sight of these two Sodomites, definitely persuaded them to change 
                their mind. It would not be at all pleasant to sleep or rest near 
                girls as deformed as these. One Pilgrim's leg was missing from 
                the thigh and there was a hole in the eye-socket where the eye 
                should have been.<p>
                Another shrine they saw surrounded by Sodomite Pilgrims prostrated 
                or beating each other was probably of significance to the citizens 
                of Buggery. This commemorated a battle fought against the Sodomites 
                in a war some two or three centuries earlier. There was an extremely 
                partisan inscription on the plinth which described in detail the 
                atrocities the Sodomites had committed. On top of this was the 
                statue at the top was of a naked man with long hair buggering 
                a bald man whilst also taking the opportunity to slice off his 
                genitals with a sword. The sculptor had seen fit to sculpt very 
                realistic globules of blood in the marble.<p>
                Most of the many monuments in Buggery the girls saw, however, 
                were of a generally more contemporary nature and by far the majority 
                featured the King. He was a grand, moustachioed, undeniably handsome, 
                man with the most gorgeous raiments and long hair flowing over 
                his shoulders; always in a classic heroic pose. His features could 
                be seen on billboards, statues or just portraits in prominent 
                positions in shops or above the doorways of the homes. There was 
                often text associated with such images which praised the King 
                for his heroism in fighting the Gomorran barbarians, his sagacity 
                in his dealings with the outside world, his generosity and kindness 
                towards his citizens, his love of justice, his lust for knowledge 
                and, in one peculiar place, his sexual prowess.<p>
                Later in the afternoon, Sharon and Tracey were in a larger town. 
                This was the largest town they'd seen since Throb, but in comparison 
                it was relatively small. While shopping in the market for more 
                food (which was of a greater variety than they'd seen for a while), 
                they couldn't help noticing a slightly nervous air in the village 
                market. At first, they thought it was to do with themselves, but 
                it soon became that they were not the only visitor to the town. 
                A dignitary was also passing through the village. This was announced 
                by a shrill scream of sirens and then, through a cloud of dust, 
                the sudden emergence of a thundercloud of motorbikes driven by 
                police, who showed no concern that anyone might be in the way. 
                In the middle of this cavalcade was a stretch limousine with darkened 
                windows. And then, as soon as it had arrived, the visitor was 
                gone without a pause or any evidence of noticing the village and 
                its banners and flags which had been put up to welcome the dignitary's 
                visit. There was, in fact, an air of relief from the townspeople 
                as they now started to remove these spurned items from around 
                the town.<p>
                The two girls wandered back into the woods just beyond the town 
                which according to their map promised to be the shortest route 
                to Gomorrah. The map was rather unhelpful at this stage, showing 
                wood but also large areas which were left totally blank. At first 
                Sharon thought it was some reservoir or lake, but, no, the area 
                was coloured by purple rather than blue. More forbidden territory.<p>
                They found this wood somewhat harder to get through than the woodland 
                they had been through earlier, because the clearly marked path 
                was obstructed by trees that had recently fallen and had been 
                left to rot. So they decided to make a slight detour into the 
                thick of the wood. It was after only a few hundred metres of walking 
                as parallel to what they judged to be the right route when they 
                heard a low moaning sound. <p>
                &quot;Ignore it,&quot; said Sharon nervously. &quot;It's probably 
                some Buggery animal. A bird or something.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Fucking funny bird,&quot; commented Tracey. &quot;I'm sure 
                I heard it say something. A word of some kind.&quot;<p>
                &quot;What word?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I don't fucking know!&quot; Tracey said walking towards 
                it.<p>
                &quot;It's probably some Sodomite praying or something,&quot; 
                commented Sharon. She nervously paused by a large elm, but seeing 
                her friend's determination she then reluctantly followed Tracey, 
                who had clearly found someone or something in a clearing in the 
                wood ahead of them. <p>
                The girl they found sobbing softly in the shade of the trees wasn't 
                a Sodomite, but she was still in a wretched state. She wore no 
                clothes. Her hair was totally shaved. Her face was covered in 
                bruises, and there was a nasty cut on her forehead above the eye. 
                There was a large bruise on her thigh and another one just under 
                her breast. A thin trail of blood was dripping from a badly split 
                lip, and a few of her teeth were missing. Judging from the blood 
                on her cheek, this may well have happened quite recently. There 
                was also a slight smell about her which Sharon and Tracey guessed 
                from the slight gleam on her skin was because she'd been pissed 
                on, and by probably quite a few people. There was a patch on her 
                buttock which might have been mud: but on such a dry day was more 
                probably shit. She sat with her head down and her legs open pulling 
                at her pubic hair and they could see that amongst the hair was 
                rather brown stuff and dried blood which must have resulted from 
                some quite brutal penetration.<p>
                &quot;Are you all right, love?&quot; asked Tracey sympathetically, 
                bending down and placing a hand on the girl's bare shoulder.<p>
                The girl looked up at them with the frightened gaze of a wild 
                animal. She was about fourteen or fifteen years old, with perky 
                young breasts and a very slender, ill-fed body. Her slim legs 
                were just a little too bony to be attractive. Nor did her broken 
                nose enhance her looks in any way. She shrunk back at the sight 
                of the girls. &quot;Are you going to beat me, too?&quot; she asked 
                in a resigned voice.<p>
                &quot;No, of course not love,&quot; Sharon commented, feeling 
                a curious sense of mutual sympathy and even warmth towards this 
                victim of abuse. &quot;Why should we do that?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Everyone else does.&quot;<p>
                &quot;And why do they do that?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Because I'm Z grade,&quot; sobbed the girl. &quot;They're 
                always picking on me. Buggering me. Shitting on me. Kicking me. 
                Pissing on me. Pulling out my teeth. Sticking things into the 
                back of my throat and long things up my arse. Punching me. All 
                the time.&quot; <p>
                &quot;Who do?&quot; wondered Tracey.<p>
                &quot;All the girls at school. All the A grades and B grades and 
                C grades and all the other grades. And not just them, but lots 
                of other people. It's to punish me for not being good at school. 
                Because I don't do well at sports. Because I don't do well at 
                lessons. It's not fair. I don't get the chance. The teachers only 
                give me jobs like licking the messy girls' arses clean, or drinking 
                their piss, or carrying shit in my hands to the fields for fertiliser. 
                I'm always the one who gets given the whip during the festivals. 
                I've had two of my teeth torn out by pliers by the headmaster 
                on one of those. And I get buggered at least three or four times 
                a day. And if there's a speck of shit on their pricks, I have 
                to do duty in licking it off. God! I hate the taste of shit. Dry 
                or wet, it's all disgusting. But sometimes it's all I get to eat 
                all day.&quot;<p>
                &quot;How did you get to be Z grade?&quot; wondered Sharon, who 
                like Tracey had never been remotely near the top of their classes 
                when they were children. They may even have been at the bottom 
                of their class for all they knew, but they never really bothered 
                to attend school to find out for sure. School was just a place 
                for meeting boys and something to do on wet days.<p>
                &quot;I haven't always been Z grade! Once I was C grade. OK. Not 
                A or B, but C's pretty good. I had long hair halfway down my back, 
                I wore these wonderful red trousers with really nice seams and 
                I had a little plastic bracelet (that was really expensive). I 
                didn't have a broken nose, and I'd hardly ever tasted shit.&quot; 
                She sniffed sadly at these memories. &quot;And then, I don't know, 
                things seemed to slip. It wasn't that one day, I was C and the 
                next I was Z. No. Things weren't like that. I'd even thought I 
                stood a chance of graduating to B! I had quite a good body and 
                a lot of teachers said my oral was really good. It still is ...&quot; 
                She looked up at Sharon with a sad smile. &quot;Do you want some 
                oral?&quot; <p>
                Sharon shook her head firmly and sadly.<p>
                &quot;Anyway, I didn't do too well on this test on ancient history. 
                I thought I'd answered it well enough, but I always confuse our 
                past kings, and apparently I'd said that one king was a good king 
                when he had really been a bad king. And also I'd mixed up Our 
                Blessed and Magnificent King's mother with his disgraced Aunt: 
                the mother of the past deposed Most Despicable and Damned King. 
                Then it all started a decline. My hair was cut shorter and shorter. 
                I wasn't allowed to shave my pubic hair. My bracelet was taken 
                from me and given to another girl: a grade A (and I bet she's 
                never tasted any shit in all her life!) When I got down to Q grade, 
                my blouse was removed and I was forbidden to wear clothes ever 
                again. When I got down to W grade, I was told never to appear 
                in public without having all my hair shaved off. And now I'm in 
                the lowest grade of all. And I don't think I'll be allowed to 
                stay there long.&quot;<p>
                &quot;How long have you been Z grade?&quot; wondered Tracey.<p>
                &quot;Two weeks. Maybe three. It's been so horrible, I just can't 
                say. I'm not even allowed to do sex rota for even M grades, let 
                alone A grades. I have to stand in all my lessons. I'm not allowed 
                to sit. And I have to do stocks on Friday, where you get things 
                thrown at you.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Stocks?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well, someone's got to do it. That's how my nose got broken 
                last week. It's not just shit and semen that gets thrown at you. 
                Someone, probably an X grade or a W (they're the worst), threw 
                something heavy at me. But they didn't take me down even with 
                all the blood gushing out and the pain. It was horrible. And I 
                got beaten up this evening too.&quot;<p>
                &quot;We can see,&quot; said Sharon sympathetically.<p>
                &quot;It was four or five H grades. Two of them boys. It was horrible. 
                I can't even remember what they shoved up me. I just know it really 
                hurt. And all the shit and piss! I couldn't see through my eyes. 
                They were so caked up for so long! And I bet they did me permanent 
                damage. Hell! I wish I was dead!&quot;<p>
                &quot;It sounds horrible.&quot;<p>
                &quot;And I'm going to get beaten up and buggered and shat on 
                when I get home to punish me for having got into this state. And 
                when I get to school tomorrow, I'll be beaten up for the bruises 
                and having lost another tooth. And I'll fail shit inspection because 
                there'll be blood in my stools.&quot;<p>
                &quot;This can't really be happening to you,&quot; said Sharon 
                sadly.<p>
                The girl stood up beside Sharon and Tracey, revealing a scar along 
                the side of one breast and gazed at the two girls through the 
                black and blue swelling around her left eye. This contrasted badly 
                with her other eye which was merely red with tears. &quot;It is,&quot; 
                she said philosophically. &quot;I won't see my sixteenth birthday 
                at this rate. Either I'll be sent to the Gomorran front with the 
                mine clearance corps where I'll be dead in a week or I'll be dead 
                like the X grade girl who was found impaled on a pole through 
                her arse with a dead rabbit stuck in her mouth. She'd been accused 
                of trimming her pubic hair.&quot; She looked at the two girls, 
                gulped slowly. &quot;You've been very kind to me. I promise I 
                won't report you for not beating me up and for listening to me. 
                I must go, or I'll be beaten up for lateness.&quot;<p>
                She then turned away and hobbled away on her bruised legs with 
                a limp that had probably been caused by her beatings. Her back 
                was covered with scars which covered her to her skinny buttocks 
                which themselves were also latticed with fine scars. Sharon and 
                Tracey watched with a certain degree of disgusted fascination 
                as she disappeared out of sight amongst the darkening shadows 
                of the trees.<p>
                &quot;If I'd been born in this fucking country, I'd have fucking 
                given everything to avoid an education in it!&quot; commented 
                Tracey.<p>
                VII
              <p>The woods seemed to go on and on, broken only by the odd deserted 
                cottage and broken stonework which must have represented some 
                old temple or other. The two friends found very little to eat, 
                but resourcefulness was a new skill they'd learnt: they'd actually 
                prepared for this long walk by buying more food with them than 
                they could eat in a single sitting. And fucking heavy it was too. 
                As they plodded along, they wondered whether there might not be 
                some wild animals in the wood, but the fiercest animals they saw 
                were feral dogs who seemed as frightened of them as the girls 
                were of the dogs.<p>
                Their route ran parallel to a tall wall, some twenty feet high, 
                which delineated the purple area on the map. They walked close 
                by the wall for a few hours, as it was a sure way of ensuring 
                they didn't lose where they were on the map; but then they caught 
                sight of some police marching along the edge of the wall in the 
                distance. They were striding aggressively forward in leathers, 
                carrying sub-machine guns and wearing dildos strapped around their 
                waists. They were making no effort to avoid being seen, but even 
                so Sharon and Tracey thought it would be unwise to encounter them. 
                They'd learnt enough from Tiger Lilly what police attention might 
                entail. <p>
                So, while the police were still several hundred metres away and 
                loudly talking to each other, the two girls took the diversion 
                of a lesser path through the woods that was clearly enough marked, 
                and from which could still be seen the shadow of the wall. They 
                hid behind a tree as the police marched by, trembling slightly 
                at the thought of being discovered. It was only when they were 
                sure the police had gone, they emerged and continued their scrambling, 
                stumbling walk through the shadows of the forest; all the while 
                being able to glimpse the unwelcoming grey and granite brickwork 
                of the wall through the snatches of light through the trees. <p>
                The two girls continued their walk through the forest for all 
                the rest of the day, often regretting the comfort of the ciggies 
                they'd finished and missing the familiar taste of chips and burgers. 
                It was a dispiriting day's walk. The woods went on and on, with 
                only the occasional gap in the trees where they could rest in 
                the sun on the slightly damp moss, amongst weeds and the occasional 
                small flower. Their legs attracted stings and scratches which 
                left unhealthy bluish colours amongst a lattice of small reddish 
                lines and the occasional reddish or even yellowish blemish. At 
                least it wasn't so hot, but they still didn't risk putting on 
                any more clothes than the small blouses Primrose had lent them. 
                They worried about the midges and other small insects that nestled 
                in the growing hair of their vaginas, but the odd sting between 
                the thighs was as nothing compared to the constant ache of their 
                legs and the far more unpleasant stings that their bare ankles 
                seemed to especially attract. <p>
                As they walked, the only evidence of their not being lost was 
                the wall, and the only recognisable land-mark on their map; so 
                whatever they did they didn't stray too far from it. But the penalty 
                of walking through the woods were even more scratches from the 
                odd brambles, bruises, stings; and now they were getting awful 
                red marks on their shoulders as a result of the weight of the 
                food pulling down on the shoulder straps of their bags. Sharon 
                had a nasty scratch from a tree that trailed across one of her 
                breasts. Tracey had a bruise just above her eye where she had 
                hit a branch which was beginning to swell up and was starting 
                to challenge the prominence of the one Tiger Lilly had bestowed 
                on Sharon's eye. <p>
                They had an uncomfortable night's sleep in the shadow of the trees, 
                heartily tired of the food they had brought to eat, gasping for 
                ciggies, as nicotine withdrawal began to really kick in, and finding 
                it impossible to find a patch of ground where there were no insects, 
                mulch or brambles. They had seen no one during the day except 
                the brief sight of the police, and no evidence that anyone lived 
                anywhere near where they were. On the map, the purple patch delineated 
                by the wall stretched on for dozens of kilometres, whilst in the 
                other direction, the green which marked the forest they were in 
                seemed to stretch even further in all directions. But eventually, 
                the map showed both forest and purple enclosure coming to an abrupt 
                end by an area of light blue, which must be a lake or reservoir 
                or something.<p>
                The following day was no less dispiriting, as Tracey and Sharon 
                continued their bare-arsed walk through the woods. They were no 
                less tired, and irritable, and found even the smallest conversation 
                more and more difficult. Sharon comforted herself by swearing 
                constantly, while Tracey found that she was somehow unable to 
                stop herself from a miserable kind of sobbing. Whenever it was 
                necessary to talk to each other, it was in monosyllabic grunts 
                relating to practical things that had to be done. Both of them 
                feared the consequences of vocalising the increasing desperation 
                they were feeling. They were lonely, hungry, tired, aching and 
                anxious. <p>
                Despair was steadily growing at the sight of yet more imposing 
                trees and the monotony of green, with no human company. And then 
                they came to a clearing in the woods lit by a golden beam from 
                the sun which burst through the shadows of the trees and illuminated 
                some blue and yellow flowers that flourished in the glow. And 
                there, like a dream or an illustration in a fairy tale, was probably 
                the most beautiful girl that either Sharon or Tracey had ever 
                seen. <p>
                She was walking about uncertainly, and seemed as glad as Sharon 
                and Tracey to be in such a relatively beautiful part of the forest. 
                She had golden hair which cascaded to her waist. She had a beautiful 
                slender figure. Her breasts reflected in the sun with contours 
                normally only seen in classical sculptures. She wore no clothes 
                at all; and the lightly tanned flesh of her skin radiated a faintly 
                golden glow. Neither Sharon nor Tracey had spoken to anyone for 
                nearly two days, but they were both struck by a sudden shyness. 
                Was it reluctance in meeting a stranger. Or perhaps it was the 
                feeling of being utterly outclassed by a stranger.<p>
                The girl looked in their direction with no fear and no similar 
                shyness. &quot;Hello there,&quot; announced the girl, smiling 
                broadly and welcomingly. Her teeth shone in the dappled sunlight 
                with a whiteness the girls had only ever seen before on toothpaste 
                commercials. &quot;My name's Buttercup. What are yours?&quot; 
                <p>
                &quot;Tracey,&quot; announced Tracey, dropping her bag and feeling 
                a strange burning warmth creep up from her breast to her forehead.<p>
                &quot;And I'm Sharon,&quot; said her friend, approached the girl 
                and taking note of just how different from all the people in Buggery 
                they'd seen since they'd left Throb. Just like the people they'd 
                seen on Buggery television, she was totally naked with no hint 
                of any tan-lines or clothing. Similarly like everyone on television, 
                all her pubic and other bodily hair was shaved off, although a 
                trace of stubble betrayed a couple of days of neglect. And there 
                was the ubiquitous small ring dangling from the lips of her vagina.<p>
                &quot;Where am I? Am I near a town?&quot; Buttercup asked innocently.<p>
                &quot;No fucking way,&quot; said Sharon. She pulled the map out 
                of her bag and opened it up on the ground. Buttercup knelt down 
                and looked at it with a quizzical air. She frowned as if trying 
                to comprehend what she was looking at. &quot;It's a long fucking 
                way to the nearest town, I'm afraid,&quot; Sharon continued circling 
                a finger over the approximate area that they were. &quot;How come 
                you don't know? Don't you live round here?&quot;<p>
                Buttercup looked at Tracey and Sharon with a frown, as if she 
                were only just beginning to realise that the girls were not themselves 
                local. She examined their faces and smiled broadly at Tracey, 
                who still stood several metres back, perhaps aware of the curious 
                affect she was having on the girl. &quot;Can't you guess?&quot; 
                she asked. &quot;Isn't it obvious? Don't you know who, or what, 
                I am.&quot;<p>
                &quot;No,&quot; Sharon answered bluntly, looking up from the map. 
                After showing the map, she was more concerned by the fact that 
                although she knew that on the map they were in the green bit around 
                the purple bit, they had no idea how much of the green bit they 
                still had to walk through. She hoped it wasn't too much more.<p>
                &quot;We don't come from this country,&quot; offered Tracey as 
                a sort of explanation. &quot;We're tourists.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Really! I can't believe it! Are you really?&quot; asked 
                Buttercup, looking at Tracey's friend for confirmation. Sharon 
                nodded. &quot;I suppose it must be true if you say so. But what 
                you doing so far from the tourist resorts? At least, I didn't 
                think there were any tourist resorts near here.&quot;<p>
                Tracey spoke and was surprised by how cracked her voice was and 
                how thick it was with an emotion she didn't really understand. 
                &quot;We were on holiday in Throb. And we couldn't pay our bill. 
                So we done a bunk. And we've been walking to Gomorrah.&quot; <p>
                &quot;Even though there's a war?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Apparently, we stand a much better chance than by going 
                via the normal channels. And anyway there's only the sea or Sodom 
                to choose between otherwise.&quot;<p>
                &quot;No choice at all,&quot; admitted Buttercup. &quot;Unless 
                you're very good swimmers.&quot; <p>
                &quot;We've had a fucking awful time since we left Throb,&quot; 
                Sharon elaborated. &quot;It's been so fucking hard. We got beat 
                up by a fucking teacher. And we've had nothing decent to eat. 
                And we ain't even had any fucking ciggies. Buggery's a fucking 
                awful country. No fucking disrespect meant. It being your fucking 
                country and all. But it's one fucking shitty, pissing awful place. 
                There's been fucking nothing to recommend it to fucking anyone.&quot;<p>
                &quot;So you're fugitives,&quot; smiled Buttercup warmly as Tracey 
                nervously walked towards her. &quot;I'm a fugitive too, you know. 
                From the Royal Court. Well, not quite the Royal Court: but from 
                behind the Big Wall. I've just escaped.&quot;<p>
                &quot;How did you manage that?&quot;<p>
                &quot;It wasn't easy. But I used to make love with one of the 
                guards quite often and I managed to steal her keys. I had to kill 
                her, though. It wasn't pleasant and it certainly wasn't easy, 
                but when you've been behind the wall that's not so difficult. 
                There was so much blood though. She took so long to die! But she'd 
                have been killed anyway when they'd found I'd escaped. And I've 
                been free for two days now. No food. No people. Nothing. But free!&quot;<p>
                &quot;Was it so fucking awful behind the wall?&quot; wondered 
                Sharon. &quot;It's been so shitty on this side of the wall, we 
                just couldn't imagine it being worse on the other side.&quot;<p>
                &quot;It is hell! You just can't believe! And you foreigners probably 
                can't believe it anyway. I'd never believed it possible. Like 
                all my classmates I'd been brought up to believe in a much more 
                pleasant world than this. Like all the other girls in my school, 
                we'd been prepared as sacrificial virgins. We were taught how 
                to love, and never even knew that clothes ever existed. We watched 
                Buggery television: and as far as we knew that's what real life 
                was really like.&quot; <p>
