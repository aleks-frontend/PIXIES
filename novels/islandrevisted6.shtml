                &quot;Amy is a lot smarter than most people seemingly give her 
                credit for,&quot; Pamela said to me, as we sat together in our 
                personal suite. &quot;She's not a dumb porno slut. No one needed 
                to tell her that you have been spying on her and the others since 
                the summer with your hidden cameras and microphones. Amy pretty 
                much figured it out for herself.&quot;<p>
                Shifting about in my chair, I took a deep breath and eyed Pamela 
                intently. &quot;How could Amy figure it out for herself? That 
                would be near impossible.&quot;<p>
                &quot;She's a smart girl,&quot; Pamela reiterated. &quot;Let me 
                give you some hints she has picked up on. During the summer, Amy 
                and I came across that satellite you have stashed away on the 
                other side of the island. This was before I found out about the 
                voyeur room, myself. We were taking a nature walk and just came 
                across it, out of the blue. I didn't think much of it at the time, 
                but Amy openly questioned why you would have such a hi-tech satellite 
                on the island.&quot; Pamela paused and added, &quot;Of course, 
                I would later find out that all of your hidden camera feeds are 
                sent to that satellite, and then relayed to here - the voyeur 
                room.&quot;<p>
                &quot;That was the first clue,&quot; Pamela continued. &quot;The 
                second was last night, when you told her of your computer server 
                and its Internet capabilities. Then, you showed Amy that video 
                camera which you were going to use for her webcast. Later, she 
                asked me why in the world you would have such expensive equipment 
                on an isolated island like this... especially if you had no prior 
                intentions of using it.&quot; Pamela paused and said, &quot;I 
                kind of froze up for a minute, not knowing what to say. Then I 
                told her that I had no idea. I said you have lots of expensive 
                stuff here.&quot;<p>
                &quot;So, as Amy told me several hours ago... she simply put two 
                and two together. Satellite hidden away on a remote corner of 
                the island. Computer server, network. Video camera which probably 
                costs thousands of dollars. Why have all of this if you never 
                plan on using it?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Amy thought like I did during the summer - where were you 
                most of the time? When all of us were having fun and enjoying 
                each others' company, you were usually nowhere to be found. Then 
                the thought hit her. Was there a chance that you could have been 
                filming us the whole time?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Amy said earlier today, she looked around her room for about 
                an hour. She was about to give up, but then noticed the air conditioning 
                vent high on the wall. Amy got a chair and looked inside with 
                a flashlight.&quot; I gulped my throat at the realization as Pamela 
                went on, &quot;And she found one of your spy-cameras, all nice 
                and tucked away.&quot;<p>
                I didn't have the chance to speak with Amy yet about her knowledge 
                of the voyeur room. After the webcast ended an hour ago, she left 
                my suite... and I haven't seen her since. I was trying to pry 
                as much information as I could out of Pamela concerning the situation, 
                as she had spoken to Amy sometime before the webcast.<p>
                &quot;Amy was shocked at first. She couldn't believe that you 
                would spy on us, Jeremy.&quot; I frowned at those words. &quot;She 
                thought like I did, back during the summer when you told me about 
                the voyeur room. I thought you were sending pictures and videos 
                of us all over the Internet. I thought that was how you made your 
                money. And now, she thought that, too.&quot;<p>
                I paused before saying, &quot;Whenever I really start to think 
                about it, I do feel guilty. It's not right of me to spy on all 
                you girls. But I really can't help it.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I know, Jeremy,&quot; Pamela said. &quot;And I understand. 
                You know that I have never approved of the voyeur room myself, 
                though I do admit, at the same time, to being glad that it exists. 
                I like to watch, too, but still think it is wrong.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I look past that because now I know that you would never 
                do anything bad with our videos or pictures. You made that promise 
                to me during the summer, and have kept it. The videos and pictures 
                are for your own amusement, and nothing else. You have no desire 
                to sell them to anyone.&quot;<p>
                &quot;That WOULD be wrong,&quot; I said to her. &quot;And besides, 
                I don't need the money these images would generate. I just like 
                to sit back and watch others have sex. I'm a voyeur.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Amy was in a rage when I saw her earlier today, Jeremy,&quot; 
                Pamela said. &quot;You're lucky I came across her before you did. 
                She was really angry at you because she thought, with all your 
                sophisticated computer equipment, that every move us girls made 
                was being shown live over the Internet.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I was able to calm her down, and tell her otherwise. I basically 
                said the same things I said to you a minute ago. You use those 
                cameras for your own personal amusement, and nothing else. I kind 
                of equated it to a sickness of yours. You almost get as much pleasure 
                out of watching others have sex when compared to having sex yourself.&quot;<p>
                &quot;We went into a long talk,&quot; Pamela continued. &quot;Amy 
                said you have been such a good person to all of us. Never before 
                in her entire life had she met a man who was as nice, giving and 
                easy-going as you.&quot; I actually broke a smile at those words. 
                &quot;Without you, her alter ego - Aimee Embers - would not exist. 
                She would not be a millionaire porn star, nor would she be driving 
                around Los Angeles in an $80,000 car. Without you, Amy would be 
                waiting tables in Ohio... perhaps making eight bucks an hour - 
                if she was lucky.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Amy realized this, Jeremy, and understood it. I told her 
                that you would NEVER do anything to hurt ANY of us. I drilled 
                it into her over and over again that the voyeur room is for your 
                own enjoyment. No one but you, myself, Lindsay and Christina has 
                ever seen any of those tapes you have. They will never fall into 
                the wrong hands, either.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Amy agreed that you are too nice and sweet to us to do something 
                so sinister and rotten like that,&quot; she continued. &quot;While 
                Amy thought you videotaping us in our private time together was 
                pretty sinister and rotten itself, sharing the tapes with others 
                would be a million times worse.&quot; Pamela took a deep breath 
                and added, &quot;Then Amy said if the voyeur room was just for 
                you, me and Lindsay - and Christina before us - she could live 
                with it. She said as long as that is the case, she'll keep it 
                a secret.&quot; My eyes went wide as Pamela concluded, &quot;Amy 
                said that she LOVES being watched.&quot;<p>
                I took a sigh of relief as perhaps my greatest fear had apparently 
                been squashed. What happens if all of the ladies find out about 
                the voyeur room, and then turn on me?<p>
                I wanted them to trust me completely, though what I was doing 
                with the voyeur room was anything but trustworthy. At the same 
                time, though, the video and picture images would never fall into 
                the wrong hands, or on the open market.<p>
                I would safeguard that room and those tapes WITH MY LIFE if it 
                was necessary. That is how much these women and their privacy, 
                well-being and dignity meant to me.<p>
                &quot;Amy thought the best way to get you back for filming us 
                was to do what she did,&quot; Pamela said. &quot;And that was 
                to get you on film during her webcast, so the entire world could 
                see you buck-naked. It was pretty devilish on her part, but I 
                also thought it was a real good idea, too. You didn't ask to be 
                on camera, but neither did any of us. So we're even.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I understand that,&quot; I said in response. &quot;It really 
                does not matter, though. No one who knows me outside of the island's 
                inner circle will ever see that webcast. So, it's okay. I understand 
                why she did that, too.&quot;<p>
                &quot;There is a bit of bad news though, Jeremy,&quot; Pamela 
                said.<p>
                &quot;What is that?&quot; I asked, my eyebrows raised.<p>
                &quot;Amy destroyed that camera in the air conditioning vent,&quot;<p>
                Pamela replied, as my eyes narrowed. &quot;She was pretty mad 
                at the time, you know. Now, she regrets it, though. I told her 
                those cameras in the air vents cost you $55,000 each.&quot;<p>
                &quot;It's no big deal,&quot; I said, shrugging it off. &quot;I 
                have three of those cameras stored away in backup, in case one 
                failed or in this case, was destroyed.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You're not mad?&quot; Pamela asked, a bit surprised. &quot;I 
                know you have tons of money, Jeremy. As your wife, maybe I don't 
                even know how much you have - you're always so secretive about 
                things. But $55,000 is a lot of money.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I'm not mad, no,&quot; was my reply. &quot;Amy had every 
                right to destroy that camera. If it were me in that situation, 
                I most likely would have done the same thing.&quot; I paused and 
                said, &quot;And you know everything about my money, Pamela, because 
                I have told you about it. You're my wife. I don't hide a thing 
                from you, or even Lindsay, for that matter.&quot;<p>
                Pamela hesitated, then offered a smile. &quot;I guess now is a 
                good time to tell you, Jeremy, that we've been spied on for this 
                entire conversation.&quot; Pamela pointed toward the wall which 
                shielded the voyeur room and said, &quot;Amy wanted to see how 
                you would react to the conversation her and I had about you. I 
                let her in earlier, before calling you here to our suite.&quot; 
                She paused and added, &quot;I hope you're not mad.&quot;<p>
                Yes, I was mad. Why was Amy in the voyeur room right now, without 
                any supervision? She had no idea how to work the controls or cameras. 
                What happens if she somehow damaged my switchboard or the server?<p>
                I had every right to be mad at Pamela, because she had let someone 
                into MY voyeur room without MY consent.<p>
                But it has always taken quite a lot for me to show any outward 
                anger. &quot;I'm not mad, no,&quot; was my quiet response. It 
                is a very remarkable trait which I have.<p>
                Pamela smiled in relief. &quot;That's good. Amy said she wanted 
                to stay with you tonight, Jeremy. So I guess that means I'll be 
                staying with her room-mate, Stephanie.&quot; My wife grinned broadly 
                and added, &quot;She wants a lap dance.&quot;<p>
                That definitely sounded like a videotape which will need to be 
                reviewed in the future!<p>
                But then I remembered - there was no longer a hidden camera stashed 
                away in Amy and Stephanie's room. It had been destroyed by the 
                porno slut...</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>&quot;You're a good guy, Jeremy,&quot; Amy said to me moments 
                later, as we sat at the control panel in my voyeur room. Fortunately, 
                Amy claimed to have not touched anything in here. Pamela had set 
                everything up herself (thank God), so Amy could eavesdrop on our 
                prior discussion.<p>
                &quot;You're a good guy, and that's why I forgive you,&quot; she 
                added seconds later. &quot;I didn't think that way at first, though. 
                I was pretty hysterical when I found that camera.&quot; She smiled 
                and continued, &quot;But I understand that you like to watch others 
                have sex. One of my old boyfriends in Ohio really got off on watching 
                me have sex with others. You remind me of him a lot, Jeremy. A 
                whole lot.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Maybe it is a sickness on my part,&quot; I said, taking 
                a deep breath. &quot;I know it is wrong of me to spy on you and 
                all the other girls. But I can't help it. I can't fight it. One 
                of the major reasons why I brought all of you girls here in the 
                first place was so I could spy on you. It's wrong and I know it, 
                and many times I feel guilty.<p>
                But there is really nothing I can do about it, though.&quot;<p>
                &quot;It's okay, Jeremy,&quot; Amy said, reaching out and patting 
                my shoulder. &quot;Did you see the movie I starred in, where the 
                guy videotaped me and Torrie having sex together from his apartment 
                window?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I have ALL of your movies, dear,&quot; I responded.<p>
                Amy smiled and nodded her head. &quot;That's good. Well,<p>
                that guy was made out to be a real pervert in the movie. He videotaped 
                Torrie and me, and a whole bunch of other couples. He didn't have 
                sex at all during the movie. He just whacked off while spying 
                on others with his camera.&quot;<p>
                &quot;That sounds eerily familiar,&quot; I admitted, which made 
                Amy break out into a giggling fit.<p>
                &quot;It should!&quot; the red-head countered. &quot;Pamela told 
                me that you all do is sit in here and whack off, watching us girls 
                have sex with each other. The guy in the movie was a nasty pervert. 
                But you, Jeremy... you're a good pervert.&quot;<p>
                She paused and added, &quot;I would re-pay you for that camera 
                if it wasn't so expensive. $55,000 would be a major hit to me, 
                especially since a porn star's light can fade out at any moment. 
                I'm always looking toward the future.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I don't want your money,&quot; I told her. &quot;But if 
                you truly want to re-pay me... 55,000 blowjobs sounds real nice.&quot;<p>
                Amy giggled at those words. &quot;That's a lot of blowjobs!&quot;<p>
                &quot;The camera is meaningless to me,&quot; I said. &quot;As 
                I told<p>
                Pamela, I have three extras in storage. I can just stick one back 
                in your room, in the air vent, sometime tomorrow. That is, of 
                course, as long as you approve of it.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I have no problems,&quot; Amy returned. &quot;The more I 
                think about it, the more I like it. When it is time for all of 
                us to go home, I'd like to have some videotapes of me and Stephanie 
                together. I really like her, and she loves me. Rest assured that 
                those tapes will be viewed by only me.<p>
                That is the only stipulation I have for keeping quiet.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Is the rumor true,&quot; I said, &quot;that Stephanie wants 
                to get into porn with you and Torrie?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yes, it is,&quot; Amy replied. &quot;It's still very early 
                in the winter, of course. But Stephanie is seriously thinking 
                about it. She really likes the idea of being in the middle of 
                a big gang-bang, with a ton of men around to use her. That is 
                her ultimate fantasy, and of course, she could make a ton of movies 
                like that in porno.&quot;<p>
                Amy paused and said, &quot;Hey, speaking of that... doesn't Lindsay 
                turn 19 in a couple of days? I sure remember what happened during 
                the summer when one of us had a birthday...&quot;</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>As I sat in the mansion's library the following day, reading 
                a reference book, I heard a noise from the outer hallway. Looking 
                up, I then smiled at the beautiful sight of Stephanie as she stood 
                at the entranceway to the library. Decked out in a pair of denim 
                shorts and a white tank-top which was completely cut just below 
                her enormous breasts, the luscious brunette offered me a smile 
                in return.<p>
                &quot;Mind if I come in, Jeremy?&quot; was her soft question.<p>
                &quot;No,&quot; I said, placing the reference book upon a table.<p>
                &quot;Not at all. Please... by all means, come inside.&quot;<p>
                Stephanie smiled again as she sashayed into the library. Her tank-top 
                was a tad bit wet, and clung to her breasts accordingly. I could 
                also tell that she was not wearing a bra underneath the incredibly 
                thin, see-through fabric...<p>
                &quot;I just wanted to say how beautiful this island is,&quot; 
                Stephanie offered, before sitting down in a chair beside me. &quot;All 
                of the other girls have probably told you the very same thing... 
                so I'll just imagine that it's my turn now. I never dreamed the 
                island could be quite this beautiful.&quot;<p>
                &quot;That seems to be the prevailing opinion, yes,&quot; I told 
                her. &quot;Most of you are city girls, and have never been around 
                a place like this. That's why it blows your mind.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You can see tropical islands on television and in movies,&quot; 
                Stephanie commented. &quot;But you don't know how beautiful and 
                exotic they can be until actually being there in person. I can 
                definitely attest to that.&quot;<p>
                I smiled at the brunette, appreciating the sight of her big, swelling 
                breasts underneath that little tank-top. &quot;Why aren't you 
                with the other girls, dear?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Oh, I was,&quot; the 25-year-old giggled. &quot;We were 
                all down at the beach. I came back to get something to eat. Usually 
                I feel a bit hungry around mid-afternoon.&quot;<p>
                I smiled at her and said, &quot;I heard a rumor that you are considering 
                porn, with Amy and Torrie. Is that true?&quot;<p>
                Stephanie's face turned red as she replied, &quot;Yes, I am.<p>
                I have a good career, and I make a lot of money as a nurse. But 
                you know what? Porn just sounds so exciting. Maybe I could do 
                porn for a few years, then go back to nursing.&quot;<p>
                I could definitely imagine Stephanie as an X-rated star. She had 
                the maturity and demeanor for it, and definitely the body. That 
                body of hers could stop a freight train.<p>
                &quot;I admit that I have a lot of movies at home,&quot; the young 
                woman said. &quot;Amy said she could introduce me to all of my 
                favorite stars. Just imagining myself in one of those movies, 
                with so many gorgeous people... I get chills.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You told me on your island application long ago that collecting 
                porn movies is a hobby of yours,&quot; I said to her. &quot;We 
                have something in common, because I collect them, too. I must 
                say, though... the only ones I am interested in anymore are those 
                with Amy and/or Torrie in them.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Amy said you created her,&quot; Stephanie grinned. &quot;Without 
                you, there would be no Aimee Embers. She told me you helped her 
                discover her 'inner slut' during the summer. Amy is my most favorite 
                star, of course, so I want to thank you for that. She is the best 
                thing to happen to porn in years.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You sound like a very devoted fan, dear,&quot; I remarked. 
                &quot;I can only imagine the look on your face when you realized 
                that Aimee Embers was going to be with you on the island.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I was shocked,&quot; Stephanie grinned. &quot;Completely 
                shocked. Of all the women who could have been on the island, one 
                of them had to be my favorite celebrity. Dumb luck, I guess.&quot;<p>
                &quot;If you got into porn,&quot; I told her, &quot;I bet you 
                would become the favorite star for many fans, too.&quot;<p>
                Stephanie offered another smile and said, &quot;It's really not 
                official, yet. I still have to think about it. I know that being 
                a porn star is not the safest lifestyle. Torrie and Amy both have 
                bodyguards, you know.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yes, I know,&quot; was my response. &quot;They're on vacation 
                now, because Amy and Torrie are perfectly safe on the island.&quot; 
                I paused and added, &quot;Amy has two bodyguards, in fact.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I don't know if I'd like that myself,&quot; the brunette 
                said, her voice squeaking. &quot;That's what I have to decide. 
                Maybe I could do some webcasts for the Internet with Amy, and 
                call that my dream-come-true. It would be a lot more low-profile 
                for me than becoming a full-fledged porn star.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Whatever you decide, dear, you have my backing,&quot; I 
                told her. &quot;I'll help you out in whatever way I can.&quot;<p>
                The 25-year-old offered yet another smile, as well as a gentle 
                kiss upon my cheek. &quot;Thank you, Jeremy.&quot; She paused 
                before saying, &quot;So what is the deal with you? You have all 
                this money, this mansion... the island. You have a gorgeous wife 
                in Pamela, a playmate in Lindsay. Apparently bringing women to 
                the island is something you have done before, simply because you 
                can. What more do you want in life?&quot;<p>
                I shrugged my shoulders, lost in thought for a few seconds. &quot;I'd 
                like everyone to be happy. I want the world to be happy, for countries 
                to get along. There's too much garbage going on today, you know.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I think rational people want world peace,&quot; Stephanie 
                commented. &quot;But there are people out there who aren't rational. 
                You really can't do anything about them.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I know,&quot; was my response. &quot;But at least the people 
                in my life, I want them to be happy. I can make a difference there. 
                During the summer, two people who were here - Lisa and Christina, 
                I helped bring them together. Right now, they live in Illinois 
                and are very much in love together.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I heard a little bit about Lindsay and her girlfriend, Trish,&quot; 
                the vixen remarked. &quot;It sounded pretty sad - the reason they 
                broke up. I guess next to you and Pamela, they were THE couple 
                during the summer.&quot;<p>
                I nodded my head and returned, &quot;Yes, indeed. I still wish 
                both of them were together. They belong together.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Is there anything else which you want in life?&quot; she 
                asked me. &quot;You must want something for yourself.&quot;<p>
                How about Devon? .....<p>
                &quot;I can't really think of something now, dear,&quot; was my 
                answer, as I did not want to show any outward favoritism for a 
                newcomer to the island. &quot;Pamela and Lindsay make me very, 
                very happy. Although it may be human nature to want more, I really 
                can't ask for it. I have much more than I deserve.&quot;</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>&quot;I'm glad that everything was smoothed over between you 
                and Amy,&quot; Pamela said, as her and I cuddled together upon 
                a lounge chair, on the deck just outside our personal suite. It 
                was 9:00pm, and both of us had been gazing at the night sky for 
                the past several moments while in conversation.<p>
                &quot;Amy has always meant a lot to me,&quot; I said, kissing 
                the crown of Pamela's head. &quot;The last thing I want is for 
                her to be mad at me. No one is more glad that everything is okay 
                between us than I am. Trust me on that.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Lindsay turns 19 tomorrow,&quot; my wife commented. &quot;Is 
                the big gang-bang still in order? We had such a wonderful time 
                this past summer when Amy and Torrie had birthdays. All those 
                guys you brought in... it was so great.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Of course the gang-bang is in order,&quot; I told her. &quot;The 
                guys will all be arriving via boat tomorrow morning.&quot; I smiled 
                and added, &quot;You girls will be quite busy tomorrow.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I can't wait!&quot; Pamela squealed with a grin. &quot;I 
                haven't been triple-fucked by a group of guys since our honeymoon. 
                Do you remember those guys Lindsay and I met, in Cabo?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Of course,&quot; I moaned, my eyes flashing. &quot;How in 
                the world could I ever forget that night? You and Lindsay gave 
                those guys the best sex of their entire lives.&quot;<p>
                &quot;And you watched every minute,&quot; Pamela said, smiling. 
                &quot;You really are a voyeur, Jeremy. Not many men would enjoy 
                watching their wife get drilled on their honeymoon. But you, Jeremy... 
                you really GOT OFF from it. Didn't you?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yes, I did,&quot; I told her. &quot;And why not? You and 
                Lindsay enjoyed yourselves. I was happy, to see you two happy.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Speaking of things which make people happy, I know that 
                Devon makes YOU happy, Jeremy,&quot; the 25-year-old said to me. 
                &quot;What do you think of the other two newbies... Cassidy and 
                Stephanie? Or do you have an opinion yet?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Stephanie is a good person,&quot; I replied. &quot;I really 
                hope that she does not get into porn, because she has such a good 
                career going right now in nursing. She said she could do porn 
                for a few years and then get back into nursing. I'm not sure how 
                many hospitals would want a former porn star employed for them 
                as a nurse.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Let me guess...&quot; Pamela said. &quot;You don't want 
                her to get into porn, yet you won't tell her that? You did the 
                same with Lindsay during the summer when she was about to side 
                with Amy, until Trish forced you to get involved.&quot;<p>
                &quot;If Stephanie wants to try porn, I'll support her in whatever 
                way I can,&quot; I said. &quot;It's her decision. I don't want 
                to tell the girls how to live their lives.&quot;<p>
                &quot;What happens if she asks for your advice?&quot; Pamela said.<p>
                &quot;I mean, Jeremy... you're just so easy to talk to.&quot;<p>
                I smiled and responded, &quot;If she asks for my advice, I will 
                give it to her. And that advice would be for her to do whatever 
                makes her happy. It's not my place to decide or influence what 
                Stephanie does with her life.&quot;<p>
                I paused before saying, &quot;As for Cassidy... aside from that 
                gang-bang the other night, where you girls got me, I haven't had 
                much interaction with her. So, no real opinion yet. I will say 
                that Cassidy is beautiful, and seems friendly. But... no real 
                opinion.&quot;<p>
                &quot;She and Devon seem to be getting along pretty good,&quot; 
                Pamela said. &quot;Lindsay really likes Cassidy, too.&quot;</p>
              <p> * * *</p>
              <p>Just then, a series of loud knocks were heard upon the main door 
                to our personal suite. Turning in the lounge chair, Pamela and 
                I glanced inside the suite, then looked at each other. &quot;I'll 
                get it,&quot; I said, nudging the stacked blonde out of my lap. 
                I stood up and stretched my back for a moment, then ventured into 
                the suite and to the door.<p>
                &quot;Hi Amy,&quot; I said upon opening the door, smiling at the 
                red-headed vision of loveliness (and nastiness). &quot;What brings 
                you here, this time of night?&quot;<p>
                Without a word, Amy bristled past me into the suite, and soon 
                Pamela strolled in from the outside deck. I was confused for a 
                moment, then felt curious about the sheet of paper which Amy held 
                in her hand.<p>
                &quot;I was checking my e-mail on the computer downstairs, and 
                came across one I thought you would like, Jeremy,&quot; Amy said. 
                &quot;I got over 500 e-mails in response to last night's show, 
                most of which were very positive. But this one stood out...&quot; 
                Amy extended the piece of paper, and I took it from her.<p>
                An e-mail that stood out? Hmmmmmm... perhaps it was from Trish, 
                wanting to be reunited with Lindsay!<p>
                As I held the paper out in front of me, in preparation to read 
                it, Pamela peered over my shoulder and eyed the note.</p>
              <p>Dear Aimee,<p>
                Hi! My name is Vicky and I'm a really big fan of your work, and 
                your website. I loved your live show last night, but am writing 
                in regards to the man who was in it at the end. I may be crazy, 
                but was that Jeremy (my last name)? I didn't get a real good view, 
                but it sure looked like him. You see, he and I were once engaged.<p>
                I know you're a busy gal with your career and all, but if you 
                could write back and just let me know, I would appreciate it. 
                Jeremy and I were real close, and I regret the fact that we're 
                no longer together.<p>
                Please respond! -Vicky :)</p>
              <p>&quot;Victoria...&quot; I sighed, my eyes wide and flashing.<p>
                &quot;Former fiancee?&quot; Pamela said to me, her tone uneven.<p>
                I could already tell that my wife was feeling a bit jealous, and 
                guarded. She wasn't the jealous type, but this was definitely 
                a reasonable exception for it.<p>
                &quot;I haven't seen or heard from Victoria in eight years,&quot; 
                I said. &quot;I... it's... it's unbelievable. She... she found 
                me through Amy's website.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Eight years?&quot; Pamela commented. &quot;You were 19 then.<p>
                Was this Vicky or Victoria a high school flame, too?&quot;<p>
                &quot;You... you could say that,&quot; was my response, as pain 
                once thought put away for good swirled throughout my body. &quot;She... 
                she left me standing... at the altar...&quot;<p>
                &quot;Oh my...&quot; Pamela said, her voice changing to a more 
                caring tone, as she placed a hand upon my shoulder.<p>
                &quot;But Pamela is your wife now,&quot; Amy said, stepping forward 
                and clutching my wrist. &quot;You love her, she loves you.&quot;<p>
                No matter how perfect you consider your relationship to be with 
                your spouse - as I do with Pamela - being contacted by another 
                person you were about to marry after eight years of silence... 
                it can play tricks with your mind.<p>
                The many thoughts and emotions which were, just seconds ago, compressed 
                and put away for good... they were now back, and stronger than 
                ever. My expression and body language most definitely conveyed 
                this message to Pamela and Amy.<p>
                &quot;Are you okay, Jeremy?&quot; my beloved wife asked.<p>
                &quot;Yeah... I'll... I'll be fine,&quot; was my response. &quot;I... 
                I<p>
                just need a minute here to think about this.&quot;<p>
                &quot;What should I say to Vicky in e-mail?&quot; Amy asked us.<p>
                &quot;Should I tell her it was really you, Jeremy? Or not?&quot;</p>
              <p>&lt;&lt;&lt;- End of Part 6 -&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
