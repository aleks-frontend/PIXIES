                In Which Dodie rediscovers Innocence; and Innocence acquires a 
                new fame from past endeavours.
              <p>Dodie had been away from Wonderground for so long on her travels 
                which had taken her as far as her stamina and savings allowed 
                her. She had seen so many different countries and districts, and 
                had met so many different people. And frequently made love to 
                them. She'd accumulated possessions and had them stolen. She'd 
                lain for days in foreign hospitals and frequently been so intoxicated 
                or drugged up that she'd lost all knowledge and recollection of 
                normal time and space. But in all her wanderings, one of the moments 
                she'd treasured most was the occasion when she had sex with Innocence 
                on the glacier. Such a perfect location! And Innocence such a 
                mistress of the art of sex! Dodie had come and come and come again 
                - her cries of passion bouncing off the mountains and threatening 
                to set off avalanches. In fact, so impressed was she by her moment 
                of passion that before the last drop of Innocence's semen dripped 
                out of her vagina, she went to a tattooist to have the name Innocence 
                embellished on her left buttock.<p>
                So when she heard that Innocence was living in Wonderground, Dodie 
                headed to the address she'd been given expecting to meet her and 
                also Mouse, who she'd heard was Innocence's current lover (The 
                lucky girl!). She rang the doorbell and stood nervously in the 
                porch in a padded nylon jacket and huge trainers. Otherwise she 
                wore nothing at all, except a paraphernalia of studs and rings 
                piercing her body and skin at various points, and with a head 
                which unlike her crotch or underarms was completely shaved bare. 
                At last, the door opened and she saw a slightly startled Innocence 
                who was dressed in only a silk dressing gown.<p>
                &quot;Hi!&quot; Dodie announced herself as self-confidently as 
                possible. &quot;I'm back home!&quot;<p>
                Innocence looked at Dodie a little blearily. Although it was mid-afternoon, 
                she'd clearly just been asleep, and finding it a little difficult 
                to focus her eyes. Dodie was relieved to find that she remembered 
                her after all these months. Perhaps our lovemaking had been as 
                memorable for her as it was for me, Dodie hoped. <p>
                &quot;O hello, Dodie!&quot; Innocence said with a warm and welcoming 
                smile. &quot;You better come in!&quot;<p>
                Dodie's heart began beating uncontrollably as she followed the 
                beautiful Innocence into the living room where she was introduced 
                to Kedi and Chastity who were eating dinner and listening to a 
                compact disc. Kedi was wearing nothing as usual and actually recognised 
                Dodie from several years before. Chastity was wearing a very tight 
                dress which fit as tight against her body as a dress could do, 
                but was too short to cover her shaven vagina. Her hair was straight 
                with a geometric cut and fell just short of her shoulders. <p>
                &quot;So, where've you been?&quot; asked Kedi, whose English had 
                clearly improved a great deal over the years. &quot;Mouse told 
                me that you were travelling the world.&quot;<p>
                &quot;As much of the world as I could manage,&quot; admitted Dodie, 
                aware that her travels had been with substantially less purpose 
                and direction than even that description gave. She was carrying 
                a heavy rucksack on her back and a plastic bag, and was pleased 
                to divest herself of these and leave them in the hallway. She 
                was surprised by the relative luxury of the girls' home. She imagined 
                that it would be much the same as the homes she used to live in, 
                with overflowing ashtrays, scattered empty wine bottles and clothes 
                scattered about. Here was somewhat considerable comfort, with 
                tasteful fittings and sumptuous thick pile carpets and new simple 
                and commodious furniture. There were stereos, computers, videos, 
                microwaves and everything. This was clearly not a place of poverty. 
                She felt a little nervous as she took off her padded jacket, under 
                which she was wearing a sleeveless singlet that barely pretended 
                to hide her tiny little breasts. The house didn't have the smell 
                she'd become so accustomed to: of unflushed toilets, unscrubbed 
                beer-stained linoleum and hashish-stained wallpaper.<p>
                However, her feeling of feeling an inferior outsider diminished 
                as she began recounting her exploits across the continents, the 
                people she'd met, the cultures she'd observed and her more amusing 
                adventures. &quot;It's a real fucking weird world out there!&quot; 
                she exclaimed, scratching the long hairs of her crotch. &quot;It's 
                all fucking weird shit, the lot of it.&quot; She then produced 
                a half pound of best hashish, from which she crumbled a few grains 
                into cigarette papers and disinterred cigarettes, and with this 
                stimulus and several bottles of wine, the conversation continued 
                for several more hours and Dodie didn't find herself exhausting 
                her supply of anecdotes or opinions.<p>
                She discussed her sexual encounters with shepherds in the distant 
                mountains of the equator and their curious predilection for making 
                love to sheep, which took on almost a religious significance. 
                She discussed the unsavoury political character of dictatorships 
                that severely limited freedom of speech, despite appearing so 
                liberal in other respects - particularly with regard to sex and 
                drugs. She talked about the way she suffered sexual and racial 
                taunts, and the more frequent times when her appearance had clashed 
                with the attitudes of authority. She talked of the drugs she'd 
                taken. The sex she'd had. The times she'd been beaten, had stuff 
                stolen, intimately searched by border patrols, been sick. The 
                religions, ideologies and wars she'd found out about. The so many 
                ways she felt her horizons had been uneradicably altered by her 
                experiences. &quot;I wouldn't have had one slightest change to 
                all that's happened to me!&quot; she boasted, knowing this to 
                be quite different to what she felt on innumerable occasions.<p>
                It was inevitable that Dodie and Innocence should end up fucking, 
                which they started doing before Kedi or Chastity had retired to 
                their own beds. The lovemaking was all that Dodie remembered and 
                more. And in the midst of it Dodie confessed the strength of her 
                affection for Innocence, how she never wanted to be parted from 
                her, how she thought about her every day, how she had been so 
                impressed as to get a tattoo to celebrate her love. She held Innocence 
                close to her body - she didn't want an inch of space between them 
                - and cried unaccustomed tears of joy at the thought of staying 
                with her and making love with her again and again.<p>
                Innocence was clearly both flattered and a little put out by Dodie's 
                protestations of love, but she appeared to have no objection to 
                having Dodie share her bed for the conceivable future. She clearly 
                enjoyed Dodie's devotion to her penis which she would hold and 
                put again and again into her mouth or vagina, to stimulate it 
                when it was not aroused and to satisfy it when it was. Dodie had 
                the feeling that Innocence was carrying the weight of some unhappiness 
                around with her, but she wasn't at all sure why.<p>
                At first she thought it was to do with Mouse's departure to follow 
                her career, but she came to realise that their love had never 
                been particularly exclusive. She wondered if the departure of 
                Null, who had provided the means for the girls' luxury, might 
                be the cause. But that didn't seem to be the full reason for her 
                sadness, either. There was clearly something that Innocence wanted 
                in life which just living with her sister and her sister's lover 
                in comfort and relative luxury didn't fully satisfy. Dodie hoped 
                that her arrival as Innocence's new lover might in some way bring 
                more joy into Innocence's life, but that somehow didn't seem the 
                whole solution.<p>
                Dodie's stated opinions for Innocence's dissatisfaction narrowed 
                on her ambiguous status as a woman with a penis - and how her 
                sexual identity was compromised and its socio-political and socio-economic 
                significances thereof. She argued long and hard that what Innocence 
                manifested was the unease of sexuality in a tightly sexual stereotyped 
                society. Dodie's inner feelings, however, were that these stated 
                reasons reflected more her own character and attitudes and probably 
                not a great deal of Innocence's.<p>
                Innocence was quite excited when the film Forbidden Love, - as 
                was entitled the film she'd been filmed in while she'd been living 
                in Brook, - was finally released, and she was able to go with 
                Dodie to see it in the cinema. It seemed to her that almost all 
                the film footage that had been taken of her and certainly all 
                her modest dialogue had been included in the final cut, and she 
                appeared more prominently in the film cast listing than she'd 
                expected. Indeed, a picture of her was even included in the poster, 
                with her penis fully erect, which it had never been in the filming. 
                Dodie was pleased for her lover, who seemed much more excited 
                by her modest film success than she'd ever expected.<p>
                Innocence was even more thrilled when she got a phone call from 
                a small circulation magazine, Fuck Films Today, asking to interview 
                her to which she unhesitatingly agreed. The whole idea of fame 
                clearly gave her considerable satisfaction, even though it was 
                a magazine Dodie had never heard of, and neither had the other 
                girls. Dodie bought a copy for Innocence to read, which was more 
                difficult than she'd anticipated as most newsagents hadn't heard 
                of the magazine either. It was a rather cheaply produced magazine 
                on not particularly good quality paper, and featured long articles 
                about obscure fuck films, with pictures of the stars. However, 
                this didn't trouble Innocence who eagerly looked for photographs 
                of the unlikely named Nancy Titbits, who was the woman who had 
                phoned her up and was going to interview her. <p>
                Nancy looked just like her photographs when she appeared at Innocence's 
                flat with Paul, the photographer, and all their recording and 
                film equipment. She had short cropped hair, was almost painfully 
                thin with a tiny nose in a round face, wearing a baggy tee-shirt 
                emblazoned with the magazine's name and a very brief pair of shorts. 
                The photographer wore very baggy and bedraggled trousers and jumper, 
                and long hair that fell over his face and didn't appear to have 
                been washed for several days.<p>
                &quot;Where shall we conduct the interview?&quot; Nancy wondered 
                as they were let in, clearly impressed by the luxury of the flat. 
                Innocence was dressed in a long sleeveless silk dress with a split 
                in the side which travelled from her ankles to very nearly her 
                armpit and under which she wore nothing else at all. <p>
                &quot;Anywhere you like!&quot; Innocence answered. &quot;As long 
                as Dodie can watch.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Of course she can!&quot; Nancy said, settling for the girls' 
                living room. &quot;I take it she's your lover!&quot;<p>
                &quot;You could say that,&quot; smiled Dodie who was dressed for 
                the occasion in just her singlet and wore a back-to-front baseball 
                cap over her shaved head.<p>
                While Paul was setting up the equipment, Nancy explained what 
                the interview would involve. Most of it would consist of a question 
                and answer session, which would comprise the text of the interview. 
                Then Innocence and Dodie would be filmed together, either posing 
                or, preferably, also having sex. Finally, it would be desirable 
                if Innocence could have sex with her, so that she could legitimately 
                include comments in the article of Innocence's sexual skills. 
                This would also be photographed, to provide evidence of the truth 
                of Nancy's assertions. &quot;It's expected by our readers that 
                the interviewers should make love with the interviewees. For many 
                of them it is the main reason they read our magazine.&quot;<p>
                Dodie and Innocence had read Fuck Films Today with enough attention 
                to be aware of this requirement. Most of the photographs of Nancy 
                in the magazine had featured her being fucked by a male porn star 
                who had a minor r&ocirc;le in films where his substantial bulk 
                was desirable. His penis was of quite normal dimensions, but Nancy 
                had done her best to suggest that it gave considerable satisfaction.<p>
                Nancy settled down on a sofa next to Innocence and turned on her 
                cassette recorder. She started asking questions while Paul fussed 
                around taking photographs of the two from several different positions. 
                The questions she asked were appropriate for an unknown fuck film 
                star, about whom nothing previously was known. These were to do 
                with her childhood, why she'd chosen a career in fuck cinema and 
                where she thought her career would take her. She asked very many 
                more questions about her penis: whether it was genuine, if she'd 
                had it all her life, what shortcomings and advantages there were 
                to being a beautiful woman so unusually blessed, and what her 
                sexual preferences and predilections were. At this point, Innocence 
                was asked by Paul to show her limp penis to the camera for him 
                to photograph, which she did by pushing her skirt to one side 
                over her wide-spread legs.<p>
                In all this questioning, Dodie noticed, Innocence answered fully 
                and without too much embarrassment, being clearly delighted in 
                her relative importance as the subject of the interview. It seemed 
                to Dodie that Innocence was happier and more relaxed than she'd 
                ever seen her before. Stardom and fame undoubtedly suited her. 
                Dodie had never been filmed having sex before - and neither, she 
                discovered, had Innocence - but it wasn't without enthusiasm that 
                the two divested themselves of clothes when the question and answer 
                session was completed and after posing for a few moments for a 
                few photographs started making love together.<p>
                Dodie reflected as Innocence's erect penis entered her bejewelled 
                vagina that after having had sex so publicly without a camera 
                recording what they were doing, there really was no difference 
                now - but Innocence appeared to have a better feel of what was 
                expected of them by positioning her genitals as prominently as 
                possible. It seemed to Dodie that her lover was actually enjoying 
                the sex rather more in that it was being recorded for posterity 
                than she did normally. Her gasps of ecstasy were notably more 
                frighteningly full-throated than usual. And when Dodie was sensing 
                through the repeated series of orgasms that were racking her slender 
                body that Innocence was just about to ejaculate, she untypically 
                withdrew her penis from inside her, pushed Dodie slightly off 
                her and ejaculated her prodigious semen over Dodie's tiny breasts 
                and onto her face. <p>
                Dodie licked the semen from off her face, looking at her lover 
                who was sitting astride her with a hand on her erect penis squeezing 
                out the last drops of semen that spurted beyond her and onto the 
                already slightly stained upholstery. Her eyes were squeezed close 
                in inexpressible ecstasy and her full large-nippled breasts were 
                heaving with her chest as her body shuddered with joy. Her other 
                hand held Dodie down beneath her, gently massaging one of Dodie's 
                prominent nipples.<p>
                The next thing Dodie knew she was redundant as Innocence and the 
                now naked Nancy, whose breasts were nearly as small as Dodie's, 
                had replaced her and the two were fucking together with incredible, 
                almost theatrical, abandon. Dodie felt jealous of the pair's lovemaking 
                - a feeling she'd had whenever she watched Innocence with Kedi 
                or her sister - despite her knowledge that in the same situation 
                she'd behave in exactly the same way. She felt particularly frustrated 
                in the knowledge that her episode of filmed sex was over, and 
                that Innocence wouldn't appreciate it at all if her interviewer 
                confused her lovemaking with the fresh young film star with that 
                with her lover. Nancy and Innocence continued making love for 
                quite a while, involving all orifices - including Innocence's 
                own anus which Nancy entered with a dildo she had handed to her 
                and strapped on by Paul. <p>
                The photographer continued snapping away. He paused during the 
                more prolonged sessions of continued passion, and then switched 
                into action whenever the two altered their routine to enter a 
                new position or when a new orifice was explored. He was clearly 
                quite excited by the action himself, as Dodie could see by focusing 
                her eyes on the swelling in Paul's trousers, but made no attempt 
                to contribute to the action himself.<p>
                Eventually, after Innocence had released copious amounts of semen 
                over Nancy's breasts, buttocks and face, the two collapsed in 
                an exhausted, wasted state on the carpet with Nancy reflectively 
                stroking Innocence's now flaccid penis. Paul continued to snap 
                pictures, and included amongst them those of still damp and unmistakable 
                stains on the carpet and elsewhere.<p>
                &quot;I think that will be quite sufficient!&quot; announced a 
                flushed Nancy, standing up and slipping on her tee-shirt. She 
                was clearly quite flustered because she initially pulled it over 
                her back-to-front with the logo of an erect penis and the slogan 
                Films to Fuck to at the front rather than at the back. She squeezed 
                her slender hips into her shorts with some difficulty and then 
                kissed Innocence with some passion on the lips.<p>
                The interviewers left in a state of some disarray, but gave precise 
                details of how many pages the interview would occupy - which was 
                about ten including a centre-fold and several full-page pictures 
                - and the date of the edition in which the interview would appear.<p>
                &quot;It'll be front-page material!&quot; Nancy promised. &quot;We'll 
                give you good copy - you don't have to worry. Fuck Films Today 
                will do its best to promote your career.&quot; <p>
                These kind words gave Innocence quite obvious satisfaction, which 
                she expressed more greatly in the passionate lovemaking she and 
                Dodie indulged in not long after the interviewers had gone.<p>
