              <p>These ceremonies rarely continued for much more than half an 
                hour, and then, sated and somehow purified, and with expressions 
                of beatific ecstasy, the pilgrims continued as before in the more 
                mundane businesses of preparing food, hunting and gathering food, 
                and, if they were already on their route, walking through the 
                barren Buggery countryside.<p>
                At night, Sharon rested against Sweetness, too weak from walking 
                and her tribulations of the previous days, to complain as Sweetness 
                showered her with affectionate kisses and cuddles. Indeed, she 
                only complained when Sweetness' fingers or tongue wandered towards 
                her arse or cunt, on which occasions, she would forcefully remind 
                the blind girl that she was not a fucking dyke. Sweetness seemed 
                resigned to Sharon's frequent rejection of her advances, but this 
                did not stop her from declaring, much to Sharon's embarrassment, 
                that she was in love with her and would do anything she wanted. 
                She noticed that Sweetness' affection for her was observed indulgently 
                by the Sodomite pilgrims, as they lay apart from the two girls, 
                gathered in a body of intertwined, intermingling flesh, chains 
                and naked skin.<p>
                The days were spent in wandering: something which Sharon had become 
                so accustomed to now that she no longer thought to complain even 
                to herself. This wandering was the purpose of the pilgrims' visit 
                to Buggery, and the effort of it was a small price to pay for 
                the food, water and protection the pilgrims provided. At irregular 
                intervals, sometimes two or three times in a day, and sometimes 
                only once in a day, the pilgrims would arrive at a place of some 
                religious significance to them. Sometimes it was obvious what 
                the object of their worship was. A tomb or a statue or a desecrated, 
                disused shrine. Sometimes it was much more obscure. An old tree, 
                the centre of a field of beetroots, a house lived in by puzzled 
                Buggery subjects. At whichever place it was, the pilgrims would 
                prostrate themselves, arse high in the air, their arms stretched 
                out in front of them whilst one of them would intone in a voice 
                made unintelligible by the loss of tongue. And then, after leaving 
                some tokens of worship, like a bunch of thistles, a coin or a 
                chain, the pilgrims would continue on their way. Sharon was never 
                sure what she should do in these ceremonies, but she reasoned 
                that whenever anyone from Buggery was watching, especially if 
                they were police, it was best to follow the example set by the 
                others and to instruct Sweetness to do the same. It amused her 
                in a grim kind of way to see the obvious discomfort of people 
                from Buggery at the pilgrims' presence. They rarely came very 
                close, but they would watch the strange ritual with fascination.<p>
                On only one occasion did anyone from Buggery take advantage of 
                the offer of abuse that the pilgrims made to everyone they met. 
                Two policewomen with erect dildos and muscled bodies pushed into 
                the pilgrims, kicking and punching them. But the fact that the 
                pilgrims were taking the punishment with such apparent pleasure, 
                asking for more with each punch or kick, clearly upset even them, 
                and they gave up after hardly any time at all. The pilgrims themselves 
                seemed quite gratified by the abuse that they had received and 
                soon meted out even worse punishment on each other in an flailing 
                orgy of nettles and brambles. <p>
                That evening, the pilgrims were still quite excited by their brief 
                encounter, proudly feeling the bruises raised on their faces and 
                limbs, and gently kissing the scratches which they had sustained. 
                Their ritual sodomy lasted longer than usual, while Sharon comforted 
                Sweetness who was clearly frightened by what she could hear but 
                could not see. And then the ritual became a softer, more sensual 
                and gentle lovemaking as the pilgrims entangled bodies became 
                engulfed in more conventional caresses and kisses: tongues and 
                fingers exercised on mutilated genitals and tongueless mouths. 
                The man seemed as keen on the sensuality as much as the girls, 
                despite his emasculation and the inability of his penis to become 
                erect or functional.<p>
                The girl who had first befriended them noticed Sharon and Sweetness 
                huddled together in the shade of the tree in the darkening shadows 
                of night. She wandered over to them, crouched down and smiled. 
                Wreathed in a rather becoming grin she attempted to say something 
                which Sharon strained to understand. It was hopeless, however. 
                Without a tongue, her words were just inarticulate noises and 
                her hand gestures were too intricate and involved for Sharon to 
                make any sense of them. Then the girl knelt down, put a hand on 
                Sharon's crotch and the other on Sweetness, and gestured with 
                a jerk of her neck that she was inviting the two girls to join 
                in the pilgrims' lovemaking.<p>
                Sharon had by now lost her fear of the pilgrims. They had not 
                even once attempted to persuade or coerce either of the girls 
                to join in their perverted rituals, and had made clear by their 
                actions that they had no expectation that they should do so. It 
                was sex and not physical abuse and humiliation that the girl was 
                offering them; but however relatively benign such lovemaking was 
                in comparison, it was still not something that Sharon could entertain. 
                &quot;I'm no fucking dyke!&quot; she replied, but relatively good-humouredly. 
                She was almost flattered by this extension of a hand of friendship, 
                but her days of abuse in the soldier's camp still left her scarred 
                and the thought of sex, even with a man, was not something that 
                attracted her. &quot;But Sweetness here&#133;&quot;<p>
                Sharon put a hand on her blind companion's shoulder. &quot;Our 
                Sodomite friend wants to know if you want to &#133; well, not 
                fuck exactly &#133; but, you know, have sex&#133;&quot; She glanced 
                up at the Sodomite's smiling, kindly face. &quot;It's not going 
                to involve arse-fucking or fucking whipping or all that shit, 
                is it? I don't want Sweetness, you know, hurt or any kind of fucking 
                shit you lot sort of do &#133; It's normal sex, isn't it?&quot;<p>
                The Sodomite girl smiled broadly, and shook her head to assure 
                Sharon.<p>
                &quot;What do you think, Sweetness?&quot; asked Sharon, aware 
                of the girls' own sexual needs and hoping that if it was spent 
                on the Sodomites it would no longer be focused on her.<p>
                Sweetness smiled at Sharon. &quot;You don't mind?&quot;<p>
                &quot;No, of course I fucking don't!&quot;<p>
                Sweetness stood up, and allowed herself to be led away by the 
                Sodomite. She turned back her head and smiled in a direction somewhat 
                to the left and ahead of where Sharon actually sat. &quot;Don't 
                forget. It's you that I love!&quot;<p>
                Sharon settled back, feeling happier if Sweetness were happy, 
                and felt good in herself as she watched Sweetness enter the mass 
                of pale shaven flesh of orgying Sodomites. She smiled with pleasure 
                as Sweetness gasped with pleasure. She wrapped her arms around 
                her chain-ridden breast and observed with satisfaction as Sweetness 
                was satisfied. She was so obviously enjoying the lips and fingers 
                exploring her vagina, the kisses on her face and breasts, the 
                feel of three or more bodies surrounding her. She yelped and gasped 
                and grunted, her body shining with a glint of perspiration in 
                the moonlight, as she was engulfed in the mass of flesh, lip and 
                chains, both her nipples chewed on, her clitoris afire with the 
                attention of two pairs of lips and discreetly applied fingers. 
                Her cries of joy and ecstasy at first echoing across the fields 
                from the copse where the pilgrims were resting, and then gradually 
                subsided as her energy and those of her lovers diminished and 
                the caresses became less passionate and more languid. <p>
                But even after all that, it was to Sharon's arms that Sweetness 
                eventually returned, her flesh sweaty and smelly, her vagina sore 
                and plastered with her vaginal fluids, and in whose same arms 
                that she stayed all night. &quot;I love you, Sharon,&quot; she 
                whispered, her shaven head against her ward's bechained bosom. 
                &quot;You are my perfect lover.&quot;<p>
                XVI
              <p>The sun hadn't yet arisen when Tracey and Buttercup were woken 
                by Zeta, who was naked like everyone else, slightly podgy with 
                a mass of black curly hair which flowed in ringlets to half-way 
                down her back. She stood at the doorway with a very broad grin 
                looking at the two girls whose only source of warmth through the 
                night had been from each other's closely entwined body. <p>
                &quot;We have to start early if we have any hope of getting into 
                the factory,&quot; she explained as she hurried them on their 
                way.<p>
                &quot;Where is the factory?&quot; wondered Tracey, yawning and 
                only half aware, as they staggered across the dark fields.<p>
                &quot;Another couple of miles. It's good that it's not been raining 
                for a while: that can make the journey quite horrible,&quot; replied 
                Zeta. &quot;You'll get used to it, though. But if you get there 
                too late then you've got no choice. It's first come first served 
                most of the time.&quot;<p>
                Eventually, just as the first rays of the sun appeared over the 
                horizon, they came to the intimidating dark shadows of a large 
                functional building, where only one or two windows were lit and 
                where already there were a couple of dozen other women: all naked 
                and all with very long hair and all standing around outside the 
                building. And then Tracey and Buttercup stood with Zeta for about 
                an hour as more and more women gathered. There was very little 
                conversation amongst the women standing there, all of them tired 
                and many of them yawning. Tracey shivered and clung to Buttercup 
                for warmth, aware of the stares she was attracting. As wakefulness 
                crept up on her, she became aware that this was because the two 
                girls looked very different from the others, with the short hair 
                on their vaginas: nearly none at all in Buttercup's case, and 
                in Tracey's case with the hair on her head strikingly short.<p>
                And then the doors to the factory opened and a man in overalls 
                and a flat cap emerged from the light inside to the shortening 
                shadows outside. He stood warily by the entrance, until he was 
                joined by three other men, wearing blue work uniforms and peaked 
                cloth hats. <p>
                &quot;Let's be having you, then!&quot; one of the men shouted, 
                which was a cue for the women to gather in an orderly procession 
                at the factory doors' entrance and to file in. As they did so, 
                they were evaluated in a desultory fashion by the men who clearly 
                saw this as a routine rather than a pleasure. Some women were 
                greeted with familiarity and some were turned away. These, Tracey 
                noticed, were generally the older women.<p>
                As the queue brought Zeta, Tracey and Buttercup towards the welcoming 
                bright glare of the neon lit interior, the men could see the girls 
                more clearly.<p>
                &quot;Fuck! You're a fucking beauty, ain't you?&quot; a corpulent 
                man with a cigarette in his hand commented to Buttercup. &quot;You 
                wanna fuck rather than work like the others, dearie?&quot;<p>
                Buttercup shook her head, and hurried after Zeta as she went in. 
                Tracey was aware of a disapproving glare at her shorter hair as 
                she entered herself, and was frightened that this might disqualify 
                her; but fortunately not and she soon caught up with Zeta and 
                Buttercup.<p>
                And then the girls were lined up by a conveyer belt under the 
                harsh neon light amidst the loud noise of the cranking machinery 
                and the gusts of heat emanating from their engines. They were 
                in an enormous open room with machinery and lines of conveyor 
                belts stretching in all directions. As they stood in anticipation, 
                more and more women filed in, and soon all the available spaces 
                were filled. And then, although there were many women still outside 
                waiting to get in, the factory doors were closed and the working 
                day began.<p>
                And tedious, tiring, monotonous and unrelenting it was too. Fortunately, 
                Tracey had had her share of factory jobs in the past, so she knew 
                more or less what was expected of her. Like the other girls on 
                her conveyor belt, she was issued with a pair of clear plastic 
                gloves which was all anyone had to wear, besides a little factory-issue 
                ribbon which was secured through the hair to keep it off her face. 
                Her job, like Zeta and Buttercup was to take the icy cold chicken 
                legs, breasts and wings as they trundled by, place the lump into 
                a polystyrene tray, and then wrap it tightly in a square of cellophane. 
                The wrapped piece of chicken was then replaced on the conveyor 
                belt where it trundled along to where some other women were weighing 
                them and sticking sticky-back labels on them. And that was it. 
                Chicken breast after chicken leg after chicken wing.<p>
                Tracey soon got into the rhythm of it. Boring, monotonous jobs 
                like this was all the work she'd ever had, and soon the rhythm 
                and routine overcame any sense of meaning and purpose. Buttercup 
                however was far less adept than her, and had great difficulty 
                in getting into any routine. She was packing one piece of chicken 
                for every three that Tracey packed, and the plastic was creased 
                and too loose. She began to weep with frustration as the effort 
                of it became too great for her.<p>
                Inevitably, her slower performance attracted attention from the 
                male supervisors who were wandering around in their blue overalls, 
                cloth caps and cigarettes. One came behind Tracey and Buttercup, 
                and watched the two of them with surly interest.<p>
                &quot;What's your name, dearie?&quot; he asked Buttercup, stubbing 
                his cigarette out on the cold hard factory floor. Nervously, Buttercup 
                told him.<p>
                &quot;Fuck! What sort of fucking ponced-up name is that? And what 
                about your friend. What're you called?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Tracey.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Fuck me! We got a right pair of fucking wierdies here. At 
                least 'buttercup' means something. But when in the name of fuck 
                did 'tracey' ever fucking mean anything. You're both a couple 
                of fucking immigrants, ain't you? Well, you'd better pull your 
                fucking socks up, Buttercup sweetie, (if you were ever allowed 
                to wear the fuckers) or you're out. There're lotsa other women 
                out there who'd do your job if they got the fucking chance.&quot;<p>
                With that, he left them with a sniff. Buttercup stared at Tracey 
                plaintively, her cheeks reddened with humiliation and shame, tears 
                of frustration etched onto her cheeks.<p>
                Eventually, after how many hours Tracey didn't know, there came 
                a rest break. The conveyor belt stopped and the pieces of chicken 
                stopped passing by. The girls sat down cross-legged on the hard 
                concrete floor, while other women came by with polystyrene cups 
                of insipid tea and limp slices of white bread covered with a sliver 
                of tasteless margarine. Tracey put an arm around her lover, who 
                continued to weep, while Zeta looked on at the two with sympathy.<p>
                &quot;Oi! Buttercup!&quot; yelled a man's voice. Tracey's lover 
                looked up startled. The man who'd spoken to them earlier was shouting 
                to them from the distance. &quot;Yeah! It's you I'm fucking talking 
                to. And your fucking dyke friend, as well. C'mere!&quot;<p>
                The two girls stood up, and looked at him and his colleagues who 
                were standing idly around a coffee machine. &quot;That's it, dearies. 
                This way!&quot; The girls hungrily demolished the last crumbs 
                of the bread, which disintegrated into a choking mulch in their 
                mouths, only digestible thanks to the liquid assistance of the 
                tea, and threaded their way through the sympathetic glances of 
                the other women to where they had been beckoned.<p>
                They stood obediently in front of the men's leering gazes. &quot;I 
                told you she were a babe, didn't I Ralph?&quot; the man who'd 
                spoken to them said to a fat middle-aged man with a dark brown 
                polyethylene tie, a grubby white shirt and a pair of shiny black 
                polyester trousers..<p>
                &quot;Yeah! You weren't fucking kidding either, Bob? She's the 
                best fucking piece of arse I've seen in a fuck of a while.&quot; 
                Ralph puffed out a mouthful of blue smoke, and took another drag 
                of his filter-tipped cigarette. &quot;So you're a fucking immigrant, 
                are you? Fucking out of Buggery with a fucking poncy name like 
                'Buttercup'! And your fucking friend. Is this bitch from Buggery 
                too? You look a bit fucking weird to me. Where'd you come from?&quot;<p>
                Tracey told him, and was surprised by how much it alarmed him. 
                &quot;Fuck me! You get all types these days! Well, don't expect 
                any different treatment while you're here, bitch. Women are the 
                same wherever the fuck they come from. You got no more fucking 
                rights than any other slut in Gomorrah. This is a man's world, 
                and you get treated the fucking same as any other bitch.&quot; 
                He let his cigarette drop from his fingers and stubbed it out 
                with his rubber-soled boot. &quot;And that means, bitch, that 
                you and your flower-fancying friend come up to the office, and 
                no fucking questions asked.&quot;<p>
                And so it was, having hardly recovered from their rape on the 
                Gomorran border, that Tracey and Buttercup were reminded of the 
                brutal realities of life in a man's world. Ralph and Bob led the 
                two girls up a concrete stairwell to an array of offices where 
                there were no women other themselves at all. All around them were 
                men either in uniforms or bad-fitting suits, in offices full of 
                the pallid aroma of cigarette smoke and covered in posters of 
                nude women and motor cars. As they walked by, the men's eyes followed 
                them, leering and unsympathetic. For the first time since she'd 
                left home, Tracey was acutely aware of her nakedness as the men 
                appraised her with the same air as evaluating any other functioning 
                set of machinery.<p>
                And then into Ralph's office, where there was a wooden desk covered 
                with papers and a bookshelf on the wall lined with ring-back folders. 
                There was a prominent calendar of some men buggering some scrawny 
                women. With no ceremony and no preparation, Ralph bade the girls 
                lie down on the nylon-carpeted floor, which they did with trepidation 
                under Ralph's and Bob's eyes, and those of a tall thin man in 
                a striped shirt with a polyester tie decorated with picture of 
                Bugs Bunny and Tweety Pie. And then Ralph, Bob and this other 
                man pulled down their trousers revealing an unappetising trio 
                of erect penises. Ralph's was short and stubby, surrounded by 
                a bush of dark curly hair halfway up its length. Bob's was thin 
                and narrow with a quite unpleasant smell. The third man's penis 
                was similarly thin and narrow with a slight bend in it.<p>
                And then, one after another, Buttercup and Tracey got to know 
                the penises rather better. Both girls knew better than to struggle. 
                Buttercup by virtue of her years in Buggery where sex for her 
                had often been of a similarly unpleasant coercive nature. Tracey 
                as a result of all the fucks she'd had over the years back home. 
                But however inexpert and unsubtle the fucks she'd got accustomed 
                to, in dark alley-ways, in multi-storey car park stairwells, behind 
                bus shelters, she'd had few which were quite as mechanical and 
                perfunctory. The pricks went in, slobbery stubbly faces scraped 
                against her cheeks and chin, her arms held down, and the thrusts 
                back and forth with a steady unimaginative rhythm. She looked 
                over at Buttercup who was enjoying it even less than her, eyes 
                closed and a grimace over her face. Above her Bob was pushing 
                away back and forth, while Ralph fucked away at her. And then 
                all change as Bruce, the tall thin man took over, grunting and 
                moaning above her, his tie drooping over Tracey's mouth as his 
                skinny hairy buttocks thrust back and forth and back and forth. 
                Tracey's cunt was sore as fuck. Sex wasn't usually this joyless.<p>
                And then, finally, an orchestrated trickle of sweet-sickly tasting 
                semen over the girls' naked breasts and faces, and the men were 
                standing, gasping and wheezing, as they eased their pricks back 
                inside their flies and adjusted their belts. Tracey and Buttercup 
                lay flat on the ground, semen-stained heads turned towards each 
                other. Tracey rested her hands on her crotch in a vain attempt 
                to lessen the ache that came from the inner folds of her cunt. 
                Buttercup with her hands drawn up and clasped together on her 
                chest, as if in prayer after the ordeal she had endured.<p>
                &quot;Well, girls! No more fucking sitting around enjoying yourself,&quot; 
                barked Ralph. &quot;It's back to the fucking shop floor with you 
                two. And no fucking shirking off either, you bitches! Don't think 
                that a bit of fun upstairs brings you whores any fucking special 
                privileges.&quot;<p>
                Buttercup and Tracey were then led back to the shop floor, semen 
                still over their faces and dripping down their thighs, through 
                a cordon of male office-workers who leered and grinned lasciviously 
                at them as they passed by. One took advantage of their vulnerability 
                to slap Buttercup forcibly on her buttocks causing her to yelp. 
                Several men laughed at her distress, Bob joining in.<p>
                &quot;You're a fucking popular whore with the boys!&quot; he grinned.<p>
                And then the two girls were back on the shop floor, by the side 
                of the conveyor belt, back to the monotony of packing chicken 
                parts. Buttercup was no more expert now than she was before, and 
                Tracey noticed how quiet she was and that she was still weeping. 
                She knew it wasn't just from the pain between her legs, as the 
                treatment they had received hadn't been harsh enough to cause 
                more than a stinging pain with a slight bruising on the vagina 
                lips. <p>
                &quot;They certainly like your friend,&quot; commented Upsilon, 
                a painfully thin girl with long mousy her was standing next to 
                Tracey. <p>
                &quot;But it's not right that they should fuck her. Or me for 
                that matter.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well, it makes a break from the packing. And you'll both 
                be getting extra rations for your efforts.&quot;<p>
                Indeed, this was true as Tracey found out when many hours later, 
                the conveyor belt stopped and all the girls queued up at a formica 
                top table where their dinner was doled out. This was a wholly 
                unappetising collection of stewed meat and over-boiled vegetables 
                served on a metal dish with more white bread and a bowl of unidentifiable 
                soup ladled out by the serving-women, all of them naked except 
                for the plastic hats which held in their hair. Both Tracey and 
                Buttercup were served substantially larger portions than any of 
                the other workers, and although it didn't actually taste especially 
                nice it was a welcome addition to their stomachs. Even after wolfing 
                it down, Tracey could still have eaten more.<p>
                She chatted with some of the other girls, while Buttercup sat 
                silently beside her, uncharacteristically morose and still tearful. 
                Tracey found that the girls came from settlements scattered all 
                over the place, that none of them enjoyed the work they did, and 
                none of them had any feeling other than contempt or disgust for 
                the male supervisors. <p>
                &quot;Don't worry about the fucking you got,&quot; smiled Upsilon. 
                &quot;It happens to all of us every now and then. It may not be 
                much fun but it is a break in the routine, and you do get more 
                to eat as a result. And anyway what do you expect from these pigs. 
                The bastards only know one thing about what to do with women, 
                and even that they don't do very well.&quot;<p>
                Then, back to the conveyor belt, and more hours of labour as the 
                sun's light through the factory windows arched around the building. 
                Chicken wing after chicken breast after chicken leg. And as they 
                worked, the male supervisors wandered round, pinching bottoms, 
                laughing libidinously and making coarse comments about breasts, 
                cunts, buttocks and anything else they could think of. Some women 
                were teased for being 'babes', some sneered at for being 'dogs', 
                some contemned for being 'whores', and any woman that showed any 
                sign of spirit was called a 'bitch'. Tracey had met plenty of 
                men like that back home, but somehow not so many in one place 
                and she guessed that here the misogyny was more sincerely and 
                deeply felt.<p>
                Buttercup was obviously hating her work, and her productivity 
                if anything was dropping as the afternoon progressed so painfully 
                slowly. Tracey regarded her lover with compassion, trying to imagine 
                the depths of her misery. But Buttercup's ordeal was not over. 
                A large, fat man in a suit with a striped nylon shirt and a plain 
                polyester tie loomed into sight, and with no warning or introduction 
                grabbed her by the breasts, groping them unsubtly in his large 
                hairy hands and took an ear in his moustachioed mouth. Buttercup 
                flashed a brief look of annoyance, was just about to react, but 
                then reasoned better of it.<p>
                &quot;So, you're the Buggery immigrant they told me about, dearie,&quot; 
                he sneered. &quot;Enjoying life here in Gomorrah?&quot;<p>
                Buttercup nodded her head meekly, while the man looked her up 
                and down, his tie dangling to the left of his large belly and 
                his hands still on her breasts.<p>
                &quot;Fuck me! You're fucking gorgeous! I ain't seen a bitch like 
                you here ever! They certainly know how to breed 'em in Buggery, 
                don't they? I've gotta have a piece of this action. Come with 
                me, dearie.&quot;<p>
                Buttercup was then led away by this corpulent man, who put an 
                arm around her naked waist, while the other male supervisors stood 
                to one side, restraining their usual leers and not making any 
                of the coarse remarks they might otherwise have done. And then 
                she was out of sight, and Tracey transferred her gaze back to 
                the pieces of chicken that were sliding down the conveyor belt 
                uninterrupted by this encounter. <p>
                &quot;Fuck!&quot; exclaimed Zeta. &quot;That was the manager. 
                Your friend's hit the jackpot!&quot;<p>
                Tracey was sure that this was not how Buttercup viewed the state 
                of affairs, but she smiled without comment and busied herself 
                in stretching the polythene over the cold pale piece of chicken 
                in its tray. She worked away for an agonisingly long time, wondering 
                what indignities was being meted out on her lover as the chicken 
                parts rolled by and even through her gloves the chickens' flesh 
                was feeling increasingly cold and slimy. She was almost certainly 
                being fucked, and she winced at the thought of this disgusting 
                fat man sinking what she imagined was another less than average 
                cock into her beloved's cunt; and possibly even her arse.<p>
                Eventually, after what seemed like, and may well have been, hours, 
                Buttercup returned, escorted by a thin man in overalls and collar-length 
                greasy hair. She looked even more unhappy than before, walking 
                with difficulty and occasionally rubbing her buttocks. Her face 
                was defaced by tears, and a stream of clear pale liquid was still 
                rolling viscously down her legs. She took her place back on the 
                conveyor belt next to Tracey and said nothing. It seemed that 
                the distraction of packing pieces of chicken was somehow a relief 
                to her.<p>
                It was much later, after one more tea break, that the working 
                day ended. The sun was well beneath the horizon, and the two girls, 
                like all the other women, were yawning and exhausted. The conveyor 
                belts stopped, the last pieces of chicken were wrapped in polythene 
                and labelled, and the workforce queued up to leave. Even leaving 
                was an ordeal. The queue went on forever, but as they left they 
                were all presented with a clear plastic bag holding a single packed 
                piece of chicken, which clearly represented their wages for a 
                day's work.<p>
                Tracey's package was larger than those of most of the others. 
                She had three pieces of chicken in a rather larger bag and a bar 
                of milk chocolate. Buttercup had even more. Some five pieces of 
                chicken, several bars of chocolate and four bottles of beer. The 
                man who singled her out and presented her with the flimsy bag, 
                which looked unlikely to last even the journey home, leered at 
                her and grinned.<p>
                &quot;You've made a fuck of an impression on the manager, sweetie. 
                'Snot often you bitches get beer. Hope you fucking enjoy it.&quot;<p>
                Buttercup accepted the bag gracefully, but Tracey could see that 
                she viewed it with some kind of disdain. And then they were out 
                in the dark outside. It had started to drizzle and the ground 
                was ever so unpleasantly damp under their feet. And then the long 
                walk home through the dark and dampness, following Zeta, all of 
                them too tired to talk and all looking forward to what little 
                home comforts that awaited them. The prize for their sexual favours 
                which had first seemed so welcome, became an increasing burden 
                as its weight added to their travails; and when, after the thin 
                plastic handles of the bags snapped from the weight, first Buttercup's, 
                then Tracey's, and Zeta's not at all, the rewards had to be carried 
                in their arms over the treacherous bumps and grooves of the muddying 
                fields they crossed.<p>
                All through the day, Tracey had been looking forward to Buttercup's 
                welcome caresses when they got back to the settlement. Surely, 
                they would be compensation for their suffering. But Buttercup 
                was not in the mood. Not from lack of trying, the girls' lovemaking 
                became less and less active, their sexual desires frustrated by 
                weariness and pain. And within half an hour of collapsing on the 
                straw in their hut, the drizzle on the outside becoming more insistent 
                and finally escalating into rain, the two girls were fast asleep, 
                their limbs entwined around each other, and Tracey's nose and 
                face buried in Buttercup's long blonde hair. Not a good day, Tracey 
                reflected, although part of her was already wondering what she 
                would get in exchange for the pieces of chicken she'd gained from 
                her otherwise unrewarding molestation, ironically of all the sex 
                she'd had recently the most like that she was accustomed to back 
                home.<p>
                XVII</p>
              <p>Neither Tracey nor Buttercup went to work in the factory the 
                following day: the excuse being that they needed to exchange the 
                proceeds of their day's labour for more immediately edible items. 
                Neither of them could live on chicken alone. They sought out Theta 
                Seven Six Seven Five.<p>
                She was very impressed by the wealth of returns the girls had 
                got from their single day there. In fact, she seemed very envious. 
                &quot;I've never done as well as this!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;The 
                men obviously took quite a shine to you!&quot;<p>
                Buttercup nodded modestly, but she clearly took no pride in what 
                all this had cost her. The girls exchanged a particularly juicy 
                chicken breast for some potatoes, a small knife and a small sauce 
                pan. Then Theta took them to the impromptu market place near the 
                centre of the settlement, which was lined by naked women whose 
                wares were laid out on the ground in front of them. It wasn't 
                that the wares for sale were especially appetising: raw vegetables, 
                bottles of beer, thawing bags of frozen vegetables, cans of soup 
                and beans, and other wares either gained from labour on the fields, 
                or, like the girls, from working in a factory. The girls eventually 
                walked away with a can-opener, a large box of kitchen matches, 
                a selection of not especially exciting canned food, a meat loaf 
                and some fresh greens. Tracey treated herself to a cigarette which 
                she greedily smoked as they sat down in their small hovel, examining 
                their purchases. She didn't really enjoy it very much: it didn't 
                taste nearly as pleasant as her nicotine withdrawal promised and 
                it made her feel queasy. Neither girl had felt very keen on actually 
                eating any of the chicken pieces they'd earned, so one thing definitely 
                not on the menu was fowl.<p>
                They cooked the food on a pile of dry sticks and twigs, eating 
                the tinned food directly from the cans in which they came, and 
                although it was a meal of convenience, it was, for Tracey, the 
                best meal she'd had since Throb. And a meal enjoyed the more for 
                sharing it with Buttercup whose body she later chewed and nibbled 
                with at least as much enthusiasm as for the baked beans and meat 
                loaf she'd eaten early: the trickle of tomato sauce on her chin 
                replaced by the much more satisfying taste of Buttercup's vaginal 
                juices.<p>
                As the two girls lay on the floor, their arms and legs entwined 
                and the sweat of their passion sticking their bodies even closer 
                to each other as they dried out in the morning heat, Buttercup 
                suddenly gave Tracey a very firm hug. &quot;I love you, Tracey,&quot; 
                she exclaimed. &quot;I love you so much!&quot;<p>
                Tracey gasped. &quot;You what?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I've never had a proper relationship before. Sure, I had 
                relationships with the other girls and boys behind the wall, but 
                this is different. It's free. We're not prisoners like I was before. 
                Sure the sex was good. Very good. But with you, it's different. 
                It's better. It's real love!&quot;<p>
                Tracey sighed. She kissed Buttercup full on the mouth and soon 
                again they were writhing and caressing together in the discomfort 
                of the grass and straw which composed their mattress, but however 
                much she was sure her tongue was giving Buttercup pleasure, she 
                somehow didn't feel worthy of her lover. How could someone like 
                her, someone who was used to being called a slut, whose cunt had 
                taken in every prick it could, be worthy of someone so absurdly 
                beautiful and so ridiculously perfect as Buttercup? She had the 
                sort of body most women would die for, and here she was, laid 
                open to Tracey's attention as if &#133; as if she were someone 
                better than the girl she was. She just didn't deserve such good 
                fortune.<p>
                After the girls had recovered from their passion and ecstasy, 
                they ventured into the settlement as a whole. Despite its obvious 
                poverty, it was very well organised, and Tracey was impressed 
                by how much trust all these naked women displayed. None of them 
                seemed to fear theft of any kind. Food and other possessions were 
                laid out so easy to steal, and no one took advantage of it. Back 
                home, Tracey would have conformed to the law of taking what she 
                could, but despite her avarice, even she couldn't see herself 
                claiming as her own the many things left lying around carelessly 
                around and inside the tents and small makeshift shelters. But 
                she still found it very strange surrounded by all these naked, 
                hirsute women and not a man in sight. Young girls were running 
                about unselfconsciously in their naked state. Older women were 
                sitting around idly or working at whatever task that occupied 
                them. And many more hovels were empty than occupied, as most women 
                were out elsewhere, perhaps working in factories like the one 
                Tracey and Buttercup had the previous day.<p>
                However, the next day, it was up early and off with Zeta over 
                the dry-baked fields to the same chicken factory as before. This 
                time they knew what to expect and the day didn't seem quite as 
                long, though this time they were on a part of the production line 
                where they had to slice the freshly plucked chickens into the 
                pieces which later in the line other women were sealing in cellophane 
                as they had the last time they worked there. Buttercup was no 
                more adept in using the sharp knife she gripped in her plastic-gloved 
                hand than she was in wrapping the same cold, pink flesh in clear 
                plastic, but in truth her ability at cutting and slicing was not 
                what determined her reward at the end of the day.<p>
                At first, Tracey thought when Frank grabbed her from behind that 
                Buttercup might use the knife she held in her hand to stab it 
                into the scrawny man in his battered grey suit. But despite her 
                obvious annoyance, she meekly followed him up the concrete stairs 
                to wherever he did whatever he did to her. It was ages until Buttercup 
                returned, looking miserable and humiliated, a small trail of blood 
                winding down the inside of her thigh, escorted by a male supervisor 
                with the soggy end of a rolled-up cigarette held in p[ace by moist 
                saliva to his lower lip.<p>
                And that wasn't the only such departure from the production line 
                Buttercup endured. Clearly word had gone round the male workers 
                that there was a girl on the shop floor of far better than average 
                appearance, and Buttercup was dragged away on three other occasions. 
                This included the manager who had obviously not had enough of 
                her after the earlier occasion. After each excursion, she seemed 
                weaker and more ashamed than the time before, and her hands were 
                visibly trembling as her knife viciously sliced through the tendons 
                which held the legs or wings onto the chickens' breasts, and gutted 
                the offal out of its clammy cold interior.<p>
                On only one occasion was Tracey similarly dragged away, and this 
                was during one of those agonisingly long periods when Buttercup 
                had been taken away. This was by Jack, an unshaven supervisor 
                with a disproportionately large gut for a man of otherwise unremarkable 
                girth, who dragged her into a small dark room at the back of the 
                factory where a smelly damp mattress had been laid down on the 
                floor for this exact purpose. He apparently had a thing for sluts 
                with short hair, but even so his attentions were concentrated 
                entirely in fucking her and requiring her to give his short fat 
                cabbage-smelling cock a sucking beforehand. Tracey hardly felt 
                him as he pushed his prick back and forth in her cunt, taking 
                a fuck of a long time to even become stiff long before his interminable 
                thrusting released any sperm which he did right inside her. <p>
