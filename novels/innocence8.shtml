                In Which Innocence is found in a Vegan Commune; and gains profit 
                by untrammelled display to an unknown public; and in which Dodie 
                discovers Innocence in the cool mountain air.
              <p>Innocence made the journey to Brook by train, waving goodbye 
                to her sister and Kedi and wearing the clothes she thought best 
                suited her destination. These were a pair of baggy shorts, sandals 
                and little else except for the rucksack she had over her shoulders. 
                She had decided that the clothes of her sister's district were 
                not really appropriate. The train eventually surfaced in Brook 
                and she disembarked at the town of Sauterelle. She didn't know 
                anyone in Brook except her former lover, Purity, and she thought 
                it would be best to stay with her.<p>
                She didn't really know where to go when she arrived in the town 
                - it was much larger than Divin and there were no signposts pointing 
                to Purity's commune. She humped her rucksack over her back and 
                wandered through the streets of thronging bare flesh forever glancing 
                around in the hope of seeing Purity's distinctive dark skin. Purity 
                had given her some very sketchy directions but they didn't seem 
                at all adequate as she paused by a street map just outside a municipal 
                building. She felt curiously conservative in a town where almost 
                all younger people were thoroughly naked and she could compare 
                her own hidden endowments with those of all the men there. However, 
                the street map was of some assistance and she established that 
                the way to Purity's commune was several miles away. After a lot 
                of questioning and searching around, she eventually found a bus 
                which took her within two miles of the commune from which she 
                could walk. <p>
                She had curiously romantic views of what Purity's commune would 
                be like. She did not expect it to be in such a very rundown farmhouse. 
                Just outside, sitting in the sun, were a naked couple in the distinctive 
                unkempt appearance that Purity had expected: the man with a long 
                untidy beard obscuring what little of his face was not already 
                covered by his long hair and the woman's face similarly hidden 
                by her long curtains of hair. Innocence introduced herself to 
                them. &quot;I'm looking for my friend Purity,&quot; she explained. 
                <p>
                &quot;Purity,&quot; mused the woman pushing a curtain of hair 
                to one side revealing a long nipple on a tiny breast. &quot;I 
                don't think she's here at the moment. She's always going off all 
                over the place, isn't she?&quot; <p>
                &quot;Yes,&quot; agreed the man. &quot;She's always travelling. 
                I don't think she's decided what she wants from Brook.&quot; <p>
                Seeing how disappointed Innocence was with her friend not there 
                and discovering that she really didn't have alternative accommodation, 
                the couple said that she could stay at least until the evening 
                when the commune could discuss if she could stay longer. All decisions 
                affecting the commune had to be decided communally and there were 
                meetings every night for several hours concerning the issues involved. 
                &quot;I think we spend more time talking about what we can do 
                than actually doing it!&quot; remarked the man. <p>
                While Innocence waited for the evening meeting to start, she was 
                introduced to other people of the commune. Everyone had let their 
                hair grow freely, wherever there was hair to grow, and Innocence 
                felt very odd with only the stubble of hair on her head which 
                made her look thin and slightly malnourished. They also wore no 
                clothes at all - not even robes or jewellery or shoes - making 
                Innocence feel even more distinct from her company. Not only was 
                there an attitude of naturalness in how people appeared, there 
                was a total openness about their sexual behaviour. Several couples 
                or groups of more than two were indulging in sex when Innocence 
                first met them, and there was no attempt to stop for Innocence's 
                sake. The man would continue fucking away while chatting, totally 
                unembarrassed about it and totally unconcerned about any sensitivity 
                Innocence might have. <p>
                Innocence joined in the communal dinner which was a kind of amorphous 
                mush of boiled vegetables which tasted overcooked and rather too 
                spicy. There was no crockery or cutlery used and Innocence had 
                to dip her hand into a large mound of tepid mush to take handfuls 
                of the food and then direct into her mouth what little of it didn't 
                immediately fall onto either the floor or onto her breasts. She 
                began to appreciate the lack of clothes as a way of keeping the 
                laundry duties low. <p>
                Eventually, and in a somewhat chaotic way, the meal evolved into 
                the communal meeting she'd been told about. She sat through what 
                seemed to her a very tedious discussion between at most three 
                of the twenty or so people gathered there concerning the political 
                and moral perspectives regarding fairly mundane things such as 
                a shit rota, the division of shared spaces for the benefit of 
                women's freedom from male oppression and the need to demarcate 
                the commune from the road by some kind of a sign. Almost all the 
                discussions were unresolved and there were no votes taken. One 
                of the people who did most of the talking had a habit of wandering 
                well off any subject of general interest to such subjects as her 
                personal relationships and her unsympathetic views on people who 
                wore wool or silk. <p>
                Innocence tried hard to appear as interested in the discussion 
                as she felt she ought to be, but she felt rather disorientated 
                and focused on the joints that were being passed around and had 
                more than once lost touch of what the actual topic of discussion 
                was supposed to be. It, therefore, came as a bit of a surprise 
                to become aware that she was now the subject of conversation and 
                that a man with only a nose visible through the black and grey 
                hair of his face was trying to attract her attention. <p>
                &quot;Do you agree or not, sister?&quot; he was asking. <p>
                Sister? Wondered Innocence, thinking for a moment they must have 
                thought she was still a nun, but then remembered that everyone 
                addressed each other as sister or brother. &quot;With what?&quot; 
                <p>
                &quot;You can stay in the commune for as long as you help with 
                the chores and preparing the food,&quot; prompted a man near her 
                whose attempts at growing a beard had resulted in only a few sorry 
                black wispy strands. <p>
                &quot;And that you take off those disgusting clothes!&quot; snorted 
                a rather fat woman with a rather large and furry birthmark on 
                her thigh. <p>
                Innocence didn't feel able to argue in her marijuana-induced haze, 
                so against her normal inclination she took off her shorts and 
                knickers and stood up shakily feeling a little ridiculous. Her 
                penis dangled down with no feeling, but attracting a great deal 
                of attention. &quot;I agree with everything you say,&quot; she 
                said in a voice that sounded rather incoherent and wobbly. <p>
                &quot;Are you a brother or a sister?&quot; asked one of the main 
                speakers. <p>
                &quot;What a sexist question!&quot; immediately snapped another. 
                <p>
                &quot;Gender is not important!&quot; agreed another. <p>
                The meeting degenerated into a fervent argument - with everyone 
                in agreement - that Innocence's gender was not a subject of discussion, 
                dispute or voyeurism, while it was quite clear to Innocence, as 
                she slowly lowered herself onto a bean bag, that she was the subject 
                of all these things. She sadly picked up her shorts and knickers 
                and hesitated over putting them back on again, but decided rather 
                to pack them hastily into her rucksack which was resting just 
                behind her. <p>
                &quot;Don't worry about it, sister,&quot; said one man with a 
                wispy pale goatee and long pale hair. &quot;You're accepted into 
                the commune.&quot; <p>
                &quot;Am I?&quot; Wondered Innocence slowly stroking her penis 
                and watching with a kind of disinterested fascination as it falteringly 
                got larger. She noticed as she masturbated herself that she was 
                watched with rather the same fascination as an animal in a zoo, 
                and nobody took the opportunity to join her. She felt quite lonely 
                as she came into her hands and allowed the semen to trickle through 
                her fingers and onto the floor. Before long her consciousness 
                left her and she collapsed on the floor by her own little stain 
                and amongst the spillage of her dinner. All around her the meeting 
                continued, apparently regardless, concerning matters of awesome 
                triviality which made staying awake inconceivably difficult. <p>
                The commune seemed to be divided into a majority whose work was 
                concentrated entirely on the running of the commune and felt a 
                certain satisfaction in their separatism from the outside world 
                and those whose contribution to the commune was to bring in the 
                money they earned by working. Perhaps because Innocence had never 
                adopted the commune by choice, she felt more sympathy with those 
                in the latter category. One of these was Bouche, a girl who didn't 
                even pretend to have no interest in Innocence's penis but spent 
                rather a lot of time admiring and discussing it. To Innocence 
                this actually felt better than the company of most of the others 
                who so studiously averted their attention from her most prominent 
                feature in a way that made Innocence feel actually rather more 
                self-conscious and embarrassed. Most people in the commune, however, 
                avoided contact with her altogether.<p>
                Bouche was a petite girl with tiny breasts that were mostly nipple 
                and very girlish hips. Like all the girls in the commune she didn't 
                believe in even the ostentation of a ribbon in her hair but she 
                did nonetheless plait her hair. This meant that her face shone 
                out rather than being obscured by either a curtain or a mound 
                of hair. She made her living, Innocence was intrigued to find, 
                in a photographic studio. <p>
                &quot;Are you a model?&quot; Innocence wondered.<p>
                &quot;No, not at all,&quot; laughed Bouche. &quot;I don't think 
                I've got quite the right figure or features. And, anyway, I'd 
                have to shave my legs and get my hair styled to do that.&quot; 
                What Bouche did, Innocence discovered, was to fellate the male 
                models who posed for the studio. There wasn't much of a demand 
                for just nude models in the newspapers and magazines of Brook 
                as nudity was so widely visible, but the demand for erotic or 
                pornographic photographs was in no way diminished because of that. 
                What she did was help at the studio by stimulating the penises 
                of the male models so that they were fully erect for the photographs 
                that would appear in women's magazines or newspapers. This inevitably 
                included semen shots, but these weren't always used. &quot;It's 
                not always very photogenic,&quot; Bouche explained. A lot of people 
                in the commune disapproved of Bouche's source of income, but it 
                didn't bother her. &quot;They say it's sexual exploitation and 
                I'm contributing to it. But I'm not the one being photographed 
                and it's not like proper sex, not like real pornography. And besides 
                I enjoy it. I can give several dozen blow jobs in a day. And I've 
                become an expert.&quot; She smiled indulgently at Innocence. &quot;Here. 
                Let me demonstrate.&quot;<p>
                Innocence didn't mind as Bouche took her penis into her hand and 
                then with a mixture of caressing with her fingers, licking with 
                her tongue and manipulating her lips, throat and teeth, bring 
                it to a very full erection. &quot;The art of my work,&quot; explained 
                Bouche when Innocence's penis was as engorged as it had ever been, 
                &quot;is to bring the penis to its maximum point and to hold it 
                there for as long a time as possible. And, my! You certainly are 
                splendidly endowed!&quot;<p>
                Innocence also needed to earn some money. Her sister's generosity 
                was not sufficient for Innocence to stay in Brook for very long, 
                and she didn't feel too enthusiastic about spending her time emptying 
                latrines, preparing stews and attending the interminable meetings. 
                There was no evidence of Purity returning yet, and Innocence felt 
                she'd rather see a little more of Brook than just Sauterelle. 
                She'd heard, for instance, of the snow-covered mountains of Les 
                Grandes Petites, and wanted the opportunity to visit them. Bouche 
                appreciated that and suggested to Innocence that she pose for 
                her photographic studio. &quot;They mostly only photograph men, 
                but I'm sure they'd make an exception in your case. And because 
                you're so (let's face it!) unusual you'll probably get paid a 
                better rate.&quot;<p>
                Innocence had more than a few reservations about being photographed 
                by strangers and then to be viewed by many more strangers in their 
                magazines and journals, but Bouche persuaded her that there really 
                wasn't any pain involved. &quot;You don't have to spend more than 
                a couple of hours in the studio. And it'll be more than worth 
                your while.&quot; Innocence walked with Bouche into the town of 
                Sauterelle, feeling really very embarrassed with her penis dangling 
                between her legs. She hated the attention it attracted as she 
                walked by - some of it shock, some of it persistent curiosity 
                and some of it people simply turning their heads to have a second 
                look. She felt she'd been right to keep her assets well-hidden 
                and resolved to return to wearing her shorts when she'd left the 
                commune to see the rest of Brook. It sometimes occurred to her 
                that one of the other reasons she was attracting attention was 
                because of the extreme shortness of her hair which was still only 
                a few days' growth.<p>
                The photographic studio was just above a shop in one of the main 
                streets in Sauterelle and very well-equipped in technical equipment. 
                She didn't know the names of even a fraction of the machines she 
                could see but nonetheless they were very impressive. The photographer 
                was a small gay man who wore a beret over his shoulder-length 
                hair and had a ring pierced through the foreskin of his long thin 
                penis. He had a curious habit of tweaking and stroking his penis 
                as he spoke but it gave no sign of having an independent life.<p>
                &quot;So you're Innocence,&quot; the photographer smiled. &quot;You 
                even exceed the description Bouche gave me of you! I really must 
                take advantage of your kind offer. I've already cancelled two 
                other engagements. And if need be I'll cancel more.&quot; He took 
                Innocence's balls in his hand and gently bounced them up and down 
                as if weighing them. &quot;And you're so very beautiful!&quot; 
                <p>
                The rest of the session took place in a room at the back involving 
                a bewildering array of backdrops and in which countless lamps 
                and cameras were pointed at Innocence. The pattern of each session 
                was much the same - and the photographer insisted on several of 
                these for which he offered ever more tempting sums of money. The 
                photographer and Bouche chatted with Innocence on subjects of 
                bizarre inconsequentiality, such as the weather, the football 
                league or the design of a neighbour's shop-front. All the time, 
                Bouche would stroke her penis and occasionally take it into her 
                mouth as if waiting for a time when it was ready. Then, as if 
                an invisible and inaudible signal had been transmitted, Bouche 
                would start getting more energetic with her fellatio and the photographer 
                would move towards his cameras talking all the time, but interjecting 
                his patter with comments such as &quot;That's right!&quot;, &quot;You're 
                doing fine!&quot; and &quot;It's coming on now!&quot; As this 
                happened, Bouche's skilled attention caused her penis to engorge 
                to that almost bursting extent she'd succeeded in achieving at 
                the commune.<p>
                Then Bouche would disengage her mouth and hands from Innocence's 
                penis, but not her eyes which she kept focused on Innocence's 
                eyes in a way that communicated love, concern and encouragement. 
                Innocence could see Bouche's value to the photographer as she 
                stayed under the gaze of the photographers rapidly shuttering 
                camera with an erect penis that seemed to have lost all memory 
                of what it was like to be small. It stayed erect for what seemed 
                like forever, while the photographer coaxed Innocence into different 
                sitting and standing poses with a variety of backdrops he selected. 
                Some of these backdrops featured bedrooms or other rooms in a 
                house. Some of these were outside scenes of mountains, lakes or 
                cities. Others were completely surreal - such as outer space, 
                mythical countries or prehistoric environments. Sometimes Innocence 
                would be asked to hold her penis forward in some triumphant pose. 
                Sometimes to put a hand behind her stubbled head with a coy smile. 
                Sometimes she was asked to put a finger in her anus and then to 
                put it to her mouth or nose. Occasionally, Bouche would intervene 
                to give Innocence's penis a little stroke or even to put the glans 
                in her mouth to keep her member in a sufficient state of excitement.<p>
                The session would end, again decided by Bouche's and the photographer's 
                experienced skill, with Bouche exciting Innocence's penis exactly 
                to the point of coming and then Bouche would disappear out of 
                camera shot as Innocence masturbated off the drops of semen that 
                she could squeeze out of her. At this stage the photographer would 
                come very close to the top of Innocence's penis to make sure of 
                capturing the moment each stream of semen came free of her penis 
                and spurt forth.<p>
                After each session, Innocence felt no less exhausted than Bouche 
                and the photographer seemed to be, and quite happily collapsed 
                on the bed that was made available with Bouche on one side and 
                the photographer on the other, who recommenced his comforting 
                prattle. Innocence felt somehow better for attracting so much 
                attention to her body, but also felt that this wasn't an experience 
                she'd like to repeat for a long time. Her balls ached in a curious 
                way and there was a very strong and rich smell given off by her 
                genitals.<p>
                However, Innocence was delighted by the cash she received at the 
                end of her day. It was far more than she'd expected and more than 
                enough for her to leave the commune at Sauterelle and see Les 
                Grandes Petites. That evening, when she headed back to her hammock 
                at the commune after eating a hamburger and chips at a take-away, 
                in preference to the lentil and bean mush she'd otherwise have 
                to eat, she resolved to leave the following day unless Purity 
                appeared. And as Purity was as far away as ever, Innocence found 
                herself several days later walking up the mountain passes of Les 
                Grandes Petites. It was wonderful to get away from people! exclaimed 
                Innocence to herself. It was a warm day, but even so she could 
                feel a little cool draught coming down from the snowy peaks. She 
                wore only the boots she'd bought at a mountaineering shop at the 
                nearest resort and the rucksack over her shoulders in which she 
                kept her other clothes, a flask of coffee and some sandwiches. 
                It was with relief about a half hour earlier that she'd decided 
                she was sufficiently isolated from anyone's curiosity to abandon 
                the shorts she'd returned to wearing all the time since she'd 
                left the commune at Sauterelle. It was curious to Innocence how 
                her present nudity seemed to differ from that of the commune where 
                it had almost been a religion rather than a preference. She wasn't 
                too sorry to leave the commune, its tasteless food and uncomfortable 
                sleeping arrangements, its overwhelming smell of body odour and 
                bad breath. But it was with sadness that she'd left Bouche and 
                she hoped that when she'd return that Purity would be there.<p>
                The mountains were beautiful. She always felt she was coming to 
                the top of them but each time she reached the top of a ridge there 
                was always another much larger one looming over it. Sometimes 
                she paused and sat on the coarse grass which intermingled with 
                her pubic hairs watching the view of Brook stretching out beneath 
                her with the inhabitants looking like tiny insects and their towns 
                like insect nests. Occasionally, she paused that little bit longer 
                to eat a ration of sandwiches, to read her guide book or simply 
                to lie on her back in the sun-warmed stubbly grass and allow the 
                sun to bake her breasts and groin. Perhaps, she thought, I'll 
                lose all evidence of the whiteness that marks where I've worn 
                my shorts.<p>
                The guide book she had was one which Bouche had lent her and was 
                written by someone who had an ideological perspective on everything. 
                Innocence found it a bit annoying that there seemed to be nothing 
                about Brook and its landscape that didn't have a history of political 
                struggle or a contemporary ideological resonance associated with 
                it. <p>
                After a while, Innocence reached the object of her walk which 
                was to reach the glacier which marked the lowest altitude at which 
                she could expect to meet snow. She walked up to the glacier and 
                then gingerly trod into the crunchy slightly thawing snow. She 
                felt the coolness of it on her ankles just over her boots. Then 
                suddenly, with a curious passion and impulsiveness she threw herself 
                bodily into the white crisp snow so she could feel it against 
                her skin. She luxuriated in the snow as she rolled around in it, 
                dripped it over her breasts and packed it against her groin. Her 
                penis responded to the cold by shrivelling to ever such a tiny 
                size. She felt it with her fingers. It was curiously warm as a 
                contrast to the ice in which it had been dripped. This contrast 
                was enough to stimulate it and soon her penis was as large as 
                it had previously been small and she started unselfconsciously 
                masturbating with her knees sinking in the snow.<p>
                Not totally unselfconsciously though, as she suddenly noticed 
                someone also with extremely short hair watching her from a rock 
                just to the edge of the glacier. At first Innocence thought this 
                might be some kind of mirage and she was looking at a mirror reflection 
                of herself, as women with such very short hair were rather unusual 
                in Brook unless they were nuns. But this girl had a very skinny 
                body with tiny breasts just like Bouche.<p>
                &quot;Don't stop!&quot; pleaded the girl when she noticed that 
                Innocence had spotted her. &quot;I've really enjoyed watching 
                you! And you've got such a wonderful dick!&quot;<p>
                Well really! thought Innocence. She wasn't masturbating for this 
                woman's pleasure. Crossly Innocence picked herself up and waded 
                through the snow away from her partially melted patch towards 
                where she'd left her rucksack.<p>
                &quot;Don't go! Please!&quot; pleaded the girl standing up. She, 
                like Innocence, was wearing only boots and a rucksack, but there 
                was a glimmer shining from her crotch and nipples which really 
                didn't seem very natural. Innocence paused briefly, but then continued. 
                Why did her days of solitude have to be disturbed so?<p>
                &quot;You're Innocence aren't you!&quot; Shouted the girl. &quot;I've 
                heard so much about you!&quot;<p>
                Innocence started. How did this total stranger know her? Was it 
                those photographs she'd had taken of her? Had her freakish fame 
                spread so far? The girl ran towards her, and Innocence could see 
                further glimmerings from the brilliant sun through the ice-blue 
                sky reflecting from what she could now identify as body jewellery. 
                And such a lot of it! Her ears seemed to be a mass of earrings. 
                A ring through her nose. Great round rings through her nipples 
                and a collection of shiny gold and silver metal attached around 
                her groin. A woman clothed only in precious metal.<p>
                &quot;I'm a friend of Mouse's!&quot; announced the girl. &quot;My 
                name's Dodie! I knew you were in Brook. Your sister told Mouse 
                about you leaving. I never expected to see you though! And you 
                do have the most wonderful prick!&quot; <p>
                Innocence stood by her rucksack on the grass looking bemusedly 
                as Dodie herself stepped out of the snow and her brilliantly edged 
                shadow obscured the few flowers surrounded by melted snow. <p>
                &quot;It's beautiful! I must touch it!&quot; gasped Dodie, coming 
                to within feet of Innocence. Dodie reached out her hand and took 
                the round mass of Innocence's testicles in her palm. &quot;It 
                feels so firm and sure! You must be the luckiest girl in the world!&quot;<p>
                Innocence wasn't sure that she felt like that, but she settled 
                down in the grass next to Dodie and allowed her to put her arms 
                around her and to caress her breasts and stimulate her penis. 
                She'd had so many hands caress her that she somehow didn't mind 
                a couple more, even from someone who only knew her by report and 
                whom she'd never heard of before.<p>
                &quot;You've got Cafard's classic guidebook!&quot; exclaimed Dodie, 
                suddenly taking one hand off Innocence's penis and reaching for 
                the guidebook Bouche had lent her which was lying just by Innocence's 
                sandwiches. &quot;How wonderful! And I didn't know you were at 
                all political! But then Mouse wouldn't know would she!&quot;<p>
                Innocence reflected on the truth of that - Mouse hadn't the slightest 
                interest in political, social or ethical matters. However, Innocence 
                wasn't especially marked for her political interests either. &quot;It's 
                not mine, I'm afraid! I'm borrowing it!&quot;<p>
                &quot;Don't you find it puts Brook into perspective though?&quot; 
                Remarked Dodie detaching her other hand from Innocence's left 
                breast and used it to support the book on her lap. Innocence felt 
                slightly discarded by this sudden change of Dodie's attention. 
                Her attention was focused on the rings and studs embellishing 
                Dodie's groin and hidden tantalisingly within the bush of her 
                pubic hair. &quot;People think of Brook as just being some kind 
                of naturist holiday resort. A place where you can take your clothes 
                off and fuck in public. But it's so much more than that! It's 
                a whole history of political struggle for freedom. A struggle 
                to retain its own distinctive identity in an unsympathetic nation.&quot;<p>
                Innocence's mind wandered as Dodie concentrated her thoughts on 
                politics, and she let her gaze return to the hills. The political 
                struggle wasn't there at the moment, she thought. What there was 
                was the swerve and sweep of swifts, the song of birds hidden in 
                trees, the ticking of cicadas in the distance and the shadows 
                of the mountains etched against the deep blue of the sky. She 
                gradually became aware of hands attaching themselves to her thighs. 
                She looked down to see Dodie, who had taken off her boots, kneeling 
                in front of her, resting a hand on each of her thighs, looking 
                imploringly up at her.<p>
                &quot;May I?&quot; Dodie asked in a curiously submerged voice 
                glancing pointedly at Innocence's penis. Innocence nodded. She 
                stayed transfixed by the view while Dodie's mouth engaged itself 
                on Innocence's penis with a passion that she'd not experienced 
                since she'd last made love to Mouse. Dodie wasn't as technically 
                proficient at fellatio as Bouche, but there was no doubting her 
                passion or the joy in which she licked up the semen that eventually 
                came pumping forth and threatened to stain the scenery.<p>
