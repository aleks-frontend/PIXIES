              <p>&quot;Who the fuck are you?&quot; were the words by which the 
                two girls were woken just a few hours later. They raised up their 
                weary heads from the hard straw pillows which had come to seem 
                so incredibly comfortable, and blearily focused on the towering 
                figure of a woman dressed only in leather boots and leather shoulder-pads. 
                This in itself made the woman a formidable and intimidating sight, 
                but this was reinforced by a body which was more muscular than 
                either Sharon or Tracey were sure a woman's body should ever be. 
                But she was clearly a woman, and one who shaved her vagina as 
                well. Although nearly naked, rather a lot of heavy iron and leather 
                decorated her, dangling from pierced nipples and vagina. She wore 
                a leather belt around her waist from which dangled a long holster 
                for a truncheon and a collection of buckled leather bags.<p>
                &quot;We're friends of Primrose,&quot; explained Sharon wearily.<p>
                &quot;They're tourists, Tiger Lilly dearest,&quot; added Primrose 
                who entered the room at that moment. &quot;I found them lying 
                under the baobab, absolutely exhausted and suffering from heat 
                stroke. I don't know how they'd got there, but it was obvious 
                they couldn't stay there forever. So I thought I'd bring them 
                back home to keep them away from trouble.&quot;<p>
                &quot;By bringing trouble here to our fucking cottage, you mean!&quot;<p>
                &quot;Tiger Lilly, what harm does it do? As long as they're on 
                their way soon we'll be alright.&quot;<p>
                &quot;It's not for us to harbour foreigners. They might be fucking 
                spies or something! We should hand them in to the authorities 
                so that they can be properly processed.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Like processed meat, you mean, Tiger Lilly. Do you want 
                then to be raped and humiliated by the police. It's obvious they're 
                not spies. They're just ignorant tourists. They probably just 
                got lost going to the beach.&quot; Primrose smiled indulgently 
                at the pathetic sight of Sharon and Tracey's peeling sunburn and 
                raw red marks on their upper chest. &quot;I mean, I know you're 
                police yourself, but if we took them in you don't think your colleagues 
                won't give you a bit of rough interrogation as well. Once the 
                police get their hands into anything, they usually leave more 
                battered bodies and corpses around than there were to start off 
                with. They'd suspect the heir apparent if he happened to be passing 
                by. No, Tiger Lilly sweetheart, things'd only get worse if we 
                took them to the authorities. Leave them to relax. No one'll tell 
                the police, and you know it.&quot;<p>
                Tiger Lilly snorted reluctantly, and let Primrose escort her out 
                of the bedroom, leaving the two girls slumped on the bed. Sharon 
                was feeling ever so faintly sick and Tracey had a persistent burning 
                sensation on her shoulders and on the top of her bum which just 
                didn't seem to want to go away. Within seconds, they collapsed 
                back into a feverish sleep, their naked bodies intertwined to 
                stop themselves falling off the edges of the single bed.<p>
                It was about an hour later that Primrose returned to the bedroom 
                with a faint smile. &quot;We'd best get you two tidied up!&quot; 
                she said, handing the girls sleeveless white cotton blouses which 
                would come down to the base of their breasts and no further. They 
                had no chance to put them on, as she then produced a small tin 
                bowl in the warm steamy water of which was floating a large sponge. 
                Then with no evidence of ceremony, Primrose started vigorously 
                scrubbing Sharon's face, body and limbs. It was like scrubbing 
                a floor dry. Every few seconds she would squeeze out the moisture 
                from the sponge into the bowl, and then began scrubbing other 
                parts. As soon as she'd judged that Sharon was clean, she started 
                scrubbing Tracey with just the same vigour. When her attention 
                came to the area between Tracey's legs where all her rings were 
                dangling from her reddened and sore stubbled vagina, she paused 
                as if in thought. She then leant forward and briefly kissed Tracey's 
                pierced clitoris.<p>
                &quot;That's a lovely ring!&quot; She said smiling. &quot;That 
                would cost me more than a month's wages.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Is it?&quot; wondered Tracey, who had actually thought it 
                remarkably cheap compared to how much such jewellery would have 
                cost back home. Of course, she'd not actually paid for it, but, 
                even taking into account the cost of the piercing, she knew it 
                was substantially cheaper than any of the countless fucks she'd 
                had in Throb.<p>
                &quot;It's beautiful!&quot; Primrose continued, picking up the 
                sponge and proceeding to scrub the dust and dirt off Tracey's 
                legs. &quot;But you tourists just don't know the value of things 
                do you? At least that's what we hear. That you're all stupid and 
                sex-mad, but ridiculously wealthy.&quot; She paused thoughtfully. 
                &quot;Is it true, that? I mean, that you're wealthy?&quot;<p>
                &quot;What do you fucking think!&quot; snorted Sharon. &quot;Do 
                we look like we're rich?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I don't know,&quot; said Primrose sadly. &quot;I don't know 
                what rich people look like. I've never seen one in my life.&quot;<p>
                Primrose finally finished her cleaning and squeezed out the filthy 
                water into the tin bowl. &quot;You're clearly pretty na&iuml;ve, 
                aren't you,&quot; she continued. &quot;Things in Buggery are quite 
                different to wherever you come from, I can see that. I'd better 
                give you a bit of advice on what to wear here. It's very important 
                you do, otherwise you'll be picked up by the police, and, believe 
                me, that is the very last thing you want to happen. In fact, it 
                could well be the last thing that does happen to you. Fortunately, 
                the police are relatively lax in this district, but you've still 
                got to be pretty careful about your appearance. If you look too 
                much out of place, you'll be arrested and then &#133; Well, I 
                don't know what, but when the police get hold of you, it'll be 
                lucky if you'll survive their interrogation. You mustn't wear 
                anything from the knee to the midriff. The punishment for non-observance 
                is arbitrary and cruel. So, if I were you, put on these old blouses 
                of mine and, if you don't want to attract attention keep your 
                jewellery down to just one ring about here.&quot; She fingered 
                the ring she had joining the two flaps of her vulva.<p>
                &quot;Who decides what people wear?&quot; wondered Sharon as she 
                detached her earrings and nose-stud, and placed them on the rickety 
                bedside table. She glanced around the room, having recovered sufficiently 
                after her scrubbing to comprehend things. Not only was it very 
                small, but it was very bare. The only decoration was a faded portrait 
                of the king.<p>
                Primrose followed Sharon's gaze. &quot;Him, of course. The King. 
                And he changes his mind all the time! Not long ago, people were 
                allowed to wear shorts or little skirts as long as they covered 
                less than two inches of inside leg. But then he decided we all 
                had to have little cunt-rings, and to make sure we were wearing 
                them we were proscribed from wearing anything down there.&quot;<p>
                &quot;What happened to all the shorts and skirts?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Oh they were publicly burnt. There was a big festival, which 
                everyone had to attend. Everyone had to express their love for 
                the King and his wisdom and burn their clothes. If the police 
                suspected that you were holding back on any clothes, then you 
                risked having your house burnt down and your genitals mutilated.&quot;<p>
                Primrose stroked the tangled hairs of Tracey's cunt. &quot;My 
                gosh! This has been well used!&quot; she commented looking at 
                a cunt torn inside out after years of promiscuity. &quot;You'll 
                have to keep this cut short too. They don't like pubic hair obscuring 
                anything. That's also illegal.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Should we shave it all off like you and Tiger Lilly?&quot; 
                wondered Sharon who quite fancied the idea.<p>
                &quot;Well, we're teachers and we're expected to shave our pubes. 
                Different classes and statuses have different rules, you know. 
                Most peasants in this country are never allowed to shave their 
                pubic hair, and no way could you pass off as a peasant. You're 
                too well-fed for a start, and there are no calluses on your fingers. 
                And you obviously wear shoes most of the time, judging from your 
                tender soles.&quot;<p>
                After the girls had put on the blouses, which were slightly too 
                tight, Primrose took them down to the small dining room where 
                they met Tiger Lilly again, and Chrysanthemum. She was the other 
                teacher who lived in the cottage. The two teachers were watching 
                the flickering black and white pictures on a small television. 
                It was, of course, screening Buggery Broadcasting Television.<p>
                Chrysanthemum was stunningly beautiful, but she wore no clothes, 
                her straight blonde hair reached to her bottom and like the others 
                she had shaved her pubic hair, but also everywhere else as well. 
                When she stood up, she revealed that she was quite tall and sported 
                an unbelievably perfect set of teeth. &quot;Welcome to our humble 
                home,&quot; she smiled broadly and reassuringly. <p>
                Tiger Lilly was holding Chrysanthemum's hand, but looked rather 
                less beautiful than her lover. She had a broken nose and long 
                crooked scar across her stomach. She smiled with rather less warmth 
                than either of the other two. &quot;What do you think of Buggery?&quot; 
                she asked.<p>
                &quot;The television's funny,&quot; commented Sharon.<p>
                &quot;That's almost entirely for the benefit of the Royal Academy,&quot; 
                laughed Chrysanthemum. &quot;The moral centre of our society, 
                if you like. It's only at the Royal Academies and their grounds 
                that anyone is ever really like the people on television in the 
                way they dress. And nowhere in the Kingdom is real life like what 
                they show.&quot;<p>
                &quot;It's all a fantasy world,&quot; added Primrose, who was 
                aware of the girls' confusion. &quot;It's just to tell us what 
                the ideals of our society are supposed to be. Nobody's really 
                like that!&quot;<p>
                &quot;But what about the people who appear on it?&quot;<p>
                &quot;What about the people who service tourists at Pederasty 
                and all the other tourist centres in this country?&quot; retorted 
                Primrose. &quot;There are a lot of different trades and professions. 
                Some of those like acting, or serving at the Royal Palace, or 
                working for the police force, or entertaining tourists, are so 
                specialised that they have different schools, different ethics, 
                different places to live, different expectations and so on.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Like teachers,&quot; suggested Tracey. <p>
                &quot;Well, almost,&quot; conceded Primrose. &quot;I can only 
                teach in the kind of school I was taught in, though I do have 
                the unusual freedom to mix with people who teach in different 
                schools, and who were themselves taught in those kind of schools.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Most of the people round here in this borough are what you 
                might call ordinary people,&quot; smiled Chrysanthemum. She was 
                always smiling. Tracey felt a curiously warm feeling and was wondering 
                whether she was already falling in love with the woman. &quot;This 
                is a very ordinary area.&quot;<p>
                &quot;80% peasant, of which 50% are given the opportunity to progress 
                at school to the extent that they will always be dissatisfied 
                with their lot. 20% middle-class, of which 50% will be automatically 
                demoted to peasant if they aren't seen to conform sufficiently. 
                Within each group, slightly different standards of dress and behaviour 
                so you know exactly what you're standing is in society.&quot;<p>
                &quot;That's all fucking well, Primrose,&quot; sniffed Tiger Lilly. 
                &quot;What are we going to do with these tourists? Chain them 
                down and rape them? Tether them to fucking stakes?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Don't be so vulgar, Tiger Lilly dearest,&quot; exclaimed 
                Chrysanthemum, but with an indulgent smile. &quot;I'm sure the 
                girls will be quite happy to have sex with you without being forced 
                to.&quot;<p>
                &quot;We'll just give them a night's sleep and set them off to 
                Gomorrah,&quot; explained Primrose.<p>
                &quot;Gomorrah!&quot; gasped Sharon. &quot;Isn't Buggery at war 
                with Gomorrah?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Who fucking isn't!&quot; expostulated Tiger Lilly.<p>
                &quot;If you go back to Throb, you risk being arrested, raped 
                and mutilated for straying out of the tourist areas. If you stay 
                here, you'll eventually be found, arrested, raped and mutilated 
                for being terrorists. If you try to get to the Embassy districts, 
                you'll be arrested, raped and mutilated as spies. You're probably 
                going to get killed whatever you do! Buggery's not a very good 
                place for foreigners. The Royal Government doesn't want the rest 
                of the world to know what the country is like, except where its 
                attracts tourism, and then almost exclusively to sell sex. They'll 
                kill you to prevent you telling anyone what it's like here. They 
                would prefer to continue to be criticised for the questionable 
                nature of the sex on offer, than for how most people live here. 
                If you get to Gomorrah, you might at least be protected as a propaganda 
                weapon by the Gomorrans.&quot;<p>
                Sharon shivered. This was worse than she'd feared. &quot;Is it 
                really that bad?&quot;<p>
                Tiger Lilly smiled grimly. &quot;I don't know what you thought 
                Buggery would be, but Paradise it fucking well isn't!&quot;<p>
                The teachers prepared a dinner for the five of them which consisted 
                mostly of vegetables and rice. &quot;All local produce!&quot; 
                announced Chrysanthemum proudly.<p>
                &quot;Well, actually local produce is all we can buy,&quot; qualified 
                Primrose. <p>
                The television was left on with the sound turned down. It was 
                screening a scene of a man masturbating into a cup: an exercise 
                somehow associated with a cookery programme.<p>
                &quot;I teach at the local Secondary School,&quot; Primrose went 
                on, &quot;so I get the best selection of local produce from my 
                pupils. They seem to think that if they give me things, they might 
                do better in their exams; but since they all bring me things, 
                none of them could possibly have an advantage over another.&quot;<p>
                &quot;What's the school like?&quot; wondered Tracey, who hadn't 
                really attended school very much when she was a schoolgirl. She'd 
                spent most days playing truant with the boys, with whom she'd 
                wander the streets or go somewhere to indulge in drink, drugs, 
                cigarettes and sex.<p>
                &quot;It's a fairly ordinary school, by Buggery standards. But 
                I imagine it's quite different from where you come from. The central 
                doctrine of Buggery society is that all the people of Buggery 
                be in a state of humiliation imposed on them by the King. It is 
                an expression of the people's utter obedience and servility to 
                the Crown and is instilled from the earliest age. Part of the 
                humiliation of course is that it is progressive, so before the 
                children come to Secondary School they have never known sexual 
                humiliation or indeed cruelty of any kind.<p>
                &quot;Primary schools in Buggery are kept quite separate from 
                the rest of society, and no adults (except teachers) are ever 
                allowed there. Most of us can only ever remember them distantly, 
                and as we start secondary school education at eight our memories 
                of them become disjointed. All I know, is that children who leave 
                Primary School are totally unprepared for Secondary School. Not 
                everyone joins Secondary School, but those who do are well and 
                fit. When they leave Primary School they are allocated to 'parents' 
                according to eugenic principles. Nobody really knows who their 
                real parents are, as breeding centres, like Primary schools, are 
                hidden away somewhere out of sight.<p>
                &quot;The 'parents' send them to Secondary School and are obliged 
                by law to give the children as much care and attention as they 
                can. The 'parents' are officially only allowed a certain degree 
                of parental abuse (but that's one of the few things that isn't 
                very well enforced) and these must only take place at certain 
                festivals. The children stay at school until they are in a position 
                to either graduate, in which case they leave the district, or 
                to be turned to work. Most (perhaps 80% of them) will become peasants 
                in this area and in turn become assigned 'parents'. If they become 
                pregnant, they will be sent to the breeding centres, and as often 
                as not they never return. <p>
                &quot;School children must dress according to strict dress conventions, 
                which must reflect the general dress code of the district and 
                their position in class (which is often different to those of 
                their parents). The main criteria of distinction are clothes, 
                hair-length, pubic hair and jewellery. Girls and boys are dressed 
                and treated identically. No allowances are made for their different 
                sexuality, even during sex classes. In my school, and I'm sure 
                there are similar rules elsewhere, the higher grading a child 
                has then the longer the hair, the shorter the pubic hair, the 
                more clothes and jewellery. The top pupil then has very long hair, 
                no pubic hair, plenty of jewellery and the maximum amount of clothes 
                permitted within the rules of this district. The lowest grade 
                pupils, of which there are several, have their heads shaved, an 
                untidy bush of pubic hair, no clothes and only a large steel cunt-ring. 
                <p>
                &quot;The pupils are evaluated according to a number of factors 
                which include physical appearance, physical fitness, academic 
                brightness, good behaviour and sexual performance. The top pupils 
                are granted special privileges such as a more generous food allowance, 
                exemption from certain of the daily humilities such as arse-licking 
                and orgy practice. The lowest pupils would almost consider such 
                humilities as privileges. They can be, and are, treated badly 
                by all pupils with the teachers leading by example. They are to 
                be shat on, pissed on, buggered, beaten up, whipped, etc. The 
                justification is that this is to encourage these pupils to pull 
                themselves together. Instead most leave the school altogether 
                and some kill themselves. This is not considered to be a cause 
                for much regret or sorrow. <p>
                &quot;As teachers we are obliged to conduct the daily humiliations, 
                which include random buggery, cold showers and the ritual tearing 
                up of pupils' clothes. Any excuse for punishing the pupils must 
                be taken enthusiastically, and punishment will only stop after 
                the requisite amount of blood has been shed. Pupils try to avoid 
                punishment because if their physical beauty is impaired in any 
                way they may drop a grade and begin the long slide towards the 
                bottom.<p>
                &quot;The reason for all this humility is to show respect towards 
                the King. This is best illustrated during the festivals on national 
                and local holidays, which can be quite frequent when the country 
                is deemed to be doing particularly well at the war. Otherwise, 
                they mostly mark birthdays and anniversaries associated with the 
                Royal Family. For each festival, there is usually a specific ceremony 
                or rite which must be performed. In many cases these are just 
                species of orgy. In some cases, pupils have to demonstrate their 
                sexual skills to other pupils, which may include being buggered 
                by fellow pupils or giving blow jobs to members of staff. One 
                not very pleasant ceremony to mark a victory over the Sodomites 
                in the last Sodomite War involved pupils eating each others' turds 
                and drinking their piss. There was a lot of illness the following 
                day; and inevitably some of it was fatal.<p>
                &quot;The King is praised during formal ceremonies at five intervals 
                during the day. On arrival at school, the pupils must close their 
                eyes and masturbate the pupil nearest to them to show their desire 
                for the King. The next occasion is when the pupils listen to a 
                Television Broadcast given by a representative of the King which 
                outlines any new duties and responsibilities. They must meditate 
                on this. The third occasion is the arse-licking ceremony where 
                after cleaning their bottoms, they must lick clean the arse of 
                another pupil. This demonstrates the need for thorough arse-cleaning. 
                Some pupils are not popular for the state of their arses. The 
                fourth occasion is the school orgy, where selected pupils have 
                sex with each other and the rest of the school observe. This is 
                important for the pupils, as their grading depends on their sexual 
                performance. The fifth observation at the end of the school day 
                is to kiss the penis of the statue of the King outside the school 
                as they leave. Some to show their greater love, will, of course, 
                insert their anuses or vaginas over the penis.<p>
                &quot;The academic classes are much like those in the schools 
                in your country I imagine, though the pupils are obliged to take 
                their clothes off in Regal Studies, Physical Education, Sex Education, 
                Games and Biology. Regal Studies is where they learn about the 
                events in the King's life, the history of the Royal Family and 
                are taught about his great wisdom and sayings. During this class, 
                the students have chains attached to their cunt-rings which are 
                attached at the other end to the teacher's cunt-ring. I can tell 
                you this is a very uncomfortable lesson for me to have to teach.&quot;<p>
                &quot;The contrast with the Royal Academy where I teach couldn't 
                be greater,&quot; smiled Chrysanthemum. &quot;The girls, (and 
                they are all girls) are taught to worship the King, but are not 
                taught humiliation. Merely obedience. The world the Academy girls 
                are told about is one like that of the Buggery Broadcasting Corporation 
                TV programmes. In fact, the only place that I know of where life 
                at all resembles that shown on television is at the Academy. All 
                the girls at the Royal Academy are groomed for future work at 
                the Royal Court and consequently they are amongst the few people 
                in this country who stand much likelihood of ever seeing His Majesty 
                in the flesh. As opposed to on the many billboards and in the 
                form of officially approved statues and portraits.<p>
                &quot;According to the strict Eugenic practices of Buggery society, 
                enforced rigidly from birth, only the best girls are ever likely 
                to go to the Royal Academies. Even the primary schools they attend 
                are segregated from the rest of the country. The girls in the 
                Royal Academy know nothing about the rest of Buggery, beyond what 
                they see on television. I don't think they'd like it if they did 
                see it, but it's unlikely they would ever miss it. The school 
                grounds where they live are very large and very beautiful. Most 
                people in Buggery never get to see such beautiful woodland, fields, 
                lakes and gardens as those surrounding the Academy. And although 
                the girls are prohibited from passing through the Academy's perimeters, 
                very few of them are ever likely to be tempted to do so.<p>
                &quot;School at the Royal Academy is made as pleasant as possible. 
                The girls are kept innocent of many things that might seem bizarre 
                to you foreigners. They know nothing about clothes, and as you 
                can see from watching television they wouldn't know about clothes 
                from there either. They all have very long hair and they all shave 
                their pubic hairs. Only the very few pupils of black or oriental 
                origin shave their heads (and this is mandatory) but they are 
                not discriminated against and are treated very kindly. If not 
                indulgently.<p>
                &quot;The girls are taught academic subjects, physical education 
                and Regal studies just like at other schools in Buggery, but Sex 
                Education is always only conducted between themselves. That is, 
                the girls are expected and very much encouraged to make love with 
                each other. The incentive for this is a certain competitiveness 
                to gain prestige and a good reputation, but this is not reflected 
                by any difference in how the girls are treated. Certainly not 
                in the brutal way they are at Primrose's school. The black and 
                oriental girls are particularly popular for sex games because 
                of their curiosity value.<p>
                &quot;As a teacher I am expected to make love to the girls. This 
                I have to do several times a day: usually outside in the gardens 
                and always with other girls watching. I also have to make love 
                with the male members of staff. These are the only men the girls 
                ever meet. The men are not permitted to have sex with the girls 
                and are solely there to demonstrate heterosexual sex, without 
                which the girls would really have no idea what to do when they 
                attend the Royal Courts. I have sex with a man, in a variety of 
                different positions, at least twice a day, with the girls watching 
                and clapping. Unlike Primrose's school, there's not much anal 
                intercourse but I do have to provide the occasional special performance. 
                Although the men are not permitted to have sex with the girls, 
                they are expected to have sex with each other as well as the women 
                teachers. I can't complain about the men. They are all very attractive 
                and they are all very good at making love. They are not allowed 
                to do anything else, and they sleep well away from the girls. 
                The reason for this is that the girls must be technically virgins: 
                at least in the sense that their maidenheads must remain intact 
                when they leave the school and go to the Royal Court.<p>
                &quot;It's a very pleasant life for the girls at the Royal Academy. 
                I really cannot complain about the privilege I have of working 
                there. It's also of course the kind of school I went to. I don't 
                know what happens to the girls when they get to the Royal Court, 
                but they are certainly well-groomed for the status they are expected 
                to maintain.&quot;<p>
                &quot;It's not so nice at the fucking Police School,&quot; commented 
                Tiger Lilly. &quot;Not at all so fucking nice. Not even as nice 
                as Primrose's pissing nancy school. The pupils, girls or boys, 
                come straight from primary school and then we make them. We give 
                them a body they're going to be fucking proud of,&quot; she flexed 
                her own muscles, &quot;we teach them respect for the King and 
                how to get others to respect the King.<p>
                &quot;When I'm in the classroom, the pupils have to do what the 
                fuck I tell them. If that means a few bones get broken or your 
                skin gets torn, well fuck it! The pupils have to accept I'll fuck 
                them whenever I went, wherever I want, whether they're boys or 
                girls.&quot; Tiger Lilly waved her plastic truncheon which Sharon 
                could now see was in actual fact a double-ended dildo. &quot;I 
                expect a good fuck from each of my pupils. There are no fucking 
                grades at Police School. You're either in or you're fucking out 
                and fuck you!<p>
                &quot;We show them how to be good police. The ways to fuck people 
                and fuck them up if they're any fucking trouble. We show them 
                torture and we teach them the law.&quot;<p>
                &quot;It's by having a brutal police force,&quot; Primrose explained 
                reassuringly, &quot;that people in Buggery learn how to support 
                the Royal Government. You put a toe out of line and you're tortured, 
                mutilated and, if you're lucky, killed.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Fucking right we're brutal,&quot; agreed Tiger Lilly proudly. 
                &quot;No fucking bastard can say no to me. I'll fucking tear out 
                his or her genitals and eat them in front of them. I've done that 
                before now. I'll shove this thing so high up their rear end it 
                pops out their fucking mouth. I'll kick them and beat them so 
                fucking hard and then get them pleading for more. You can't keep 
                people down without a bit of brutality.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Don't worry about Tiger Lilly,&quot; smiled Chrysanthemum. 
                &quot;She's not going to torture you two, but, on the other hand, 
                if she wants sex with you I wouldn't argue.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Too fucking right you won't!&quot; Tiger Lilly agreed.<p>
                &quot;There are other kinds of schools,&quot; elaborated Primrose. 
                &quot;There are schools for actors, which are much more like Chrysanthemum's 
                school than mine. There are schools for tourism. In fact, there's 
                one not far from Pederasty where you were, which teaches all the 
                boys there how to do their trade.&quot;<p>
                &quot;What happens,&quot; wondered Sharon, &quot;to these boys 
                if they didn't feel like having sex with a tourist? You know because 
                they feel a bit off or something?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I'd be surprised,&quot; said Primrose a little grimly, &quot;if 
                there are many occasions they actually do want sex with a tourist. 
                It's just what they're trained to do and if they don't do it well 
                then they're out.&quot;<p>
                &quot;What happens to them then?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Nobody knows. I don't know what'd happen to me if it was 
                decided I couldn't teach anymore. All we know is that people eventually 
                vanish. They get arrested by police, they go to the breeding centres, 
                they get called up to fight in whatever war there is, they go 
                to hospital. And then they never come back. We don't know what 
                happens, but all the rumours are fairly unpleasant.&quot;<p>
                Sharon didn't like the sound of any of these accounts of life 
                in Buggery, She glanced at Tracey, who was nervously clasping 
                and unclasping her fingers, and looking rather depressed. Her 
                head was down and her eyes seemed to be focused on the ragged 
                edges of the rug on the cottage floor. Sharon faced Primrose, 
                who she thought was the most sympathetic to the girls' plight. 
                &quot;What are we going to do?&quot; she pleaded.<p>
                &quot;You're not fucking staying here,&quot; said Tiger Lilly 
                bluntly.<p>
                &quot;I'm afraid that's true,&quot; agreed Primrose. &quot;You're 
                going to have to get moving. And soon! It'll be dangerous though. 
                If you get caught by the police you'll almost certainly be as 
                good as dead so you'll have to avoid being seen by them at all 
                costs.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Should we go disguised as something?&quot; Tracey asked. 
                &quot;Are there people who can wander anywhere in this country?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well, yes,&quot; considered Primrose. &quot;The Sodomite 
                Pilgrims can wander anywhere in this country and they're never 
                troubled.&quot; <p>
                &quot;So, should we dress as Sodomite pilgrims?&quot;<p>
                &quot;What a fucking joke!&quot; chortled Tiger Lilly.<p>
                &quot;I wouldn't,&quot; shuddered Chrysanthemum. &quot;Sodomite 
                Pilgrims come from Sodom. They come here to visit the sites in 
                this country which are considered significant in the history of 
                Sodomy. This is usually as a result of their various wars with 
                Buggery over the centuries. I don't know much about Sodom. And 
                I don't think anyone in Buggery does. Sodom doesn't even have 
                the tourism you find in this country. But if the Sodomite Pilgrims 
                are anything to go by, Sodom is probably an even more unattractive 
                country than this.<p>
                &quot;Sodomite priests are almost all women but some are men. 
                They wear no clothes but chains which are threaded into their 
                noses, genitals and other places. Their heads are shaved and they 
                have tattoos on their faces which seem to indicate their status. 
                They travel from town to town, village to village begging for 
                food as they go. When they arrive at a place of worship they lie 
                face down to the ground with their bottoms to the air. They then 
                invite passing people to bugger them or to insert things into 
                their anuses.<p>
                &quot;Sodom must be a very brutal country. The women have their 
                vaginas sewn together so that nothing can enter them, and when 
                they piss it squirts uncontrollably down their legs. Many of their 
                rituals seem to involve drinking each other's urine and eating 
                their faeces which they mostly do when people are watching. No 
                one has ever heard them speak because they all have their tongues 
                torn out, and in certain cases they have their hands removed so 
                that they only have stumps at the end of their arms. It's thought 
                that this is done so they can't tell anyone what they've seen 
                in Buggery (and if they can write, not to write it down), but 
                of course it also means they can't tell anyone in Buggery or elsewhere 
                about Sodom.<p>
                &quot;They seem to have a cult of violence. They always seem to 
                be beating and whipping each other. If it wasn't for the baldness, 
                tattoos, nudity and chains, a Sodomite pilgrim would be identified 
                by the broken nose, broken teeth, missing fingers and toes, and 
                all the horrible scars. Many of the scars seem to be on the buttocks 
                which they seem to be very enthusiastic about beating with whips 
                and sticks. They often seem distressed when people from Buggery 
                don't bugger them when they are covered in blood, piss and shit.<p>
                &quot;So, I wouldn't recommend you cut out your tongue and so 
                on to pretend to be a Sodomite Pilgrim. Nor, for that matter, 
                would I suggest visiting Sodom. Not many people cross the border 
                except Sodomite Pilgrims and I think they do because however awful 
                Buggery might be, Sodom must be much worse.&quot;<p>
                &quot;You'll have to dress as an ordinary citizen from Buggery,&quot; 
                recommended Primrose. &quot;This means we'll have to do something 
                about your hair and I'm afraid you won't be able to wear any jewellery 
                except a single cunt ring.&quot;<p>
                &quot;What'll happen to all our bangles and rings?&quot; wondered 
                Tracey, who despite the pain they'd given her today had grown 
                rather fond of them.<p>
                &quot;We'll keep them,&quot; announced Tiger Lilly brusquely.<p>
                &quot;I'm afraid we will. They're no use to you. And you don't 
                want anyone finding them on you.&quot; Primrose concurred.<p>
                After dinner, Sharon and Tracey sadly discarded their jewellery, 
                leaving a row of small holes in their nipples and labia. Primrose 
                let the girls keep the blouses she had lent them, but she still 
                insisted that they take not put them on yet. These had been left 
                to her by school pupils who had been demoted and therefore had 
                no further use for them. Chrysanthemum brushed their hair to a 
                less wild state and attached a little chain to a small plain ring 
                she threaded into the vulva. The two girls were given cloth bags 
                to carry their few possessions in, which Primrose said would be 
                much was less conspicuous than their beach bags.<p>
                The reason neither girl was allowed to put on their clothes was 
                because Tiger Lilly was insistent that she had sex with the two 
                of them. Chrysanthemum and Primrose agreed to watch, but said 
                that they'd had too much sex already that day to feel inclined 
                to participate themselves.<p>
                &quot;I'm so sore!&quot; complained Chrysanthemum, &quot;otherwise 
                I'd fuck you like a real expert.&quot;<p>
                &quot;I am a fucking expert,&quot; snorted Tiger Lilly proudly.<p>
                &quot;But a bit rough, dearest!&quot; complained Primrose. And 
                Tiger Lilly was indeed rough. Far more so than the boys at home. 
                She slapped them about the face and buttocks. Pushed her fist 
                right up their cunts. Pummelled their anuses with thrusts of her 
                muscular middle finger. Bit the nipples on their breasts so hard 
                that the girls wondered whether they might be bitten off. All 
                the while, Tiger Lilly grinned and occasionally plunged her fingers 
                into her own moist and cavernous cunt. Except for the odd grunt 
                and the occasional barked command, she said nothing to the girls: 
                especially nothing that could be construed as comforting. Then 
                she tied the dildo around her waist and buggered the two girls 
                so hard that they were pleading for her to stop. <p>
                &quot;Fuck no!&quot; Tiger Lilly retorted. &quot;I've only fucking 
                started.&quot; And indeed she had. When she had finished, Sharon's 
                nose was bleeding and one eye was swollen with the start of a 
                bruise. Tracey's bottom felt so red and sore, that she wasn't 
                sure how she could ever sit on it. The girls were then tied to 
                a tree outside the cottage, just by the well, near the goat who 
                was desultorily chewing on some hay. Their hands were tied together 
                behind them and their arms pulled up to a branch. One end of a 
                flexible rubber dildo was pushed unceremoniously into each girl's 
                cunt and their feet were tied together. It was cold outside, but 
                the girls had to stay in this uncomfortable position for an hour 
                or so. They were told to keep their tongues deep inside each others' 
                mouth on pain of being hit. By this time, they were so bruised 
                and battered that they gladly engaged in tiring tongue kissing 
                just to avoid the physical penalties which Tiger Lilly was so 
                keen on. <p>
                Eventually, Primrose came out of the cottage. She smiled weakly 
                while she untied them and then brought the two girls into the 
                house. She nursed their wounds and kissed the girls tenderly. 
                &quot;Don't worry about Tiger Lilly. She's used to being a bit 
                rougher than that, but if she hadn't liked you I don't think you'd 
                be alive now.&quot;<p>
                Sharon fingered her bruise. &quot;Won't this mean we'll be noticed 
                even more now?&quot; <p>
                &quot;Nonsense,&quot; Primrose laughed. &quot;We've got you up 
                as fairly ordinary if relatively privileged natives, and a few 
                bruises and scratches are hopefully going to make you look rather 
                less remarkable. After all, tourists don't normally get beaten 
                up in this country so no one's going to think that's what you 
                are.&quot;<p>
                &quot;How far is it to Gomorrah?&quot; wondered Tracey who was 
                wishing this day had never began.<p>
                &quot;Not near enough for you, I'm afraid&quot; smiled Primrose 
                sadly. She left the two girls naked on the bed where they were 
                left to feel the warm ache of their bruises and pains and the 
                warm moistness of their tears as they gathered in damp patches 
                on the pillow by their slumped and battered faces.
