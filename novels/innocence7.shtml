                In Which we learn about the pains of Humility; and Innocence leaves 
                Religious devotion and we rediscover the virtues of Chastity.<p>
                <p>
                When Sister Innocence had returned from Brook to her own Convent 
                she was to find that Sister Charity's bed in her room had been 
                taken by a new nun, Sister Humility, who seemed to take the literal 
                meaning of her Christian name very seriously indeed. In fact, 
                the first time Innocence met Sister Humility she was knelt down 
                on the floor with her robe pulled forward over her shoulders and 
                crouched on her feet, showing her bare back and her buttocks. 
                She was looking at Sisters Faith and Hope who were, unusually, 
                making love to each other without the cover of their bedsheets. 
                This was odd, Innocence thought. Perhaps Sister Humility had a 
                similar desire to masturbate as Sister Charity and a need for 
                voyeurism to intensify her feelings. However, her innocent interpretation 
                was soon disproved when with a sudden crack she saw Sister Humility's 
                hand pop up followed by a length of cord which slapped against 
                her back leaving a small trail of blood. Sister Humility was beating 
                herself. <p>
                When Sister Humility and the other two nuns noticed Sister Innocence 
                they greeted her, and politely finished what they were doing. 
                Sister Humility sat down on her bed, with her robe still gathered 
                up to her neck at the back but covering the whole of her body 
                at the front. For a woman who seemed to enjoy self-abuse she had 
                a curiously child-like face with open blue eyes and a tiny nose. 
                Sister Faith sat behind Sister Humility and tended to the fresh 
                wounds that she had which were lost on a back full of scars from 
                previous beatings which stretched from her neck to the top of 
                her thighs. The scars were at their deepest and most frequent 
                between the shoulders and on her buttocks. <p>
                Sister Innocence learnt that her new room-mate believed passionately 
                in mortification of the flesh as being the means towards salvation. 
                As a result of daily punishing her sinful lusts, she would purify 
                her soul such that at the Rapture the Lord's semen would arrive 
                in her uncontaminated by other lusts. She had persuaded Sisters 
                Faith and Hope, who cheerfully admitted an initial reluctance, 
                to help her in her self-mortification by emulating the lust that 
                she wished to ban from herself and which she believed she would 
                beat out of her. &quot;You can see,&quot; she admitted pointing 
                to the many scars on her back, &quot;that my thoughts have been 
                less than pure and have required a great deal of humbling.&quot; 
                <p>
                Innocence resisted pleas by her room-mates that she either help 
                Sister Humility in purging herself of her sinful carnal desires 
                by emulating masturbation or sex or purge herself of such sins 
                by similar self-mortification to that of Sister Humility. In fact, 
                now that Sister Charity had gone she felt curiously lonely in 
                the Convent. She realised now how much she'd needed Sister Charity's 
                friendship. <p>
                So, when she heard she had a visitor she at first thought and 
                hoped that it might be Sister Charity returning from Brook. This, 
                she admitted to herself, was unlikely as Sister Charity had seemed 
                almost deliriously happy in her new home when they parted with 
                a chaste kiss on the lips. She had made many new friends - many 
                of whom shared her belief in the rightness of masturbating to 
                thoughts of Christ's ultimate entry into their body and soul. 
                In Brook, Sister Charity's views were not at all eccentric. <p>
                Her visitor was in fact Kedi who Innocence hadn't seen since she'd 
                left Alice's home. She was dressed more demurely than Innocence 
                had ever seen her before - no doubt as a mark of respect for being 
                in a Convent. However, the white cloth over her breasts and around 
                her crotch didn't detract at all from the beauty of her otherwise 
                naked body. She sat waiting on a chair in the reception room with 
                her legs crossed and swinging her bare feet nonchalantly back 
                and forth. She grinned widely as Innocence came in and sat nervously 
                opposite her. <p>
                Kedi explained that she had come to visit Innocence partly on 
                the bidding of Chastity who was wondering how her sister was doing. 
                She and Chastity were living together at a house they were renting 
                in Wonderground near where Mouse and her parents lived, but she 
                had been visiting some friends in Brook and had stopped at the 
                Convent as it was en route. <p>
                &quot;I thought you'd still be living with Alice and Dinah,&quot; 
                commented Innocence. <p>
                &quot;Well, Alice was very jealous and possessive, was she not?&quot; 
                remarked Kedi. &quot;And it was very difficult when you and Chastity 
                have left because Alice started to get upset when Mouse began 
                to sleep with me. I thought I ought not to cause any more problems 
                and when Chastity has come to visit me and said we can live together 
                I didn't refuse.&quot; <p>
                &quot;How is Chastity?&quot; <p>
                &quot;Your sister seems very happy. Much happier than when we 
                have been together at Alice's. She says she is very much in love 
                with me. In fact she says she has never loved anyone as much as 
                she loves me now. But she says she loves you very much. And she 
                is very much thinking of you now. Are you happy?&quot; <p>
                Innocence nodded, but she felt that perhaps she didn't express 
                quite as much conviction as she might have done. Kedi gazed sympathetically 
                into Innocence's eyes and her grin took on a slightly sadder tinge. 
                <p>
                &quot;Do you think you like to be a nun? I have been very surprised 
                when I had been told you become a nun. It must be strange for 
                you.&quot; <p>
                &quot;Why strange?&quot; <p>
                &quot;With your special gift,&quot; Kedi said without embarrassment. 
                &quot;And the life you and Chastity have led together: it has 
                not been life like many nuns. Are you not supposed to be a virgin?&quot; 
                <p>
                &quot;I am a virgin!&quot; <p>
                &quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Kedi diplomatically. &quot;But Chastity 
                thinks that you must find it more difficult as one who has known 
                what it is like not to be a virgin or not very like one and to 
                be a nun. Are you sure you are happy?&quot; <p>
                Innocence nodded ferociously. &quot;As long as I serve my Lord 
                I am happy,&quot; she said fervently. <p>
                &quot;Why?&quot; <p>
                &quot;Because I know that when I die I shall be raised to Rapture 
                and he will enter me and possess me and cover me with his Holy 
                Semen and push his Holy Member deep inside me!&quot; <p>
                &quot;Won't that be painful for you!&quot; laughed Kedi. &quot;And 
                anyway I thought you have preferred the love of a woman.&quot; 
                <p>
                &quot;Jesus Christ the Lord is different,&quot; insisted Innocence. 
                <p>
                &quot;It is the first time I have heard that He is a woman,&quot; 
                smiled Kedi. <p>
                Kedi and Innocence continued talking in the reception room and 
                then, with the Mother Superior's permission the two went for a 
                walk in the woods around the Convent. As soon as Kedi felt that 
                they were out of sight, she took off her clothes which she complained 
                were uncomfortable and she walked along naked with Innocence holding 
                her clothes in one hand and her free arm around Innocence's waist. 
                Then, without warning, she let her clothes drop, wrapped her arms 
                around Innocence more passionately and pushed her tongue deep 
                inside Innocence's mouth. Taken aback Innocence reciprocated, 
                but then she struggled free. <p>
                &quot;I can't!&quot; she struggled. &quot;I'm saving myself for 
                the Lord!&quot; <p>
                &quot;And just what have you got left to save?&quot; asked Kedi, 
                not put off at all, putting her hands inside Innocence's gown 
                and grabbing her suddenly erect penis. <p>
                And so it was that Innocence found herself making love with incredible 
                passion with her sister's lover and as the sweat poured down her 
                breasts and the salt was licked off by Kedi's tongue, reflecting 
                on the commitment she still felt towards the Order. <p>
                &quot;Perhaps you should ask your Mother Superior to visit Chastity 
                and me,&quot; suggested Kedi afterwards as they sat naked in the 
                corner of a field by a small pond. &quot;If you still wish to 
                stay in the Order after you have stayed with us, then you will 
                know for sure the extent of your commitment to your faith.&quot; 
                <p>
                &quot;But I'll be misled!&quot; <p>
                Kedi laughed and licked Innocence's ear with her tongue. &quot;We 
                can only hope so!&quot; <p>
                Sister Innocence's Mother Superior was very saddened when Innocence 
                confessed to her doubts that serving the order was best for her 
                and accepted Kedi's advice that Innocence visit her sister and 
                her. &quot;We will of course pray for your soul and the hope that 
                whatever decision you make that you will be ready to receive the 
                Lord in Body and Soul at the Final Coming.&quot; Innocence nodded 
                meekly, and said that she hoped that the Lord would come over 
                all the members of the Convent at the Final Reckoning. Innocence 
                left Sisters Faith, Hope and Humility feeling uncertain as to 
                whether she'd ever see them again. She then rushed out and off 
                to the railway station as fast as she could to hold back her thoughts 
                and her tears. <p>
                Her train journey to Wonderground took her by train, but she knew 
                when she'd entered the district as the dress of the people there 
                were just as Kedi had described. The men wore double-breasted 
                suits and the women nothing but stockings, suspenders and stilettos, 
                except for thick scarves which covered most of their breasts and 
                large floppy hats which covered most of their faces. The quite 
                disturbing effect Innocence found was that attention was diverted 
                to the vaginas of all the women. None of these were shaved, as 
                had been an earlier fashion, but she could see that many women 
                had jewellery attached to them. Innocence felt as inappropriately 
                dressed as when she was visiting Brook, but then she was a nun 
                and in her order it would have been ostentatious to wear such 
                clothes. <p>
                Innocence used a street map supplied by Kedi to find her way through 
                the suburban tree-lined streets - each identical to the last - 
                to find her way to the house where her sister and her lover were 
                staying. As she walked her flat sandals assisted her stride substantially 
                better than the teetering heels of most other women. When she 
                found the house, it was just one of many in a suburban terrace 
                distinguishable most by the poorer state of the paint on the front 
                door and a poster sellotaped to the inside of a window demanding 
                equal rights for blacks. &quot;Is this it?&quot; wondered Innocence 
                checking the number of the house against the address Kedi had 
                supplied her and then ringing the door-bell. A muffled farting 
                noise signalled some rustling inside and the pushing aside of 
                a few locks. Then as the door opened she saw her sister dressed 
                herself in the stilettos, suspenders and stockings of the district, 
                but otherwise typically naked. Her hair was tied back into a ponytail 
                and flopped over her shoulder down to her breasts. <p>
                &quot;Come in! Come in!&quot; Her sister said hurriedly and then 
                fussed her into the living room. Innocence sat down in a slightly 
                worn armchair just by the gas fire and just opposite a large but 
                battered television. &quot;Make yourself at home, and take off 
                some of your clothes.&quot; Innocence took off her wymple to reveal 
                her shaved head which alarmed Chastity. &quot;What have they done 
                to you?&quot; She shrieked. &quot;You look terrible! Why don't 
                you put on some other clothes?&quot; <p>
                &quot;I don't have any other clothes,&quot; replied Innocence 
                honestly. <p>
                &quot;They haven't been mistreating you, have they?&quot; <p>
                &quot;Of course not.&quot; <p>
                &quot;But your hair...&quot; <p>
                &quot;I chose to sacrifice my hair for the Lord.&quot; <p>
                &quot;Well, while you're here you can't dress like a nun.&quot; 
                <p>
                &quot;Why not! I can't go round naked, can I?&quot; <p>
                The two sisters chatted together, and Innocence became further 
                aware of the extent of her sister's incomprehension at her choice 
                of vocation. However, she came round to agree that it would be 
                inappropriate for her to dress like a nun while she was in a state 
                of indecision as to whether to remain one. When Kedi arrived, 
                dressed as always in nothing and making no concessions to the 
                fashion of the district, she suggested that Innocence stay naked 
                at home, but wear her gown when going out. Chastity tried to persuade 
                Innocence to dress more fashionably - at least to wear stilettos 
                and stockings - but Kedi sided with Innocence. &quot;If she do 
                not want to dress like that and if she wants to hide her gift 
                of the gods from curious strangers then she has every right to 
                do that.&quot; <p>
                As the days went by, Innocence began to feel her adherence to 
                her Holy Order was slipping past her. Perhaps, she considered, 
                her attachment needed the constant reinforcement of being with 
                other nuns and regular prayer. However if her faith could slip 
                so rapidly after such a brief respite it may be that Kedi and 
                her sister were right in saying that a religious vocation was 
                not for her. (Chastity seemed to think that those who practised 
                prostitution for Christ might be on to a good number, although 
                she didn't like the idea of not being able to veto who you made 
                love to.) At first, Innocence tried to resist the inevitable relaxation 
                of her behaviour, but it wasn't too long until she decided to 
                abandon wearing her gown altogether even though she continued 
                shaving her head as a mark of spiritual respects. She decided 
                to wear stockings and stilettos, but also opted to wear a dress 
                and knickers to cover her penis. This made her seem quite eccentric, 
                but not as eccentric as she might have seemed otherwise. She felt 
                a bit uncomfortable in the district, and felt that she wasn't 
                quite ready to be so immediately immersed in the world outside 
                the Convent. <p>
                She'd already succumbed to Kedi's advances, so she was unable 
                to resist making love to her each night which Chastity initially 
                seemed not to mind. &quot;What matters is that my darling sister 
                is happy!&quot; she professed. After a while, Chastity seemed 
                to get restless about her lover dividing her time so diplomatically 
                between the two sisters. &quot;I love you both,&quot; she complained, 
                &quot;but I get less than half of your attention.&quot; <p>
                She gradually tried enticing Innocence into making love to her, 
                but her sister resisted her attentions quite firmly. In fact Innocence 
                became quite forceful in physically pushing her sister off her 
                as she transferred her tongue from Kedi's vagina to the penis 
                that was energetically thrusting into it. &quot;When I make love 
                to you,&quot; Innocence declared, &quot;is the time I will definitely 
                have left the Order.&quot; <p>
                This time inevitably came, and when Chastity's mouth met her sister's 
                and she wasn't pushed aside she knew that Innocence had left her 
                religious vocation behind her. She hid her thoughts from her sister 
                as Innocence's penis entered her for the first time that a penis 
                had entered her at all since she'd left Une's lovers behind. She 
                trembled as Innocence thrust away at her remembering their love 
                sessions in the past and Chastity's little preferences. She orgasmed 
                with a frightening intensity as Kedi and Innocence brought her 
                to one, then two, then three and finally four climaxes. She shrivelled 
                away with postcoital exhaustion and predicted to herself that 
                the following day her sister wouldn't be shaving her head. <p>
                And this indeed was what happened, but Innocence had made another 
                decision. She brushed her hand over the stubble on her head sitting 
                on a chair with no clothes on and staring over at Kedi and Chastity 
                who were sitting close together naked but for Chastity's stockings. 
                &quot;I'm returning to Brook!&quot; she announced. <p>
                &quot;Returning?&quot; wondered Chastity. <p>
                &quot;I don't want to stay here,&quot; Innocence announced. &quot;I 
                need to go somewhere somehow more pure. Somewhere with simple 
                principles.&quot; <p>
                &quot;And you think you'll find them in Brook!&quot; Scoffed Chastity. 
                &quot;You're just as unlikely to find salvation or whatever you 
                want in Brook as in a Convent. Brook is nothing more nor less 
                than a naturist's paradise. You surely don't believe that nudity 
                solves anything or makes things better?&quot; <p>
                Kedi sniffed. Her own attitude towards clothes was culturally 
                determined but no less firmly felt for that. &quot;If Innocence 
                thinks Brook is the district where she is to be happiest, then 
                she must go!&quot; she opined. &quot;It is a more good place than 
                here. The people are more honest and more open.&quot; <p>
                Innocence knew very little about such things as her only real 
                experiences of Brook were the Convent there and her reunion with 
                Purity - but these had impressed her. Perhaps she could find herself 
                in Brook like her schoolfriend lover had. &quot;I'm sure it will 
                be good for me. And I must get away from everyone I know and think 
                for myself.&quot; <p>
                Chastity smiled indulgently. &quot;I'll lend you some money to 
                start off with,&quot; she agreed. &quot;But you'll have to get 
                a job while you're there.&quot; Chastity was earning good money 
                in her job in a shop selling computers, video and audio equipment, 
                and this together with Kedi's earnings as a street sex entertainer 
                and some office cleaning made just enough for them to have saved 
                enough money to be relatively generous. &quot;When are you leaving?&quot; 
                <p>
                &quot;As soon as I can!&quot; Innocence announced, stroking the 
                unshaven hairs of her legs. She sipped slowly from her cup of 
                coffee. &quot;I just feel I've got to get moving!&quot; </p>
