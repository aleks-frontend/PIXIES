              <p> Buttercup sat down cross-legged, and the two other girls sat 
                down beside her: Tracey stretched out on the ragged grass and 
                Sharon with her knees pulled up to her chin. &quot;I enjoyed school. 
                I was good at lessons and was always amongst the best girls in 
                the sex lessons. We all looked forward to the day when we'd go 
                to the Royal Court and meet His Royal Highness. Our only dreams 
                were to be fucked by the King and maybe his Queen. We masturbated 
                every day in Regal Studies over his image and believed that he 
                would be the greatest lover in the world.<p>
                &quot;When we were fifteen, just two years ago, our school years 
                were over. Most girls (the ones we didn't think were so lucky) 
                were taken out of school to become teachers, actresses or sex 
                hostesses for the tourist industry. We thought we were the blessed 
                ones as we were packed together in luxury carriages in such a 
                frenzy of excitement to head to the world behind the wall.&quot;<p>
                Buttercup sighed, and then smiled broadly at Tracey. &quot;Oh! 
                It's so good to meet some friendly faces. I've not met anyone 
                since I escaped. I thought I'd never meet anyone. How long have 
                you been in the woods?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Too fucking long!&quot; grunted Sharon.<p>
                &quot;What was it like behind the wall?&quot; asked Tracey, somehow 
                too shy too use perjoratives as freely as her friend.<p>
                &quot;We'd been told what to expect. It would be such a glorious 
                place to be and above all we would have the privilege of serving 
                at the Royal Court. We'd lose our virginity, and then we'd live 
                in a world of luxury several times greater than that we'd been 
                used to.<p>
                &quot;At first when we'd arrived behind the wall, it seemed that 
                it was true. The degree of luxury the nobility enjoy is incredible. 
                As we were driven along we saw enormous palaces, gardens, swimming 
                pools, gold statues everywhere. It seemed like we'd died and gone 
                to heaven. The carriage stopped and we were escorted out of the 
                carriage by women wearing clothes. It was the first time in our 
                lives any of us had ever seen clothes. And it was a shock. The 
                entire concept of clothing had just never occurred to us. The 
                idea was so totally foreign. In actual fact, these women weren't 
                wearing that many clothes and what they were was all made of rubber. 
                They certainly didn't cover their groin or breasts, but they were 
                skin-tight. They also wore make-up (which we'd seen on television) 
                but not applied so thickly and unnaturally. Each of us were chaperoned 
                by a single woman who took us away from our friends. I've never 
                seen any of my friends from school ever again. <p>
                &quot;The woman who took me was quite rough. She took me into 
                a chamber and started making love to me in a loveless way I'd 
                never had love made to me before. When she'd finished, she washed 
                me with soap and cream in the most solicitous way. Then she announced 
                that I was officially classified as a Beta Plus. 'What does that 
                mean?' I asked. 'It means, my love, that you won't have your virginity 
                taken by the Royal Family. And certainly not by His Magnificent 
                Royal Highness (May He Live Forever)!' At that time there was 
                a different King. He certainly didn't live forever. 'Only Alpha 
                Plus girls get that privilege.' She said. 'But you're still very 
                lucky. You're assigned to the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, 
                His Grandiloquence, The Baron of White Flower.' And indeed that's 
                where I did go. And nobody ever told me that sex could be so horrible!&quot;<p>
                Buttercup paused and smiled again. Tracey was sure she was smiling 
                at her, and she felt herself blushing. What was happening to her? 
                She smiled back at Buttercup, feeling her face crack in a newly 
                unaccustomed way. When did she last smile? &quot;What do you mean: 
                he was horrible?&quot;<p>
                &quot;He was with me for about two hours with two other girls 
                who'd also just graduated. I was slapped, beaten, buggered, and 
                had my maidenhead taken. And in the most brutal and careless way. 
                Nothing like the pampered sensitive way I'd been told it would 
                be. Afterwards I was covered with bruises! I had raw red marks 
                down my back where he'd beaten me with a stick. But at least I 
                hadn't had a chair broken on my head like one girl who was knocked 
                unconscious and had her nose broken. And I didn't have one of 
                my hands sliced off with a carving knife like the other girl. 
                There was blood everywhere! And while this was all happening, 
                we were watched by an audience of the Baron's court and friends. 
                And they all applauded his most gross actions. The most foul and 
                disgusting, the more they were cheering him. I was so humiliated 
                and bewildered. No one had told me it would be like this!&quot;<p>
                Buttercup sighed deeply as she remembered these painful hours. 
                Despite herself, Tracey found a small tear drip out of the corner 
                of her eye. Who could ever treat such a beautiful girl so badly? 
                <p>
                &quot;Perhaps it was because I was so violently sick. My vomit 
                was everywhere. And I'd even shat from fright. Would I be the 
                next one to lose an arm? Or worse? Maybe it was because the Baron 
                had had his fill with the other two that I came off relatively 
                lightly.<p>
                &quot;When I went to bed after my first night, I just cried and 
                cried. I was assigned a pleasant enough chamber which I shared 
                with the other two girls who'd been with me and the Baron. The 
                girl with the broken nose just lay there with her eyes closed 
                and shivered. I wondered if she'd ever wake up. The other just 
                sat on a chair with her eyes wide open staring at her bandaged 
                bloody stump, shaking backwards and forwards. And backwards and 
                forwards. And from that moment, I swore I'd do whatever possible 
                to escape from that world.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Do you want to come to Gomorrah with us, then?&quot; Tracey 
                asked.<p>
                Buttercup looked deep into Tracey's eyes with a directness and 
                a love which melted her away to her core. Was she falling in love 
                with a woman? She coughed nervously. No woman, however beautiful, 
                could be better than cock. &quot;Can I, please?&quot; Buttercup 
                asked. &quot;I don't want to be a burden.&quot;<p>
                Tracey could hardly answer. She nodded her head under Buttercup's 
                spell. It was left to Sharon to answer. &quot;The more's the merrier,&quot; 
                she said supporting Tracey around the waist. &quot;Of course you 
                fucking can!&quot;<p>
                Buttercup knelt in front of the two girls and stretched an arm 
                out onto Tracey's knee. The hand was warm and firm, and Tracey 
                shuddered. &quot;I'd be so grateful!&quot; Buttercup pleaded, 
                her hand stroking up and down Tracey's thigh which burned from 
                the feel of it (or was it from all the scratches and bruises she 
                had?) And then, sensing a lack of resistance, Buttercup leaned 
                further forward and with her other stroked Tracey's arm, while 
                her first hand slid towards the battered and bruised and itching 
                vagina. And then, Tracey didn't know how, Buttercup's fingers 
                were firmly grasping her cunt, while Sharon's arm was around her 
                back, and Buttercup's lips parted slowly and sensuously. And then 
                they were on her mouth, and a warm melting liquid kiss melded 
                itself on her own passionate kisses.<p>
                Sharon sniffed as she watched Buttercup make love to her friend, 
                taking her arm off Tracey, as the two girls sank onto the grass. 
                Three, or was it four, days since they'd had sex, suddenly here 
                was Tracey getting all fucking soppy with a girl they'd only just 
                met. It was by no means the first time she'd watched her friend 
                having sex with someone else, even a woman, but she couldn't recall 
                her being so weirdly soppy and awkward about it. But there was 
                no way she could deny how beautiful Buttercup was. She felt strangely 
                hot herself, but she reminded herself it was cock she preferred. 
                She wasn't a fucking dyke. Even when Buttercup's other hand somehow 
                found its way to her own cunt, and she too, despite her tiredness 
                and exhaustion, melted into a sensuous pleasure that no one had 
                given her before. No one at home. No one in Throb. Not even the 
                man on the beach with the ten inch prick with the slight kink 
                in it. Nor the two men at the club who'd fucked her for well over 
                two hours. And none of the women she'd had, even Tracey (in fact 
                especially not Tracey) had made her feel like this before. She 
                gasped and panted as the three girls stroked and licked and grappled 
                with each other in the dappled light of the forest clearing, her 
                cunt burning with a heat that was only matched by the fury of 
                her orgasm as it erupted unprompted from inside her. She choked 
                and coughed and then collapsed onto the ground, watching through 
                her slightly opened eyes as Tracey and Buttercup dry humped each 
                other amongst the bluebells and mossy dew.<p>
                Eventually, after the most blissful rest either of the friends 
                had had since Throb, intertwined amongst each other, it was necessary 
                to start walking. Which they did silently and somehow overwhelmed 
                by the change of circumstances. Tracey and Sharon led, following 
                the route indicated so indistinctly on the map, with glimpses 
                of the wall visible in the distance. <p>
                It was Buttercup who broke the uneasy silence and asked the two 
                girls all sorts of questions about the holiday experience that 
                they had enjoyed before absconding. &quot;It was fucking magic!&quot; 
                exclaimed Sharon, reminiscing of the men who'd fucked her and 
                their days of luxurious depravity.<p>
                &quot;It's a bit like that behind the wall in a way,&quot; Buttercup 
                explained, pushing aside a low hanging branch that threatened 
                to scratch her face. &quot;Only there, it's done wholly for the 
                benefit of the aristocracy and favoured ministers. And by all 
                accounts, their tastes are somewhat more depraved than you ever 
                saw on your holiday. It's all very sadomasochistic and violent. 
                The boys are the ones who get the roughest treatment, I think. 
                There's a kind of homosexual bias amongst the inner court. The 
                lifespan for a servant is not very long. And almost everyone who's 
                not related to royalty is a servant. All you've got to do is attract 
                someone's attention by being too attractive, growing old, having 
                an injury, or just being there, and then you'll just somehow disappear. 
                It might be after some sex game or other. Or you might just get 
                sent off to the front. It's the men who get the worst of this, 
                and so there aren't many men behind the wall.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Are these Barons and Lords and so on really rich?&quot; 
                wondered Sharon who had always been fascinated by the lives of 
                the rich and famous. At home she'd often read magazine articles 
                about the eccentricities and depravities of millionaires and rock 
                stars.<p>
                &quot;I got to know a little about them while I was there, from 
                talking to people. And although luxury's all I've ever known really, 
                I'd say that they must be very rich. The nobility have gardens, 
                mansions, palaces and so forth which are truly astonishing. There's 
                so much of it. It's quite easy to get lost in the grounds and 
                never get found. There are rumours of whole communities that do 
                that. They just hide under the very noses of royalty in the depths 
                of their estates. And the luxuries of private cinemas, enormous 
                swimming pools, monstrous cars, private armies, private helicopters 
                and yachts. It's too much!&quot;<p>
                Tracey might have been poor at sums at school, but she had a vague 
                idea what the value of money was. &quot;Where'd they get their 
                fucking wealth from? I mean, this is a poor country!&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yeah!&quot; agreed Sharon. &quot;In comparison to most people 
                we've seen here we're like fucking millionaires. I mean this country's 
                got nothing. It doesn't make cars. It doesn't sell much food. 
                I've never seen anything back home with 'Made In Buggery' written 
                on it.&quot;<p>
                Buttercup smiled at the idea of something being labelled 'Made 
                In Buggery'. &quot;Buggery makes its money from sex,&quot; she 
                answered.<p>
                &quot;Sex?&quot; wondered Tracey, frowning quizzically.<p>
                &quot;Yes,&quot; agreed Buttercup. &quot;I've only heard about 
                this. But what I've heard is, that Sex Tourism is really big business. 
                That's why there's so much of it in a country where most of it 
                is out of bounds to foreigners and where everything behind the 
                wall is out of bounds to even people from Buggery. Of my friends 
                at school, a lot ended up in Sex Tourism. I don't know what they're 
                doing now, of course. And there are even schools and colleges 
                which specialise in teaching it. The art of sex tourism, I'm told, 
                is to exercise no discretion at all in what sexual relations you 
                have.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Like prostitution?&quot; suggested Sharon, who'd once seriously 
                considered this as a career option. After all she was always just 
                giving it away. Why not get a bit back from it?<p>
                &quot;What's 'prostitution'?&quot; wondered Buttercup. &quot;I 
                don't think I've ever heard that word before.&quot; <p>
                &quot;Is it just sex tourism that makes money?&quot; wondered 
                Tracey, who decided to rescue her friend from having to provide 
                a complex explanation.<p>
                &quot;No,&quot; said Buttercup pushing a strand of golden hair 
                out of her face and directing her sparkling eyes at Tracey in 
                a direct way that still unsettled her, even after their last couple 
                of hours of walking together. &quot;It's substantial but not crucial. 
                Buggery is the leading supplier of pornography and sex related 
                entertainment in the world. Apparently (and Buggery is proud of 
                this) it is the premier supplier in terms of quality and explicitness 
                as well as quantity. I don't know the exact statistics, but over 
                95% of all the world's snuff movies come from Buggery. The film 
                industry produces some 40% of the world's sex films, and some 
                of the biggest porn stars are from Buggery. The country also supplies 
                a substantial proportion of hard core pornographic books and magazines, 
                and so much pornographic television that the country's national 
                television station is just a pornographic propaganda machine.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Is sex really enough for these people to get so rich?&quot;<p>
                &quot;I'm sure there's reinvestment as well. But it's not just 
                the royalty that has to be financed, there's also the war with 
                Gomorrah. It's an expensive war. And it's only sustainable because 
                Buggery tolerates a very high death rate.&quot;<p>
                &quot;A high death rate?&quot; asked Tracey. <p>
                &quot;I don't know more than that,&quot; Buttercup admitted. &quot;But 
                behind the wall, it's the main reason why there aren't too many 
                men there. They just go to the front to fight against Gomorrah 
                and never return. Mind you! They're maybe the lucky ones. The 
                ones that got out. At least they're no longer going to be mutilated 
                by the nobility just for their perverted pleasure.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Like your friends you were telling us about?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Yes, that's right,&quot; sighed Buttercup. &quot;I was soon 
                the only one left in that room, although other girls joined me 
                later. The girl who'd had her hand cut off had one more session 
                with the baron, who apparently likes amputated stumps stuck up 
                his anus and other places. She didn't survive. The girl with the 
                broken nose was reclassified as an Epsilon, and either left for 
                the sex industry or the war. She would never have appeared on 
                national television with a broken nose. That sort of thing's never 
                allowed, but she might've appeared in a violent sex movie perhaps, 
                where apparently there's a preference for beautiful girls with 
                small defects.<p>
                &quot;And I was a survivor. And that's what I've been ever since. 
                I've avoided having sex with the baron, which probably explains 
                some of it. I've been fucked by the baroness a few times and one 
                of their children took a fancy to me when he was just eleven. 
                On the whole, though, I've just been one of many on the Baron's 
                estate who're supposed to have regular sex with each other. It's 
                an ambience he apparently enjoys. <p>
                &quot;My instructress explained my duties to me. I wasn't just 
                to stay there in luxury, I was told. Besides unquestioning sex 
                with whoever would so chose, which was fairly frequent, (but I'd 
                been trained for that) I was to work in the garden. My school 
                results showed that I had an inclination towards biology and horticulture. 
                This was true, but I'd never had the ambition of tending flowers 
                and grass all day and every day. But at least I was out in the 
                open air, and in a position much less exposed to the attention 
                of nobility or whoever. I was never to wear clothes. Only certain 
                privileged people like the instructresses and nobility and police 
                have that privilege. I was to remove all bodily hair, and, as 
                a gardener, to look as natural as possible. Not all girls have 
                such favourable conditions. Some had to shave their heads. Some 
                had extensive body piercing. Some had very peculiar things done 
                to their body. All according to their r&ocirc;les in the Baron's 
                estate. <p>
                &quot;My instructress had a very limited part in my life from 
                then on. Her task was to prepare new girls for the Baron's pleasures 
                and then tell them what to do next. I was just a gardener who 
                worked with other girls and one or two men and a couple of eunuchs.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Eunuchs?&quot; wondered Sharon, thinking about what a waste 
                of cock this would be.<p>
                &quot;Yes,&quot; sighed Buttercup. &quot;This was another taste 
                of the Baron's. In fact, he liked to conduct the actual castration. 
                Apparently that was a sport he particularly enjoyed.&quot; Buttercup 
                glanced towards a patch of wall which could be seen in the distance, 
                and then said with a touch of bitterness: &quot;In comparison 
                to most people, I've spent most of the last two years in relative 
                comfort in amongst the Baron's herbaceous borders.&quot;<p>
                VIII
              <p>Buttercup's skills extended far beyond the sensual as Sharon 
                and Tracey became increasingly aware as they continued their tramp 
                through the woods. It was she who told them how to orientate their 
                progress on the map by reference to the position of the Sun and 
                its height in the sky. This meant that they were able to get further 
                away from the wall, which, as Buttercup reminded them, was probably 
                not very safe when there was almost certainly a hunt being organises 
                for her. &quot;They wouldn't like to encourage others to escape, 
                if they knew they could get away with it,&quot; she commented. 
                Despite their desperation, Buttercup's presence somehow lifted 
                both the girls' spirits, although it was clear that she responded 
                positively to Tracey's more unambiguous attraction to her. She 
                took Tracey's hand in hers (something no man or woman had ever 
                done in her all her years of love-making) and squeezed it occasionally 
                in a reassuring way as they walked under the overhanging branches 
                and avoided nettles and bracken. Sharon accepted this reluctantly, 
                but as she reminded herself as she watched her best friend and 
                her new lover gaily swinging their arms from clasped hands, it 
                was cock not cunt she relished. Even when she responded with a 
                faint tingle when Buttercup occasionally touched her arm or kissed 
                her encouragingly on the cheek.<p>
                The trek through the woods seemed to go on longer than either 
                Sharon or Tracey had anticipated, but then neither of them had 
                had much experience of, or previous inclination towards, either 
                map-reading or walking. In fact, it was clear that they were actually 
                making faster progress with Buttercup than they were before. They 
                were having fewer rests and they seemed to have gained new energy 
                to stride forward faster and further than previously. As the night 
                drew in, they actually found a deserted cottage which seemed suitable 
                for them to rest the night. This would be luxury compared to where 
                they'd been sleeping the last few nights, even though it was in 
                a very dilapidated state. Half the cottage was totally collapsed 
                and less than half of its roof was in any sense intact. However, 
                it kept the night chill away from the girls' bare flesh: especially 
                Buttercup who didn't even have as much as a blouse to keep her 
                warm. They made space for themselves in the weeds and rubble of 
                what were once rooms and watched the shadows lengthen as day came 
                rather abruptly to a close.<p>
                It was now that Buttercup's skills as a gardener came to the fore 
                as she somehow managed to locate some potatoes, carrots, turnips 
                and other vegetables that were still growing in the abandoned 
                ruins of what had once been a vegetable garden. Many of these 
                were vegetables neither Sharon nor Tracey would ever have considered 
                eating before. They looked so bland and not usually found on pizzas 
                or inside burgers, but now they seemed like the most perfect food 
                in the world. Soon all three girls were resting together in the 
                shadows of the trees cast by the half moon, sitting down in front 
                of a fire of twigs and small branches started by Tracey's cigarette 
                lighter in which roasted the vegetables that Buttercup had tugged 
                out of the ground and had prepared with some sharp stones. Sharon 
                sat slightly to one side enjoying the warmth given off by the 
                flames, while Tracey and Buttercup lay together. <p>
                When the food was ready, it tasted better to the girls than the 
                most delicious fried chicken or doner kebab had ever done before. 
                Better even than a chicken chow mein with sweet and sour sauce, 
                or a chicken vindaloo. It was also probably the plainest food 
                they'd ever eaten. No ketchup, vinegar, mayonnaise or even salt. 
                But after such a poor diet to which they'd become accustomed, 
                Sharon and Tracey felt somehow invigorated and energised. And 
                it was clear from the bright sparkle in Tracey's eyes that this 
                new vigour and energy was to be directed towards one particular 
                object.<p>
                Buttercup, as always, needed no prompting. After allowing sufficient 
                time for the food to sink into their system, she crawled on her 
                hands and knees towards Tracey, who was grinning in a curiously 
                stupid fashion, and gently pinched the folds of her vagina with 
                the forefingers of her right hand. Tracey moaned in a strangely 
                full-throated way, and gracefully parted her legs so that Buttercup 
                could swivel round and engage more fingers and her tongue on the 
                scarred and embattled terrain of her cunt. She sank back onto 
                her elbows, her head back, staring up at the half moon through 
                the tangled shadows of the overhanging trees, while Buttercup 
                expertly massaged, licked and caressed her sensitive and, oh so 
                tender!, erogenous zones towards further gasps of unrestrainable 
                pleasure and near ecstasy.<p>
                Sharon sat cross-legged watching her best friend make love to 
                someone else. Not for the first time, of course, but usually it 
                had been some hairy-arsed, winnets-blessed man, with saliva dripping 
                from his lower lip and a prick that usually either came to soon 
                or never got really stiff enough. Sharon was aware that she was 
                beginning to get jealous of the growing friendship between her 
                closest friend and this beautiful naked girl, but there was no 
                denying that Buttercup's presence was undoubtedly a good thing. 
                She was helping the two friends navigate through the woods, keeping 
                up their otherwise dejected spirits and was decidedly more practical-minded 
                than either of them were. <p>
                Sharon watched as Tracey responded to Buttercup's advances and 
                returned them by crawling underneath her body and taking the lips 
                of Buttercup's vagina in her teeth. Tracey had never experimented 
                with this sexual position of mutual oral sex before. Blow jobs 
                usually just led to fucking. No blokes, until she'd come to Buggery, 
                had ever shown any interest in putting their tongues to her cunt. 
                Perhaps it was the smell of fish and piss that put them off, she 
                wondered. But now this wonderful woman with a supermodel body 
                was tonguing her liked she'd never been tongued before, and as 
                she climaxed urgently, passionately, and loudly, she knew that 
                her own reciprocation had really been clumsy and awkward. She 
                definitely needed more practise. She collapsed in exhaustion. 
                All the passion had exhausted her small reservoir of energy, and 
                she huddled in Buttercup's comforting sun-tanned arms.<p>
                Sharon smiled at the two of them, too tired and disorientated 
                to resent Tracey's sexual selfishness. And anyway Tracey had been 
                gagging for it all day. Sharon was still a little uneasy about 
                making love to a woman. Where was the cock in that? Buttercup 
                smiled back at Sharon and ran her tongue over her lips, clearly 
                advertising her continued availability. Sharon was just not interested, 
                which was unusual for her. <p>
                Somehow or other, conversation began about Tracey and Sharon's 
                life before they'd come to Buggery. Buttercup listened to their 
                account of life back home, and seemed to find it tremendously 
                exotic and even bizarre. The very concept of night-clubs and pubs 
                took some explaining. The girls' accounts of their sexual exploits 
                didn't impress her at all, however. Buttercup didn't find anything 
                very adventurous or exciting in their tales about making love 
                to several men at the same time, having both anal and vaginal 
                intercourse simultaneously, losing your knickers on the train 
                or being found by your parents with a boy's prick in your mouth.<p>
                Indeed, some of her comments rather shocked the girls, like: &quot;Didn't 
                you ask your parents to join in?&quot; or &quot;Why didn't you 
                make love with girls more often?&quot; or &quot;Is it true that 
                you're not supposed to show your vagina in public?&quot;<p>
                &quot;Don't you ever get to find out about anything in the world 
                outside of Buggery?&quot; wondered Sharon getting a little exasperated 
                by Buttercup's show of ignorance.<p>
                &quot;You've seen our television stations, haven't you?&quot; 
                Buttercup responded sweetly. &quot;When I was at school I genuinely 
                believed that the real world was like that.&quot;<p>
                &quot;But since then&#133; When you were behind the wall... Didn't 
                you find out more?&quot;<p>
                &quot;A little more. But not much. They've got another television 
                station which is relayed by cable behind the wall, which is a 
                bit different to what you can see at the tourist resorts. But 
                it's no better for finding out what's beyond Buggery's borders.&quot;<p>
                &quot;What's that station like?&quot; wondered Sharon. &quot;Does 
                it have sex in it? Or is it a normal television station?&quot;<p>
                &quot;It's more normal than what you've seen, in that people wear 
                clothes (or some clothes) on it. But it's no better for information. 
                And it's horribly cruel and violent. And that's because it suits 
                the depraved tastes of the Buggery aristocracy.&quot;<p>
                &quot;What could be more depraved than what we've already seen!&quot; 
                snorted Sharon. &quot;This whole country is just one bunch of 
                pervie bastards. There's nothing sane or normal here!&quot;<p>
                &quot;Well! There's a lot of violence. And a lot of sex. There's 
                a lot of sports and game shows: and they're not the nice sports 
                like you told me you see on tourist television. There are a lot 
                of gladiatorial sports. There's one sport which is basically where 
                two men armed with knives have to fight to castrate the other. 
                The winner is the one who (by whatever means) manages to slice 
                off his opponent's testicles and to hold them aloft. That's pretty 
                disgusting. And often, of course, one or both of them die. There 
                are others which are just fights to the death, where the loser 
                survives at least long enough to see that he or she has lost. 
                And when it involves disembowelling and live organ removal, just 
                how they lost in gruesome detail.<p>
                &quot;There is wrestling: but the only kind of wrestling you see 
                is where the aim of the exercise is to anally fuck the opponent. 
                It looks really odd as two men who have to keep their penises 
                as erect as they can (so they're always masturbating themselves 
                as they fight) have to try and get their opponent into a position 
                that they can force their prick into the other's arsehole. There 
                are team sports too: but many of those also involve death, castration 
                and sodomy.<p>
                &quot;Another game is where a person has to run away from others, 
                including dogs, whose task is to rape him or her. This might take 
                place in a maze, where the victim has no idea who or what might 
                be around the next bend or corner. In this case the victim has 
                to be able to both run quite fast and to be able to fight off 
                the attackers. The victim is considered to have won when he or 
                she has reached wherever the end point is and to have escaped 
                anal intercourse. And, for a woman, vaginal intercourse as well. 
                It's quite possible for a victim to win because she's only been 
                fucked but not been buggered.&quot;<p>
                &quot;It can't all be sport on television?&quot; wondered Tracey 
                who'd never really followed sport much at home, although she liked 
                watching wrestling for the pleasure of watching the men's bodies.<p>
                &quot;There are films as well. These must be made for export in 
                most cases and some are very well-made. But they're very violent 
                too. And I'm sure the violence is real. When characters are slowly 
                mutilated to death, or repeatedly beaten, or have parts of their 
                body removed then you can be sure it's the real thing. And there's 
                usually some rape involved in it. It seems that it's impossible 
                to kill or harm someone without having sex with them. Often the 
                victims are restrained by ropes or manacles. Sometimes they are 
                just beaten into compliance.&quot;<p>
                &quot;The actors can't have a long career can they?&quot; wondered 
                Tracey. <p>
                &quot;Not if they are deemed to be villains or if they are one 
                of those to be attacked early in the films. But even those who 
                are considered the heroes or heroines are not that nice. They 
                seem not to care if they gouge out the eyes of their victims, 
                or castrate them, or slice off their limbs, or disembowel them. 
                Even if they are supposed to be acting on behalf of goodness and 
                decency. And they are just as likely to rape their victims. The 
                main difference is that the good characters will always survive. 
                However, there was one character whose descent towards her final 
                death started off with her being considered a heroine. But in 
                the process of that film she had both of her arms severed just 
                below the shoulders. Her suffering was grotesque and genuine, 
                as near the start of the film her arms were cut off with a knife 
                while being raped. She spent the rest of the film having to adapt 
                to her new physical deficiency. Something which was treated relatively 
                sympathetically. She was a very beautiful girl. Somehow or other 
                she managed with the assistance of others in bringing her attackers 
                to their own gross and disturbing deaths, inevitably including 
                their own mutilation. Then I saw her in another film where this 
                time she had her legs cut off with an axe just below the hips 
                and spent the rest of the film hobbling about as just a torso. 
                Not surprising the last film I saw her in she was repeatedly gang-raped 
                and then tortured until her death. This film had very little pretence 
                of a plot. And I can't imagine she could have enjoyed even the 
                smallest part of it.&quot;<p>
                Sharon didn't enjoy the idea of Buggery television very much. 
                &quot;Can't we change the subject,&quot; she suggested. &quot;Look 
                at the sky!&quot;<p>
                She pointed up at the half moon through the lattice of branches 
                in the wood. Overhead there was a faint roar of an aeroplane going 
                by. The two friends watched the aeroplane's tail lights sadly.<p>
                &quot;That's where we ought to be!&quot; Tracey said. <p>
                &quot;I'd do anything to be watching a normal game show on television,&quot; 
                Sharon mused. &quot;To go in a pub and get a pint of lager. Get 
                really pissed, and get fucked by some fat greasy slob with spew 
                down his tee-shirt.&quot;<p>
                Buttercup sighed. &quot;I'm sure we'll get there. I see on your 
                map that we can't be too far from the front with Buggery.&quot; 
                <p>
                &quot;It's still fucking thirty miles. And it's not all fucking 
                woods,&quot; Sharon elaborated. <p>
                &quot;Two days!&quot; mused Tracey leaning her head wearily on 
                Buttercup's shoulder, long hair brushing against her face. &quot;At 
                fifteen miles a day, we'll do it in two days!&quot; <p>
                IX</p>
              <p>The girls had been in woods for many days now and had become 
                rather accustomed to their remoteness from the civilised world. 
                Sharon commented that at home they'd have been bound to meet someone 
                walking in the woods, but as Buttercup pointed out from the map 
                there were just no places near them where people would be likely 
                to be coming from. As she elaborated, people in Buggery didn't 
                have the leisure time to be walking in the woods for no purpose.<p>
                However, they did at last come across someone else, as they emerged 
                out of thick wood into a clearing. It was a woman gathering dried 
                wood. Typically for this country, she was naked with a shaved 
                head. As they had seen no one for so many days, it seemed sensible 
                just to girls stay quiet and still in the hope that they wouldn't 
                be noticed while she was working. <p>
                &quot;You don't have to hide you know,&quot; the woman called 
                out to them. &quot;I know you're there.&quot; She picked up her 
                bundle of twigs and branches and walked towards where they were.<p>
                Sharon, Tracey and Buttercup emerged nervously from the shadows 
                and stood in the speckled sunlight. The woman stared at them with 
                a quizzical expression, passing her eyes from one girl to another 
                and back again. She had probably been very attractive once, and 
                she was probably not much older than thirty. Most of her teeth 
                were missing. Her nose was broken and slightly twisted. A jagged 
                scar disfigured one of her breasts. &quot;My! You're a funny crowd! 
                Are you on the run?&quot;<p>
                Tracey nodded her head. &quot;We're on our way to Gomorrah.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Gomorrah!&quot; exclaimed the woman with an amused smile. 
                &quot;Well, you've got to have somewhere to run to if you're running 
                away I suppose.&quot; She dropped her bundle to her feet and hobbled 
                towards them with the faltering step of a much older person. &quot;You'll 
                be pleased to know that it's not far to go now. The war zone's 
                really close to here. It used to be a lot further away. Many kilometres 
                away. But it's been getting steadily closer as the war's gone 
                on. Bit like the tide coming in, I guess.&quot;<p>
                The girls felt strangely awe-struck by the disfigured woman. She 
                was so skinny, with the outline of her ribs and hips showing clearly 
                through her tanned bare skin. Her feet were flattened and rough. 
                Her toe- and finger-nails were crooked and broken. Many of her 
                teeth were missing, particularly at the front. Back home, Sharon 
                and Tracey had never seen anyone in such a bad way, except after 
                a good scrap in the pub car park. And then it'd be mostly patched 
                up when the hospital had got them to them.<p>
                &quot;You're a strange lot. I've never seen anyone like you before. 
                We get a lot of runaways round here. Mostly to seek a better life 
                in Gomorrah. Or anywhere really. But you're the strangest yet. 
                I suppose you're worried about being caught and sent back. And 
                that's why you're wandering in the woods.&quot;<p>
                &quot;There's a lot of police about!&quot; Sharon said.<p>
                &quot;Well, that may be so. But there's no reason here why they'd 
                be bothered about you lot in particular. Law and order sort of 
                starts to disintegrate round here. No one can be bothered to enforce 
                His Majesty's Justice when you spend all your time dodging bullets 
                and things. And that's why I live here.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Why? Because there's no law and order?&quot; wondered Buttercup.<p>
                The woman didn't really answer. She looked at Buttercup's beautiful 
                naked figure with a horrible lascivious leer. &quot;My! You're 
                a pretty one!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;You're the prettiest 
                one I've ever seen! I'd love to have you suck my cunt!&quot; The 
                woman scratched her chin contemplatively with a hand from which 
                two fingers were missing. <p>
                The woman walked right up to Buttercup and stood right in front 
                of her. Tracey had become sufficiently sensitive to her new lover 
                to notice her flinch ever so slightly as the woman approached. 
                She answered Buttercup's question. &quot;No, sweetheart. Where 
                there's no law and order, then you can survive. It's the law which 
                kills people. In most of Buggery you can't live at all when you 
                lose your looks. Or like me get brutally and violently raped by 
                the police. You don't stand a chance in most of Buggery. You last 
                as long as you can, and that's only so long as the police don't 
                take an interest in you for one reason or another. Or you don't 
                get called up for fighting against the Gomorrans. Round here no 
                one gives a fuck. There's no eugenic policy - official or otherwise.&quot; 
                <p>
                The woman raised her other hand, which still had a full set of 
                fingers, and without ceremony or introduction stroked Buttercup's 
                breasts. &quot;You'll want some food, won't you? Something to 
                eat. You can't buy it round here. You can only grow it, steal 
                it or sell your body for it.&quot;<p>
                &quot;Can't you buy anything at the villages?&quot; wondered Tracey. 
                <p>
                &quot;Villages!&quot; sniffed the woman. &quot;You're only five 
                kilometres from the front. Villages can't survive here. They get 
                bombed to pieces. You have to live in a bunker to survive round 
                here. There are no villages anywhere around her! The nearest you 
                have to a village must be Tranquillity. That's a real hovel which 
                supplies sex to the soldiers before they head off to fight in 
                the war. And probably die. You could buy sex there, but not any 
                food. You can buy sex here if you want. And you can sell it too. 
                It's a lot less precious than food, I can tell you! If you want 
                food you're going to have to follow me. And you're going to have 
                to pay for it! But not with money! What could I do with money 
                round here?&quot;<p>
                The woman looked at the girls. &quot;Well! Are you coming with 
                me or you going to stay in the fucking woods forever? And is any 
                one of you going to help me carry these fucking twigs?&quot; <p>
                Sharon nodded and reluctantly stepped forward. &quot;Yeah! We'll 
                come. At least you're not police!&quot;<p>
                The woman smiled grimly. &quot;And you can call me Joy by the 
                way. That's what I'm called, but that doesn't necessarily describe 
                me.&quot;<p>
                She picked up the bundle that lay on the ground, which was tied 
                together by more flexible branches, and lunged it over to Sharon. 
                She gasped as she took the weight off Joy. Fuck! They were heavy! 
                She swang them over her shoulder, feeling the rough branches against 
                her skin through the blouse, and followed Joy as she hobbled ahead 
                of them through the woods. Fortunately, Tracey and Buttercup took 
                turns in helping her carry the bundle, so it wasn't so bad. But 
                even five minutes at a time was more weight than she'd ever carried 
                before. They walked in single line through a tortuous route that 
                seemed to follow no obvious paths, stepping over fallen logs and 
                ducking under tangled bracken. Now that Tracey was carrying the 
                bundle and cursing every fucking twig while she did so, Sharon 
                now noticed for the first time that Joy had a bit of a limp, and 
                that half of one of her buttocks was missing. <p>
                Also for the first time, as they stumbled along, the girls began 
                to appreciate just how close they must be to the war zone. They 
                passed the rotting hull of a crashed aeroplane, parts of which 
                were still hanging from the branches of the trees. And they passed 
                a few holes that Tracey at first thought had been dug, but which 
                Buttercup pointed out were more likely to be craters caused by 
                falling bombs. <p>
                And then, for the first time in days, they were out of the woods 
                and found themselves on a road which stretched away from the wood 
                across open fields into the distance. The three girls paused in 
                the unfamiliar, open space. They could see more than several yards 
                ahead. And the bright rays of the sun in the open air was overwhelming 
                after the speckled light and dark shadows they'd become accustomed 
                to. <p>
                Joy did not appreciate their pause. &quot;Fuck's sake!&quot; She 
                yelled. &quot;It's fucking dangerous here. You don't want to get 
                shot, do you? And don't wander around randomly. There are mines, 
                unexploded bombs and all things round here. So just follow where 
                I go and don't even think of making a fucking detour.&quot; She 
                turned round with a grimace, and hobbled on as the unforgiving 
                sun beat down on her and on the girls. Sharon's skin burnt in 
                the bright light and the sharp pain of the heat became indistinguishable 
                form the sharp pain of the branches she was carrying. But, from 
                the advice she had been given, she was able to see the landscape 
                in a new light. The many holes which dotted the uncultivated fields 
                had definitely not been dug. They were too shallow and too strangely 
                smooth. And the rusted hulks she could see in the distance were 
                almost certainly not the tractors and cars like you'd expect to 
                see in the country back home. They almost certainly served some 
                military purpose.<p>
                After a mile or so of trudging through the desolate fields, Joy 
                led them to what looked like some kind of a settlement. It was 
                in fact the bombed remains of a tinned fruit factory, with a large 
                commercial sign pointing to the foreman's office and industrial 
                machinery scattered about. <p>
