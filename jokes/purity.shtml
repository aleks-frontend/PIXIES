                Disclaimer:<br>
                The user of this test acknowledges that sex is a hazardous sport; 
                that a person must copulate in control, and use good judgement 
                at all times; that partners' conditions vary constantly and are 
                greatly affected by weather changes and previous use; and that 
                dirty sheets, variations in terrain and bed surfaces, /pimps/managers, 
                forest growth, rocks and debris, clothed obstacles, and many other 
                natural and man-made obstacles and hazards, including other users 
                and customers, exist throughout the bedroom area. Personal managers 
                (pimps/spouses) and sado-masochistic operations and equipment 
                are constantly in use and may be hazardous to those not copulating 
                in control. Impotence, collisions, and social diseases resulting 
                in injury can happen at any time, even to those copulating in 
                control with proper sexual equipment. Inherent risks are part 
                of the sport and may exist within your partner. As a condition 
                of being permitted to use the facilities of your partner, the 
                user of this test agrees to copulate in control and within the 
                limits of his/her ability, and further acknowledges and accepts 
                these hazards, dangers, and risks and assumes the risk of injury 
                or loss to person or damage to property which might result from 
                use of the partner's facilities.<br>
                As a further condition of being permitted to use the facilities 
                of your partner, the customer understands and agrees that: (1) 
                in the event of a transfer of use by another or anything else 
                in the management's opinion is misconduct, misuse, kinky, impotence, 
                or nuisance, this service may be revoked without refund; (2) the 
                partner is the property of the harem and, upon request, s/he must 
                be presented to any authorized representative of the pimp/spouse; 
                (3) sexual equipment must be visibly displayed at all times when 
                you are in any bedroom and when approaching the bed to copulate. 
                Your sexual partner is not transferable; see Theft of Services, 
                V.S.A., Sections 2581and 2582.<br>
