                    <p>I told my blonde girlfriend that I was going skeet shooting.</p>
                    <p>She told me she didn't know how to cook them.</p>
                    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Two blondes are in a dark theatre:</p>
                    <p>BLONDE #1: &quot;Hey, the guy next to me is jerking off!&quot;</p>
                    <p>BLONDE #2: &quot;Just ignore him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>BLONDE #1: &quot;I can't. He's using my hand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>This blonde and her boyfriend were sitting in a hot tub 
                      when the blonde said to her boyfriend, &quot;Is it true 
                      that if you pull your finger out, I'll sink?&quot;</p>
                    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>A dumb Blonde died and went to Heaven. When she got to 
                      the Pearly Gates, she met Saint Peter who said, &quot;Before 
                      you get to come into Heaven, you have to pass a test.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, No!&quot; she said but Saint Peter said not to 
                      worry he'd make it easy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who was God's son?&quot; said Saint Peter.</p>
                    <p>The dumb Blonde thought for a few minutes and said &quot;Andy!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That's interesting... What made you say that?&quot; 
                      said Saint Peter</p>
                    <p>Then She started to sing &quot;Andy walks with me! Andy 
                      talks with me! Andy tells me...&quot;</p>
                    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Did you hear about the blonde that went to library and 
                      checked out a book called &quot;How to Hug&quot;? Got back 
                      to the dorm and found out it was volume seven of the encyclopaedia...</p>
                    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>A blonde's response to the comment, &quot;THINK about it!&quot;:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don't have to think -- I'm blonde!&quot;</p>
                    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>A blonde walked into a hardware store, picked up the hinges 
                      she was looking for, and went to go pay for them. The clerk 
                      asked her,</p>
                    <p>&quot;Need a screw for those hinges?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, but how about a blow job for the shovel in the 
                      back?&quot;</p>
                    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>BLONDE #1: &quot;Have you ever read Shakespeare?&quot;</p>
                    <p>BLONDE #2: &quot;No, who wrote it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Did you hear about the blonde mom who kept an icepack on 
                      her chest to keep the milk fresh?</p>
                    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>A government study has shown that blondes do have more 
                      fun - they just don't remember who with.</p>
                    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>... then there was the blonde who started the restaurant 
                      with the slogan &quot;Billions Served - just today&quot;</p>
                    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Did you hear about the blonde bride that was so horny she 
                      carried a bouquet of batteries?</p>
                    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>What about the blonde who gave birth to twins?</p>
                    <p>Her husband is out looking for the other man.</p>
                    <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>A painting contractor was speaking with a woman about her 
                      job. In the first room she said she would like a pale blue. 
                      The contractor wrote this down and went to the window, opened 
                      it, and yelled out &quot;GREEN SIDE UP!&quot; In the second 
                      room she told the painter she would like it painted in a 
                      soft yellow. He wrote this on his pad, walked to the window, 
                      opened it, and yelled &quot;GREEN SIDE UP!&quot; The lady 
                      was somewhat curious but she said nothing. In the third 
                      room she said she would like it painted a warm rose color. 
                      The painter wrote this down, walked to the window, opened 
                      it and yelled &quot;GREEN SIDE UP!&quot; The lady then asked 
                      him, &quot;Why do you keep yelling 'green side up'?&quot; 
                      &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; came the reply. &quot;But I have 
                      a crew of blondes laying sod across the street.</p>
                    <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Did you hear about the blonde who:</p>
                    <p>had more on her body than on her mind?</p>
                    <p>was called &quot;Sanka&quot; because she had no active 
                      ingredient in the bean?</p>
                    <p>took an hour to cook Minute Rice?</p>
                    <p>got into the taxi, and the driver kept the &quot;Vacant&quot; 
                      sign up?</p>
                    <p>was an M.D. - Mentally Deficient?</p>
                    <p>had a terrific stairway, but nothing upstairs?</p>
                    <p>thought nitrates were cheaper than day rates?</p>
                    <p>was told she was a silly puss, but insisted she didn't 
                      have a crazy cat?</p>
                    <p>after watching the ballerinas, wondered why they didn't 
                      get taller girls?</p>
                    <p>went to a nudist camp for a game of strip poker?</p>
                    <p>brought her cosmetics with her for a make-up exam?</p>
                    <p>thought Moby Dick was a venereal disease?</p>
                    <p>thought that a sanitary belt was a shot from a clean whiskey 
                      glass?</p>
                    <p>thought that intercourse was a state highway?</p>
                    <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>BLONDE #1: &quot;It's embarassing, but every time I sneeze, 
                      I have an orgasm.&quot;</p>
                    <p>BLONDE #2: &quot;Gee, what are you taking for it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>BLONDE #1: &quot;Snuff.&quot;</p>
                    <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>BLONDE: &quot;Excuse me sir, what time is it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>MAN: &quot;It's 3:15.&quot;</p>
                    <p>BLONDE: (puzzled look on her face) &quot;You know, it's 
                      the weirdest thing,</p>
                    <p>I have been asking that question all day, and each time 
                      I get</p>
                    <p>a different answer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>MALE SECRETARY: &quot;Feel free to use my dictaphone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>NEW BLONDE EMPLOYEE: &quot;No thanks, I'll just use my 
                      finger like</p>
                    <p>everyone else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Two blondes observed in a parking lot trying to unlock 
                      the door of their Mercedes with a coat hanger:</p>
                    <p>Blonde#1: I can't seem to get this door unlocked!</p>
                    <p>Blonde#2: Well, you'd better hurry up and try harder, its 
                      starting</p>
                    <p>to rain and the top is down!</p>
                    <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>A blonde, a brunette and a redhead went into a bar and 
                      asked the bartender:</p>
                    <p>Brunette: &quot;I'll have a B and C.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Bartender:&quot;What is a B and C?&quot;.</p>
                    <p>Brunette: &quot;Bourbon and Coke.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Redhead: &quot;And, I'll have a G and T.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Bartender: &quot;What's a G and T?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Redhead: &quot;Gin and tonic.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Blonde: &quot;I'll have a 15.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Bartender: &quot;What's a 15?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Blonde: &quot;7 and 7&quot;</p>
                    <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>There were three women who were at the gynecologist having 
                      pre-natal checkups. The doctor asked the first woman &quot;in 
                      what position was the baby conceived ?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He was on top &quot;, she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You will have a boy !&quot; the doctor exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>The second woman was asked the same question.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was on top &quot;, was the reply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;you will have a baby girl. &quot; said the doctor.</p>
                    <p>With this, the third women, a blond, burst into tears.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whats the matter ?&quot; asked the doc.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Am I going to have puppies ?&quot;.....</p>
                    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Blondes...</p>
                    <p>They take a lickin', and keep on...</p>
                    <p>Lickin!</p>
                    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Did you hear the one about the blonde who thought that 
                      &quot;love handles&quot; referred to her ears?</p>
                    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>A blonde goes into a bar. The bartender asks her what she 
                      would like, and she replies, &quot;Bring me a beer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The bartender then asks, &quot;Anheuser-Busch?&quot;</p>
                    <p>To which she replies, &quot;Fine thanks, and how's your 
                      cock?&quot;</p>
                    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Over the weekend I(can't remember name - on newsgrazer) 
                      heard a blonde telling this joke:</p>
                    <p>*</p>
                    <p>*Blonde Asks: What do you call a blonde in between two 
                      brunettes?</p>
                    <p>*Blonde Answers: An interprolater!</p>
                    <p>*</p>
                    <p>*We were laughing so hard we thought we were going to die. 
                      The funny</p>
                    <p>*part was that she thought we were laughing at her joke.</p>
                    <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Did you here about the blonde that stayed up all night 
                      to see where the sun went ? It finally dawned on here.</p>
                    <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>DOCTOR (Taking up his stethoscope): &quot;Big breaths.&quot;</p>
                    <p>ADOLESCENT BLONDE: &quot;Yeth, and I'm not even thixteen.&quot;</p>
                    <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>A blonde was driving down the highway to Disneyland when 
                      she saw a sign that said &quot;DISNEYLAND LEFT&quot;. After 
                      thinking for a minute, she said to herself &quot;oh well 
                      !&quot; and turned around an drove home. On her way home 
                      the same blonde drove past another sign that said</p>
                    <p> &quot;CLEAN RESTROOMS 8 MILES&quot;. By the time she drove 
                      eight miles, she had cleaned 43 restrooms.</p>
                    <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>How about the suicide blonde,</p>
                    <p>she dyed by her own hand.</p>
                    <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>A brunette and a blonde are walking along in a park. The 
                      brunette says suddenly, &quot;Awww, look at the dead birdie&quot;. 
                      The blonde stops, looks up, and says, &quot;Where?&quot;</p>
                    <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>A man comes home from work one night to catch his blonde 
                      girlfriend sliding down the banister, naked. He blurts out, 
                      &quot;What do you think you're doing!?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just heating up dinner,&quot; she replies.</p>
                    <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>A man and his blonde girlfriend were fooling around when 
                      the blonde asked, &quot;Would you mind taking off your ring? 
                      It's hurting me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ring, nothing.&quot; he quipped, &quot;That's my 
                      wristwatch.&quot;</p>
                    <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>A policeman pulled a blonde over after he/she'd been driving 
                      the wrong way on a one-way street.</p>
                    <p>Cop: Do you know where you were going?</p>
                    <p>Blonde: No, but wherever it is, it must be bad 'cause all 
                      the</p>
                    <p>people were leaving.</p>
                    <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>A cop stops a blonde woman who was driving down a motorway.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss, may I see your driver's licence please?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Driver's licence? What's that?...&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It's a little card with your picture on it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, duh! Here it is...&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;May I have your car insurance?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What's that?...&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It's a document that says you are allowed to drive 
                      the car.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh this? Duh! Here you go...&quot;</p>
                    <p>The cop then takes his dick out of his pants, while the 
                      blonde exclaims:&quot;Oh no, not another breathalyzer test!&quot;</p>
                    <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Hubby: As a start I think you should learn to &quot;iron&quot;, 
                      then we could do without the ironing lady.</p>
                    <p> Blonde Wife: Well, if you would learn to fuck me properly 
                      we could do without the gardener.</p>
                    <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>A blonde and a brunette were discussing their boyfriends:</p>
                    <p>Brunette: Last night I had *three* orgasms in a row!</p>
                    <p>Blonde: That's nothing; last night I had over a hundred.</p>
                    <p>Brunette: My god! I had no idea he was that good.</p>
                    <p>Blonde: ( looking shocked ) Oh, you mean with one guy.</p>
                    <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Three blondes are attempting to change a light bulb. One 
                      of them decides to call 911:</p>
                    <p>Blonde: We need help. We're three blondes changing</p>
                    <p>a light bulb.</p>
                    <p>Operator: Hmmmmm. You put in a fresh bulb?</p>
                    <p>Blonde: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Operator: The power in the house in on?</p>
                    <p>Blonde: Of course.</p>
                    <p>Operator: And the switch is on?</p>
                    <p>Blonde: Yes, yes.</p>
                    <p>Operator: And the bulb still won't light up?</p>
                    <p>Blonde: No, it's working fine.</p>
                    <p>Operator: Then what's the problem?</p>
                    <p>Blonde: We got dizzy spinning the ladder around and we 
                      all fell and hurt ourselves.</p>
                    <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>There were three people stranded on an island, a brunette, 
                      a redhead, and a blonde. The brunette looked over the water 
                      to the mainland and estimated about 20 miles to shore. So 
                      she announced, &quot;I'm going to try to swim to shore.&quot; 
                      So she swam out five miles, and got really tired. She swam 
                      out ten miles from the island, and she was too tired to 
                      go on, so she drowned. The second one, the redhead, said 
                      to herself, &quot;I wonder if she made it. I guess it's 
                      better to try to get to the mainland than stay here and 
                      starve.&quot; So she attempts to swim out. The redhead had 
                      a lot more endurance than the brunette, as she swam out 
                      10 miles before she even got tired. After 15 miles, she 
                      was too tired to go on, so she drowned.</p>
                    <p>So the blonde thought to herself, &quot;I wonder if they 
                      made it! I think I'd better try to make it, too.&quot; So 
                      she swam out 5 miles, ten miles, 15 miles, NINETEEN miles 
                      from the island. The shore</p>
                    <p>was just in sight, but she said, &quot;I'm too tired to 
                      go on!&quot; So she swam back.</p>
                    <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Teller: Why did the blonde move to L.A.?</p>
                    <p>Blonde: I don't know. Why?</p>
                    <p>Teller: It was easier to spell.</p>
                    <p>Blonde: Easier than what?</p>
                    <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Two blondes were walking through the woods when one looked 
                      down and said &quot;Oh, look at the deer tracks.&quot; The 
                      other blonde looks and says &quot;Those arn't deer tracks, 
                      those are wolf tracks.&quot; &quot;No. Those are deer tracks.&quot; 
                      They keep arguing, and arguing, and one half hour later 
                      they were both killed by a train.</p>
                    <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>The blonde came running downstairs, crying. Her mother 
                      asked what was wrong and the blonde said her boyfriend had 
                      just dropped her.Her mother (a blonde) nodded wisely and 
                      proceeded to tell her about the birds and the bees and the 
                      blonde said: &quot;No ma. I can</p>
                    <p>fuck and suck with the best of them. But he says I can't 
                      cook&quot;</p>
                    <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>A blonde was telling a priest a Pollock joke, when halfway 
                      through the priest interrupts her, &quot;Don't you know 
                      I'm Polish?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I'm sorry,&quot; the blonde apologizes, &quot;do 
                      you want me to start over</p>
                    <p>and talk slower?&quot;</p>
                    <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Three blondes were walking through the desert when found 
                      a magic genie's lamp</p>
                    <p> t he said, &quot;I will grant three wishes, one for each 
                      of you.&quot; The first said, &quot;I wish I were smarter&quot;. 
                      So she became a redhead. The second blonde said &quot;I 
                      wish I were smarter than her.&quot; She became a brunette. 
                      The third blond said &quot;I wish I were smarter than both 
                      of them.&quot; So she became a man.</p>
                    <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Confucious say: blonde who fly upside down have crack up.</p>
                    <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>At a carwash in Burbank, there were two identical Hondas 
                      coming out at the same time. A beautiful blond woman jumps 
                      into one and takes off, leaving its owner rather perplexed. 
                      About three minutes later, she reappears at the car wash 
                      yelling, &quot;who ripped off my car phone!&quot;</p>
                    <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Last night I went home to my blonde girlfriend, and told 
                      her I was going to screw her brains out. Then I realized 
                      I was too late.</p>
                    <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>A blonde is suffering froma sore throat so she goes to 
                      see the doctor. She explains the problem to the doctor who 
                      asks her to sit down. He gets out his torch and says &quot;Open 
                      wide&quot;. &quot;I can't,&quot; replies the blonde, &quot;the 
                      chair's fitted with arms.&quot;</p>
                    <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>A blonde friend of mine was looking for some transportation, 
                      so I bought her a Woody. I called her up later and asked 
                      how she like it. She told me it was OK, but that it didn't 
                      look so good once she had taken it out of the crate.</p>
                    <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>A blonde goes into the drug store to buy some rubbers (so 
                      she can practice safe sex). She walks up to the pharmicist 
                      and asks &quot;How much for a box of rubbers?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They're $1 for a box of 3,&quot; he replied, &quot;Plus 
                      6 cents for the tax.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said the blonde, &quot;I wondered how they 
                      kept them on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Another blonde, another store. She goes over to the deodorant 
                      display and tells the clerk &quot;I need to buy some deodorant 
                      for my husband.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Does he use the ball kind?&quot; enquired the clerk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; replied the blonde, &quot;The kind for 
                      under his arms.&quot;</p>
                    <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>This guy just started at his new job, working at a porno 
                      shop. His boss comes out and tells him that he has to leave 
                      for a while, and &quot;can you handle it? &quot;The new 
                      employee is somewhat reluctant, but with the boss's positive 
                      comments he finally agrees. So, the guy is there by himself 
                      for a little while and a white woman comes in. She asks, 
                      &quot;How much for the white dildo?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He answers, &quot;$35.&quot; She: &quot;How much for the 
                      black one?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He: &quot;$35 for the black one, $35 for the white one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She: &quot;I think I'll take the black one. I've never 
                      had a black one before.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She pays him, and off she goes.</p>
                    <p>A little bit later a black woman comes in and asks &quot;How 
                      much for the black dildo?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He: &quot;$35.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She: &quot;How much for the white one?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He: &quot;$35 for the white one, $35 for the black one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She: &quot;Hmmm...I think I'll take the white one. I've 
                      never had a white one before...&quot;</p>
                    <p>She pays him, and off she goes.</p>
                    <p>About an hour later a young blonde woman comes in and asks, 
                      &quot;How much are your dildos?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He: &quot;$35 for the white, $35 for the black.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She: &quot;Hmmmmm....how much is that plaid one on the 
                      shelf?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He: &quot;Well, that's a very special dildo...it'll cost 
                      you $165.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She thinks for a moment and answers, &quot;I'll take the 
                      plaid one, I've never had a plaid one before....&quot;</p>
                    <p>She pays him, and off she goes.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the guy's boss returns and asks, &quot;How did 
                      you do while I was gone?&quot;</p>
                    <p>To which the saleman responded, &quot;I did really good, 
                      I sold one white dildo, one black dildo, and I sold your 
                      thermos for $165!&quot;</p>
                    <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>A young blonde woman is asked out on a date and accepts. 
                      The boy picks her up and they go to a nearby carnival in 
                      town. They ride a few rides, play a few games, and seem 
                      to be generally hitting it off well. During a sort of romantic 
                      lull, however, the boy says, &quot;What do you want to do 
                      now?&quot; &quot;I want a weigh,&quot; she says. Well, OK, 
                      thinks the boy. They walk over to the fortune scales, and 
                      weigh her. They play a few more games and stop for foods.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you want to do now?&quot; asks the boy again. 
                      &quot;I want a weigh,&quot; she says.</p>
                    <p>Hmmm, a little odd but I'll put up with it, thinks the 
                      boy. Again they get her weight and fortune. After yet another 
                      few games and an exquisite fireworks show, the boy</p>
                    <p>repeats, &quot;What do you want to do now?&quot; &quot;I 
                      want a weigh,&quot; she says. Damn, thinks the boy, she's 
                      just too weird for me. They get her weight and fortune, 
                      and the boy drives her home.</p>
                    <p>As she walks into the house, her sister asks, &quot;How'd 
                      your date go?&quot;&quot;Wousy,&quot; says the girl.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Imitation of a blonde refuelling..</p>
                    <p>(Flap hand, blowing air into ears)</p>
                    <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Another blonde sent a post card home:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Having a wonderful time....Where am I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Did you hear about the blonde that was so stupid that she 
                      played third string at a car wash?</p>
                    <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>After many hours of extremely acrobatic and exhausting 
                      sex with a blonde he had just picked up, a man goes into 
                      the kitchen for some food to replenish his just-spent energy. 
                      He pours himself a glass of milk and right before drinking 
                      it, he realizes his manhood is still pretty hot, so he sticks 
                      it in the glass to cool it off. Just then the blonde walks 
                      in</p>
                    <p>and says, &quot;Oh, I always wondered how you refilled 
                      those.&quot;</p>
                    <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>A blonde and a brunette were talking one day. The brunette 
                      said that her boyfriend had a slight dandruff problem but 
                      she gave him &quot;Head and Shoulders&quot; and it cleared 
                      it up. The blonde asked inquisitively, &quot;How do you 
                      give shoulders?&quot;</p>
                    <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>How is a blonde like a.......</p>
                    <p>Hairdryer? Turn her on and she starts to blow.</p>
                    <p>Vaccum Cleaner? Turn her on and she starts to suck.</p>
                    <p>Light Switch? Even a six year old can turn her on.</p>
                    <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Person 1: What's the difference between a blonde and garbage?</p>
                    <p>Person 2: Garbage gets taken out at least once a week.</p>
                    <p>Person 1: Wrong. You tie the garbage up before you take 
                      it out.</p>
                    <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Did you hear what the blonde who was opening a new bar 
                      said when her lawyer explained to her that she needed a 
                      liquor license? &quot;Oh, it's not gonna be THAT kind of 
                      a bar. That's disgusting!&quot;</p>
                    <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>There was a blonde driving down the road listening to the 
                      radio. The announcer was telling blonde joke after blonde 
                      joke until the blonde was mad enough she turned her radio 
                      off. A mile down the road, she saw another blonde out in 
                      a corn field in a boat rowing. The blonde stopped her car 
                      jumped out and yelled, &quot;You bimbo, it's blondes like 
                      you that give us all a bad name. If I could swim I'd come 
                      out there and give you what's coming to you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>&quot;How come she got expelled from school?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She was caught cheating.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She was counting her breasts during a biology exam!&quot;</p>
                    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Maggie's first pregnancy had produced triplets. With considerable 
                      pride she was telling her blonde friend how this happened 
                      once in every 200,000 times. The blonde's eyes widened: 
                      &quot;Beats me how you ever found timeto do any housework!&quot;</p>
                    <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>A dumb blonde was bragging about her knowledge of the state 
                      capitals (or for Bill Clinton capitols). She proudly said,&quot; 
                      go ahead, ask me, I know all of them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A red head said, &quot;O.K., what's the capital of Wisconsin?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The blonde replied, &quot;Oh, that's easy, 'W'.&quot;</p>
                    <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>A blonde was walking along, when she looked up to observe 
                      a bird flying overhead. Suddenly, the bird drops a load 
                      when it was directly over her. The blonde says, &quot;Good 
                      thing I had my mouth open, or that would've hit me right 
                      in the face!!!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Or: &quot;Good thing that cows don't fly.</p>

                    <p>A man walks into a bar, with a huge alligator on a leash. 
                      He walks over to the bar, and orders a beer. The bartender 
                      says &quot;Sorry sir. You can't bring that alligator in 
                      here! It's a dangerous animal, and you're scaring all of 
                      the patrons! True enough, the man looked around, and noticed 
                      that everyone was standing on the tables, looking very nervous. 
                      &quot;But wait!&quot; he</p>
                    <p>cried, &quot;this alligator is tame! It wouldn't hurt anyone!&quot;. 
                      However, the bartender is adamant. &quot;If&quot;, the man 
                      continues, &quot;I can prove that this alligator is not 
                      vicious, can he stay?&quot;. &quot;Well, I guess so&quot;, 
                      says the bartender, &quot;however, you're going to have 
                      a devil of a time proving to</p>
                    <p>everyone in here that that alligator is tame!&quot; The 
                      man smiles, and leans over the alligator. &quot;Ralph!&quot;, 
                      he shouts, &quot;Sit up!&quot; With that, he beats the alligator 
                      on the head with his fist &quot;BANG BANG BANG&quot;. And 
                      the alligator rears up on its tail. &quot;Ralph, open your 
                      mouth! BANG BANG BANG&quot;. And the alligator opened it's 
                      huge mouth wide, revealing row upon row of</p>
                    <p>gleaming white teeth. The man pulls out his wang, and lays 
                      it in the alligators mouth, as the entire bar crowd gasps. 
                      &quot;Ralph! Close your mouth, but DON'T BITE! BANG BANG 
                      BANG&quot;. As the man pummels the alligator on the head, 
                      the giant mouth slowley closes, and stops juuuussttt short 
                      of biting the guys dick off. The crowd sighs, and the man 
                      says &quot;Ralph, open your</p>
                    <p>mouth! BANG BANG BANG!&quot; and the alligators mouth opens 
                      wide again. &quot;There,&quot; says the man to the crowd, 
                      &quot; now would anyone else like to try this?&quot; A blonde 
                      in the back says &quot;Yeah, I'll try, but only if your 
                      promise not to hit me on the head so hard&quot;.</p>
