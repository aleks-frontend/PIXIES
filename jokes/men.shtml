                    <p>1. Don't call. EVER.<br>
                      2. If you don't like a girl, don't tell her. It's more fun 
                      to let her figure it out by herself.<br>
                      3. Name your penis. Be sure it is something narcissistic 
                      and unoriginal, such as &quot;spike&quot;<br>
                      4. If you lose something that belongs to someone else, tell 
                      them you already gave it to them.<br>
                      5. Play with yourself as often as possible. Tell everyone 
                      about it.<br>
                      6. Be as ambiguous as possible. If you don't want to answer, 
                      a grunt will do.<br>
                      7. Always remember: You are a man. Therefore, no matter 
                      what, it isn't your fault.<br>
                      8. Girls find it attractive if a man has had more women 
                      than showers.<br>
                      9. Never ask for help. Even if you really, really need help 
                      --- don't ask. People will think you have no penis.<br>
                      10. Women like it when you ignore them. It arouses them.<br>
                      11. If, GOD FORBID, you have to talk to a girl on the phone, 
                      use only monosyllabic words and noises. Bodily noises are 
                      permissible.<br>
                      12. Everyone finds a man more attractive if he can write 
                      his name in urine.<br>
                      13. One sure way to make a girl like you is to go after 
                      her best friend. She will then see what she's missing and 
                      love you for not giving up on her.<br>
                      14 . Deny everthing. Everything.<br>
                      15. If you like a girl, tell all your female friends about 
                      her. Especially female friends you suspect may have a crush 
                      on you. (Probably all of them --- you're a man remember?) 
                      They really<br>
                      want to know.<br>
                      16. No means yes.<br>
                      17. Yes means no.<br>
                      18. If you don't get sex whenever you want, your balls will 
                      shrivel.<br>
                      19. You may get sick or even die. This is one of the most 
                      important rules.<br>
                      20. If anyone asks, you have had sex in all possible positions 
                      and locations.<br>
                      21. Much like an orgasm signifies the end of a sexual peak, 
                      sex often signifies the end of a relationship.<br>
                      22. Feelings? What feelings?<br>
                      23. Life is one big competition. If someone is better than 
                      you at something, either pretend it's not true or kick their 
                      ass.<br>
                      24. DO NOT make decisions about relationships. If you are 
                      backed into a corner and must make a decision, stall. If 
                      you still must come up with an answer, leave yourself a 
                      loophole for escape. Example:<br>
                      Question: &quot;Honey, will you take me out for a romantic 
                      dinner?&quot;<br>
                      Answer: &quot;Yes, if you can guess how many sperm I produce 
                      each day.&quot;<br>
                      25. Every sentence that anyone says can be twisted to have 
                      sexual meaning. Twist.<br>
                      26. At any given opportunity, point out how things look 
                      like various genitalia. (If, by chance, you have Play-Doh, 
                      make sure you make a replica of your penis. Exagerate the 
                      dimensions).<br>
                      27. &quot;Love&quot; is not in your vocabulary. don't even 
                      think about saying it.<br>
                      28. A general rule: If whatever you're doing does not satisfy 
                      you completely in 5 minutes, it's really not worth it.<br>
                      29. Diss your girlfirend. Beg and plead until you get her 
                      back. Diss her again..<br>
                      30. Apologize whenever it's expected. NEVER mean it.<br>
                      31. If you hurt someone, pretend you care. Don't.<br>
                      32. Try to have a good memory, but it's OK if you forget 
                      trivial things. You know, like your girlfriend's b-day and 
                      eye color.<br>
                      33. Ignorance solves problems. If you can't see them, they 
                      can't see you.<br>
                      34. Play with your food only if you are in a public place 
                      with people you don't know.<br>
                      35. Play with your penis only if you are in a public place 
                      with people you don't know.<br>
                      35. If people express extreme disgust at whatever you are 
                      doing, DON'T STOP! This is the desired reaction.<br>
                      36. You are NOT a virgin. Ever. Males are born experienced.<br>
                      37. You are male, therefore you are superior.<br>
                      38. Agenda for a typical evening: Get beer. Drink beer. 
                      Play with yourself. Have sex. Drink more beer. Pass out.<br>
                      39. Females do not care what you do to them as long as they 
                      get to please you.<br>
                      40. If you're going out with someone but you love someone 
                      else, don't say anything. Wait until the girl you are going 
                      out with falls in love with you, and THEN tell her.<br>
                      41. Basic fundamental rule of dating: Quantity, not quality.<br>
                      42. Basic fundamental rule of sex: Quantity IS quality.<br>
                      43. If you cheat on a girl, but no one finds out, then technicallyyou've 
                      done nothing wrong.<br>
                      44. Crying is not manly. Then again, if you are a man, what 
                      do you have to cry about, anyway?<br>
                      45. If the question begins with &quot;why,&quot; the answer 
                      is &quot;I don't know.&quot;<br>
                      46. Women are your napkins. Use them, and throw them away.<br>
                      47. Remember, Every virgin girl is saving herself for YOU.<br>
                      48. Other peoples' pain is strictly for your amusement. 
                      Laugh long, laugh loud, laugh heartily. <br>
                      49. If anyone asks you for a favor- a) make a big deal about 
                      how hard it is for you to do it, b) remind them of this 
                      huge favour you've done for them at least every 5 minutes 
                      for the rest of their life.<br>
                      50. If you do something really mean to a girl, and she doesn't 
                      want to talk to you, pretend nothing happened. If she still 
                      doesn't talk to you, casually ask, &quot;is something wrong?&quot;<br>
                      51. Three words: Let's be friends. Translation: I never 
                      want to speak to you again, but it's bad for my nice-guy 
                      image if you are mad at me, so I'll pretend I want to be 
                      your friend.<br>
                      52. If you're on a date, and there is a lull in the conversation, 
                      tell the girl how many different dorms you've been laid 
                      in. </p>
                    <p>53. Here's a good trick. Tell a girl that you're going 
                      to leave for a few minutes and when you come back, you want 
                      her naked, sprawled on the bed. Leave,and go into her dad's 
                      room and<br>
                      tell him he should go check on his daughter. Then drive 
                      like hell.<br>
                      54. If a girl breaks up with you because you're in love 
                      with someone else, she has no right to be upset. Because, 
                      you know, SHE's the one who wanted to end the relationship.<br>
                      55. The best sex position is you, lying face up... and twenty 
                      girls on top.<br>
                      56. Default facial expression: blank stare.<br>
                      57. Spend your spare time thinking of excuses and shove 
                      them up your butt. Then, whenever you need a good excuse, 
                      you can pull it out of your ass.<br>
                      58. Don't listen to &quot;pussy music&quot; like Erasure, 
                      Color Me Badd, or Oldies.<br>
                      59. Beer. Then more beer.<br>
                      60. One word: FOOTBALL!</p>
