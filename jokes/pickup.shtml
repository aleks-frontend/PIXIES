                    <p>1 &quot;I'm down here!&quot;</p>
                    <p>2 &quot;Just because I've got bells on my feet doesn't 
                      mean I'm a sissy!&quot;</p>
                    <p>3 &quot;I was a lawn ornament for Gary Sweet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>4 &quot;I can get you off the naughty list!&quot;</p>
                    <p>5 &quot;I have certain needs that can't be satisfied by 
                      working on toys.&quot;</p>
                    <p>6 &quot;I'm a magical being! Take off your bra!&quot;</p>
                    <p>7 &quot;It's not size that matters babe!&quot;</p>
                    <p>8 &quot;I get a thimbleful of tequila into me and I turn 
                      into a wild man!&quot;</p>
                    <p>9 &quot;You'd look hot in a Raggedy Ann wig!&quot;</p>
                    <p>10 &quot;I can eat my weight in cocktail frankfurts!&quot;</p>
                    <p>11 &quot;That dress would look great on the floor next 
                      to my bed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>12 &quot;Nice shoes. Wanna fuck?&quot;</p>
                    <p>13 &quot;You have some nice jewellery. It would look good 
                      on my nightstand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>14 &quot;Chicks dig me - I wear coloured underwear!&quot;</p>
                    <p>15 &quot;Look at the tag on her shirt and say &quot;I wanted 
                      to see if you were really made in heaven.&quot;</p>
                    <p>16 &quot;If I gave you neglige for my birthday, would there 
                      be anything in it for me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>17 &quot;That's a nice shirt - can I talk you out of it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>18 &quot;Did you clean your pants with Windex? I can practically 
                      see myself in them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>19 &quot;Do I know you from somewhere - or is it just that 
                      you have your clothes on?&quot;</p>
                    <p>20 &quot;Hi, I'm conducting a feel test of how many women 
                      have pierced nipples.&quot;</p>
                    <p>21 &quot;Do you like jewels? Well suck my cock it's a gem!&quot;</p>
                    <p>22 She: &quot;What do you think of this dress/top/skirt?&quot; 
                      He: &quot;I like nothing better!&quot;</p>
                    <p>23 &quot;What do like for breakfast?&quot;</p>
                    <p>24 &quot;Can I buy you a drink, or would you just like 
                      the money?&quot;</p>
                    <p>25 &quot;Would you like a gin &amp; platonic or do you 
                      prefer scotch &amp; sofa?&quot;</p>
                    <p>26 &quot;Hey, how about pizza &amp; a fuck?&quot; &quot;What, 
                      don't you like pizza?&quot;</p>
                    <p>27 &quot;Would you like to have morning coffee with me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>28 &quot;Lets do breakfast tomorrow. Should I call you 
                      or nudge you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>29 &quot;Excuse me, why is your drink glowing?&quot;</p>
                    <p>30 &quot;I don't look like much now, I'm drinking milk.&quot;</p>
                    <p>31 &quot;I've had quite a bit to drink tonight &amp; you're 
                      beginning to look pretty good!&quot;</p>
                    <p>32 &quot;I've got a thirst baby, and you smell like Gatorade!&quot;</p>
                    <p>33 &quot;Do you like chicken? Suck this, it's foul!&quot;</p>
                    <p>34 &quot;Do you know the difference between hamburgers 
                      and head jobs?&quot; &quot;No? Let's do lunch then!&quot;</p>
                    <p>35 &quot;Hand out cards saying: &quot;Smile if you want 
                      to sleep with me&quot; and watch them hold back their laughter.</p>
                    <p>36 At the photocopier: &quot;Reproducing hey? Can I help?&quot;</p>
                    <p>37 Motion with your finger for the girl to come over. When 
                      she does say &quot;I knew if I fingered you enough you'd 
                      come!&quot;</p>
                    <p>38 Woman: &quot;Excuse me, do you have the time?&quot; 
                      Man: &quot;Do you have the energy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>39 Woman: &quot;Excuse me, do you have the time?&quot; 
                      Man: &quot;Do you have the place in mind?&quot;</p>
                    <p>40 When she asks for a match: &quot;My penis, your vagina.&quot;</p>
                    <p>41 Walk over to a ladies table, take your dick out &amp; 
                      say &quot;Hey Charlie, anyone here you recognise?&quot;</p>
                    <p>42 &quot;Stand back, I'm a doctor! You get an ambulance, 
                      I'll loosen her clothes!&quot;</p>
                    <p>43 Holding out fingers: &quot;Why should women masturbate 
                      with these fingers?&quot; &quot;Because they're mine!&quot;</p>
                    <p>44 &quot;Hi, my name is {name}. How do you like me so far?&quot;</p>
                    <p>45 &quot;You look like a girl who has heard every single 
                      line in the book - so what's one more!&quot;</p>
                    <p>46 &quot;Bond. James Bond.&quot;</p>
                    <p>47 &quot;Excuse me, are you ready to go home yet?&quot;</p>
                    <p>48 &quot;Hi, I make more money than you can spend.&quot;</p>
                    <p>49 &quot;Hi, can I buy you a car?&quot;</p>
                    <p>50 &quot;I'm new in town, can you give me directions to 
                      your apartment?&quot;</p>
                    <p>51 &quot;Was your father a thief? Because someone stole 
                      the stars from the sky &amp; put them in your eyes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>52 &quot;Was you father an alien? Because there's nothing 
                      else like you on earth!&quot;</p>
                    <p>53 &quot;You know what I like about you?&quot; &quot;My 
                      arms.&quot;</p>
                    <p>54 &quot;If you were a tear in my eye, I would not cry 
                      for fear of losing you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>55 &quot;I know this is going to sound like a line, but 
                      did that sound like a line? Are you disappointed?&quot;</p>
                    <p>56 &quot;Who's a nice girl doing in a place like this?&quot;</p>
                    <p>57 &quot;Do you have a 40 cents?&quot; &quot;Too bad, because 
                      I need to call my mother and tell her I just found the woman 
                      of my dreams.&quot;</p>
                    <p>58 &quot;Do you have a map?&quot; &quot;I just keep on 
                      getting lost in your eyes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>59 &quot;Are you religious? Good, because I'm the answer 
                      to your prayers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>60 &quot;Did it hurt?&quot; &quot;When you fell from heaven?&quot;</p>
                    <p>61 &quot;Inheriting eighty million dollars doesn't mean 
                      much when you have a weak heart.&quot;</p>
                    <p>62 &quot;Excuse me, do you live around here often?&quot;</p>
                    <p>63 &quot;Excuse me, I'm a little short on cash. Mind if 
                      we shared a cab home together?&quot;</p>
                    <p>64 &quot;What's your sign?&quot;</p>
                    <p>65 &quot;Hi, the voices in my head told me to come and 
                      talk to you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>66 &quot;What was that?&quot; &quot;That sound?&quot; &quot;The 
                      sound of my heart breaking?&quot;</p>
                    <p>67 &quot;If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put U &amp; 
                      I together.&quot;</p>
                    <p>68 &quot;I lost my phone number. Can I borrow yours?&quot;</p>
                    <p>69 &quot;I was sitting here holding my cigarette when I 
                      realised I'd rather be holding you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>70 &quot;If your parents hadn't met, I'd be a very unhappy 
                      man right now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>71 &quot;I feel like Richard Gere, standing here next to 
                      you, the Pretty Woman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>72 &quot;Sorry, I thought you were someone else, by the 
                      way, here's my card.&quot;</p>
                    <p>73 &quot;Say, didn't we go to different schools together?&quot;</p>
                    <p>74 &quot;Drop 'em&quot;</p>
                    <p>75 &quot;Would you like to dance or should I go fuck myself 
                      again?&quot;</p>
                    <p>76 &quot;Hey baby, let's make some babies!&quot;</p>
                    <p>77 &quot;I think we have to make love like crazed weasels 
                      on the front lawn NOW!&quot;</p>
                    <p>78 &quot;Hey babe, can you suck a golf ball through 50 
                      feet of garden hose?&quot;</p>
                    <p>79 &quot;Hey babe, can you suck start a Harley?</p>
                    <p>80 &quot;Hey babe, wanna get lucky?&quot;</p>
                    <p>81 To a mother: &quot;Hey mother - want another?&quot;</p>
                    <p>82 To a mother: &quot;What is your favourite position on 
                      extramarital sex?&quot;</p>
                    <p>83 &quot;Your place or mine?&quot;</p>
                    <p>84 &quot;Your place or the mens bathroom?&quot;</p>
                    <p>85 &quot;Your face or mine?&quot;</p>
                    <p>86 &quot;If I told you that you had a great body, would 
                      you hold it against me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>87 &quot;If I told you that you had an ugly body, would 
                      you hold it against me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>88 &quot;Nice tits. Mind if I feel them?&quot;</p>
                    <p>89 &quot;I love you. I want to marry you. Now let's fuck.&quot;</p>
                    <p>90 &quot;Forget that. Playing doctor is for kids, lets 
                      play gynaecologist!&quot;</p>
                    <p>91 &quot;Wanna play carnival? You sit on my face and I 
                      guess how much you weigh.&quot;</p>

                    <p>95 &quot;Excuse me, have I fucked you yet?&quot;</p>
                    <p>96 &quot;I'd give you a piece of my mind, but I have more 
                      of something else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>97 &quot;I would kill or die to make love to you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>98 &quot;Sex is a killer... Want to die happy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>99 &quot;I love every bone in your body, especially mine.&quot;</p>

                      only Avon cosmetics?&quot;</p>
                    <p>107 &quot;You're ugly, but you interest me.&quot;</p>

                    <p>115 &quot;Is it cold outside, or are you just smuggling 
                      tic-tacs?&quot;</p>
                    <p>116 &quot;Pardon me, but I was about to go home and masturbate, 
                      and I was wondering if you'd mind if I fantasize about you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>117 &quot;Sit on my lap and well talk about the first thing 
                      that pops up!&quot;</p>

                    <p>148 &quot;Hello Susie, your mummy couldn't make it this 
                      afternoon. She asked me to pick you up and take you home. 
                      My that's a pretty dress...&quot;</p>
                    <p>149 &quot;I'm really sorry about Al. It was a lovely funeral. 
                      You look ravishing in black, did you know that? What you 
                      need now is a nice back rub. Are the straps too tight darling? 
                      How very, very tragic.&quot;&quot;</p>
                    <p>150 &quot;Do you want to see something swell?&quot;</p>
                    <p>151 &quot;Hey babe, do you know my mouth can generate over 
                      750 psi?&quot;</p>
                    <p>152 &quot;Excuse me. Do you want to fuck or should I apologise?&quot;</p>
                    <p>153 &quot;Wanna fuck like bunnies?</p>
                    <p>154 Follow these instructions:</p>
                    <p>1. Make sure that you are in front of the person you are 
                      trying to attract.</p>
                    <p>2. Put your hands in a vertical plane and seperate your 
                      hands to the desired distance.</p>
                    <p>3. Look at the person of your affections with a shit eating, 
                      ear to ear grin. Shake your head up and down as to reply 
                      that you're this big.</p>
                    <p>155 &quot;What would you do if I kissed you right now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>156 &quot;Take an icecube to the bar, smash it and say: 
                      &quot;Now that I've broken the ice, will you sleep with 
                      me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>157 &quot;I'm single!&quot;</p>
                    <p>158 &quot;Would you like to see my boa constrictor?&quot;</p>
                    <p>159 &quot;I'm drunk.&quot;</p>
                    <p>160 &quot;Would you like to come and party in my toolshed?&quot;</p>
                    <p>161 &quot;Will you marry me and have my children?&quot;</p>
                    <p>162 &quot;You know, I'd really like to fuck your brains 
                      out, but it seems somebody beat me to it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>163 To someone just out of the shower: &quot;Can I borrow 
                      your towel?&quot;</p>
                    <p>164 &quot;I've got an itch. Lower. Lower.&quot;</p>
                    <p>165 &quot;If you want me, don't wake me, or shake me, just 
                      take me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>166 &quot;Hi, I'm a flight steward.&quot;</p>
                    <p>167 &quot;May I please rest my head on your shoulder?&quot;</p>
                    <p>168 &quot;Hold up a vibrator: &quot;Do you know how to 
                      use one of these?&quot;</p>
                    <p>169 &quot;Fuck me if I'm wrong, but haven't we met before?&quot;</p>
                    <p>170 &quot;I'm not trying to pressure you, I don't want 
                      to have sex without mutual consent; Oh and by the way, you 
                      have my consent.&quot;</p>
                    <p>171 &quot;I'm sure you didn't mean to turn me on with your 
                      big ass, but it's too late now!&quot;</p>
                    <p>172 &quot;Hi, I'm taking a survey. Do you spit or swallow?&quot;</p>
                    <p>173 &quot;I think I'm falling in love with you. Now do 
                      you want to fuck?&quot;</p>
                    <p>174 &quot;I haven't seen you in a while, you sure look 
                      different without my dick in your mouth.&quot;</p>
                    <p>175 &quot;Hi. My name's Campbell. You'll be screaming that 
                      later.&quot;</p>

                      while winking)</p>
                    <p>177 &quot;What are you drinking?&quot; (&quot;_______&quot;) 
                      &quot;Wanna screw?&quot;</p>
                    <p>178 &quot;Yo. You'll do.&quot;</p>
