                    <p>I have a little test to see if you are REALLY oversexed. 
                      Since these days, most men would say they are oversexed, 
                      if you asked them; it's probably &quot;normal&quot; to be 
                      oversexed, if that's possible so to be REALLY oversexed, 
                      you would have to be a sex-maniac.<br>
                      Now that's not all bad, you see.<br>
                      If being a little oversexed is good and normal, can being 
                      a sex-maniac be all that bad.<br>
                      So, I'm starting what I hope will be an extensive thread. 
                      It's a test, to see if you might be a sex-maniac, just like 
                      Jeff Foxworthy's test for qualification as a redneck. Feel 
                      free to add tests of your own.<br>
                      You MIGHT be a sex-maniac if. . .<br>
                      Your porn-library is bigger than your stack of taped shows.<br>
                      Your prick (or cunt) and your right hand have matching callouses.<br>
                      Your mother, your aunt, your two sisters, and your dog are 
                      all pregnant, and none of them has a current boyfriend.<br>
                      You think your wife is frigid, because she tells you that, 
                      &quot;Five times a day is too much.&quot;<br>
                      You learned to masturbate before you learned to talk.<br>
                      You're number-3 on Planned Parenthood's list of horror-stories.<br>
                      You're a farmer with cows, chickens, and nanny-goats, but 
                      no bulls, jacks, or cockerels. You don't need them.<br>
                      Your little sister has had three children, but is too young 
                      to date yet.<br>
                      Your mother complains that your father is losing his sex-drive, 
                      and you have to agree. . . He only managed to fuck you three 
                      times last night, so you had to get your little brother 
                      to help.<br>
                      All the other girls are disappointed, when you show up for 
                      the orgy.<br>
                      Your boyfriend asks his brother, father and uncle to help 
                      out, because he just can't keep up. . . And you wonder if 
                      maybe he should invite his grandfather too, as only four 
                      men might not be enough.<br>
                      You're wondering if maybe you should get a boyfriend, because 
                      your father and three brothers just aren't enough any more.<br>
                      Your sister keeps complaining that you steal all her boyfriends, 
                      and you wonder what's bothering her about that.<br>
                      You know more about sex than either of your parents; and 
                      you're only 9.<br>
                      Your condom bill is bigger than your phone bill.<br>
                      You carry 14 different types of prophylactics, and use them 
                      all.<br>
                      Your wife, your mortgage-payment, your mistress, and your 
                      two daughters are all late.<br>
                      You have three boyfriends, and are contemplating getting 
                      a fourth.<br>
                      You can't understand how some girls can get by with just 
                      one boyfriend or husband.<br>
                      You have more than 14 children.<br>
                      You read &quot;Don Juan,&quot; and wonder why he's so undersexed.<br>
                      Your girlfriend takes you to a swinging-party, so that she 
                      can get a rest.<br>
                      You read stories in the (yellow) newspapers about a man 
                      whose wife is divorcing him because he has sex five times 
                      a day, and you think, &quot;That's all?&quot;<br>
                      All the women light up, and all the men are disappointed, 
                      when you show up at a swinging-party with the sexiest girl 
                      in town.<br>
                      You can quote the entire dialog of &quot;Taboo II.&quot;<br>
                      You like to drink cum, but think it's a waste.<br>
                      Your idea of getting &quot;dressed up&quot; does not involve 
                      more than 8 ounces of clothing.<br>
                      You go to an orgy to pick up women.<br>
                      You go to an orgy to pick up men.<br>
                      You're a 25-year-old woman, and haven't had a period in 
                      10 years.<br>
                      Your little brother groans, and asks, &quot;Why don't you 
                      sleep with Daddy tonight?&quot;<br>
                      Your husband takes you to a swinging party, and tells you 
                      he'll pick you up, after it's over.<br>
                      You think the person who wrote &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; 
                      was a piker.<br>
                      You're on a first-name basis with the people down at the 
                      health clinic.<br>
                      The local hooker walks out, when she sees you enter the 
                      bar.<br>
                      You're being named in more than three paternity suits at 
                      once.<br>
                      You're being named in two or more paternity suits, and at 
                      least two of them are relatives.<br>
                      Your daughter has three children, but isn't old enough to 
                      go out on a date.<br>
                      You go to the pound to pick out a dog, and take the one 
                      that starts humping your leg.<br>
                      Your stack of real porno-mags, is higher than your stack 
                      of Playboy magazines.<br>
                      Your little sister is afraid to invite you to spend the 
                      night at her house, because she doesn't want your daughter 
                      to get pregnant.</p>
